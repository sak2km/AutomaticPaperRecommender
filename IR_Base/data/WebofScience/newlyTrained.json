Precise transport measurements need to verify the transport mechanism of twin GB in MoS2. Here, monolayer molybdenum disulphide with a twin grain boundary was grown in our developed low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system, and we investigated how the twin GB affects the electrical transport properties of MoS2 by temperature-dependent transport studies. At low temperature, the twin GB can increase the in-plane electrical conductivity of MoS2 and the transport exhibits variable-range hopping (VRH), while at high temperature, the twin GB impedes the electrical transport of MoS2 and the transport exhibits nearest-neighbor hopping (NNH). Our results elucidate carrier transport mechanism of twin GB and give an important indication of twin GB in tailoring the electronic properties of MoS2 for its applications in next-generation electronics and optoelectronic devices.","Title":"The Effect of Twin Grain Boundary Tuned by Temperature on the Electrical Transport Properties of Monolayer MoS2"}],"ProductInfo":{"Name":"","Price":"","ProductID":"B00007FHEN","ImgURL":"","Features":""}}
