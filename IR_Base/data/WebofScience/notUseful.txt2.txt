Electronic and magnetic properties of 1T-HfS2 by doping transition-metal atoms
Abstract:
We explored the electronic and magnetic properties of 1T-HfS2 doped by transition metal (TM) atom using the first-principles calculation. We doped the transition metal atoms from the IIIB to VIB groups in nonmagnetic 1T-HfS2. Numerical results show that the pristine 1T-HfS2 is a semiconductor with indirect gaps of 1.250 eV. Magnetism can be observed for V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Cu doping. The polarized charges mainly arise from the localized 3d electrons of the TM atom. The strong p-d hybridization was found between the 3d orbitals of TM and 3p orbitals of S. The substituted 1T-HfS2 can be a metal, semiconductor or half-metal. Analysis of the band structure and magnetic properties indicates that TM-doped HfS2 (TM=V, Fe, Cu) are promising systems to explore two-dimensional diluted magnetic semiconductors. The formation energy calculations also indicate that it is energetically favorable and relatively easier to incorporate transition metal atom into the HfS2 under S-rich experimental conditions. In contrast, V doped HfS2 has relatively wide half-metallic gap and low formation energy. So V-doped 1T-HfS2 is ideal for spin injection, which is important for application in semiconductor spintronics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two-dimensional lateral heterojunction through bandgap engineering of MoS2 via oxygen plasma
Abstract:
The present study explores the structural, optical (photoluminescence (PL)), and electrical properties of lateral heterojunctions fabricated by selective exposure of mechanically exfoliated few layer two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) flakes under oxygen (O-2)-plasma. Raman spectra of the plasma exposed MoS2 flakes show a significant loss in the structural quality due to lattice distortion and creation of oxygen-containing domains in comparison to the pristine part of the same flake. The PL mapping evidences the complete quenching of peak A and B consistent with a change in the exciton states of MoS2 after the plasma treatment, indicating a significant change in its band gap properties. The electrical transport measurements performed across the pristine and the plasma-exposed MoS2 flake exhibit a gate tunable current rectification behavior with a rectification ratio up to 1.3 x 10(3) due to the band-offset at the pristine and plasma-exposed MoS2 interface. Our Raman, PL, and electrical transport data confirm the formation of an excellent lateral heterojunction in 2D MoS2 through its bandgap modulation via oxygen plasma.

Uniform Deposition of Co3O4 Nanosheets on Exfoliated MoS2 Nanosheets as Advanced Catalysts for Water Splitting
Abstract:
Sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottleneck for water splitting. Herein, an ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheet is uniformly deposited on the chemical exfoliated MoS2 nanosheet (ex-MoS2) via an in-situ hydrolysis and epitaxial growth. These novel noble-metal-free OER catalysts were proposed as an excellent platform for water splitting to promote the oxygen evolution activity and stability.MoS2 introduction can improve the conductivity of Co3O4 nanosheets, generate more Co3+ species in Co3O4 nanosheets during electrochemical activation and render high durability against dissolution of Co3O4 nanosheets in high potential polarization. As a result, these novel Co3O4/ex-MoS2 hybrids exhibit an excellent OER activity with a remarkable low Tafel slope (ca. 36 mV dec(-1)), and a substantially small overpotential (ca. 290 mV required for 10 mA cm(-2)). Their OER stability is also outstanding, with 95.2% OER activity retention for 10000 potential cyclings. The superior OER performance is compatible to, and even better than state of art OER catalysts reported recently. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: 
Transport in disordered monolayer MoS2 nanoflakes-evidence for inhomogeneous charge transport Abstract:We study charge transport in a monolayer MoS2 nanoflake over a wide range of carrier density, temperature and electric bias. We find that the transport is best described by a percolating picture in which the disorder breaks translational invariance, breaking the system up into a series of puddles, rather than previous pictures in which the disorder is treated as homogeneous and uniform. Our work provides insight to a unified picture of charge transport in monolayer MoS2 nanoflakes and contributes to the development of next-generationMoS2-based devices.

In-Situ hydrothermal synthesis of a MoS2 nanosheet electrode for electrochemical energy storage applications
Abstract:
A molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheet film was grown directly on a stainless-steel substrate by using an in-situ hydrothermalgrowth technique at 200 A degrees C. The formation of an MoS2 hexagonal structure with a nanosheet-like morphology was confirmed by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) while a layered MoS2 nanosheet structure was observed under an energy-filtering transmission electron microscope (EF-TEM). The electrochemical supercapacitor properties of the MoS2 nanosheet electrode were measured in 1-M aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge/discharge technique, and the electrode's specific capacitances were 91.29 F/g and 146.15 F/g, respectively. The concurrent double-layer capacitance and pseudo-capacitance behaviors of the electrode manifested themselves in the rectangular shape and redox peaks of the CV curve. The mesoporous MoS2 nanosheets were electrochemically stable for up to 1000 charge/discharge cycles.

Title: 
Electrostrictive Tunable Capacitors and High-Performance 2D Crystal Transistors for Energy-Efficient Applications
Abstract:
Tunable capacitors based on electrostriction in piezoelectric barriers are presented. Electrostriction leads to a modulation of the piezoelectric barrier layer thickness caused by electrostatic attractive forces between the plates of a capacitor under applied voltage. Using this mechanism, a high range of capacitance values with a high capacitance tuning ratio, and wide tunability are obtained. Furthermore, using this electrostrictive piezoelectric capacitor in the gate stack of a two-dimensional (2D) crystal transistor, such asMoS2 transistor, a higher gate capacitance and an ON-current boost are obtained. This allows the transistor switch to operate at a smaller bias voltage in energy-efficient applications.

Synthesis of uniform WS2 nanoflowers via a sodium silicate-assisted hydrothermal process
Abstract:
The three-dimensional architectures often exhibit good functional properties. In current work, the unique WS2 nanoflowers self-assembled by nanosheets have been successfully synthesized via a novel hydrothermal method with the assistance of sodium silicate. A possible growth mechanism was further proposed in detail. The obtained WS2 nanoflowers showed a very excellent optical absorption properties and holds substantial promise for rendering WS2 as an excellent visible photocatalyst material. Such a synthetic way may open up an avenue to tailor the morphologies of some other transition metal disulfides and enhance their functional performance.

Title: 
Ionic liquid assisted hydrothermal synthesis of uniform MoS2 microspheres using (NH4)(2)MoS4 as precursors
Abstract:
MoS2 nanoflowers were successfully synthesized by a simple hydrothermal process with the help of a surfactant. The products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). X-ray diffraction results showed that the as-prepared product was the hexagonal phase ofMoS2 without any impurity. TEM and SEM images showed that the MoS2 nanoflowers had uniform sizes with diameter of about 1-2 mu m and were constructed with many irregular nanosheets as a petal-like structure with thickness of several nanometers. A possible formation mechanism of the MoS2 nanoflowers was preliminarily proposed on the basis of observations of a time-dependent morphology evolution process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Title: 
Two-step Synthesis of MoS2 Nanotubes using Shock Waves with Lead as GrowthPromoter
Abstract:
A new two-step procedure for the synthesis of MoS2 nanotubes using lead as a growth promoter is reported. In the first step, molybdenum suboxide nanowhiskers containing a small amount of lead atoms were created by exposing a pressed MoS2+Pb mixture to highly compressed shock-heated argon gas, with estimated temperatures exceeding 9900 K. In the second step, these molybdenum suboxide nanowhiskers served as templates for the sulfidization of the oxide into MoS2 nanotubes (by using H2S gas in a reducing atmosphere at 820 degrees C). Unlike the case of WS2 nanotubes, the synthesis of a pure phase of MoS2 nanotubes from molybdenum oxide has proven challenging, due mostly to the volatile nature of the latter at the high requisite reaction temperatures (>800 degrees C). In contrast, the nature and apparent reaction mechanism of the method reported herein are amenable to future scale-up. The high-temperature shockwave system should also facilitate the synthesis of new nanostructures from other layered materials.

Millisecond Laser Ablation of Molybdenum Target in Reactive Gas toward MoS2Fullerene-Like Nanoparticles with Thermally Stable Photoresponse
Abstract:
As a promising material for photoelectrical application, MoS2 has attracted extensive attention on its facile synthesis and unique properties. Herein, we explored a novel strategy of laser ablation to synthesize MoS2 fullerene-like nanoparticles (FL-NPs) with stable photoresponse under high temperature. Specifically, we employed a millisecond pulsed laser to ablate the molybdenum target in dimethyl trisulfide gas, and as a result, the molybdenum nanodroplets were ejected from the target and interacted with the highly reactive ambient gas to produce MoS2 FL-NPs. In contrast, the laser ablation in liquid could only produce core-shell nanoparticles. The crucial factors for controlling final nanostructures were found to be laser intensity, cooling rate, and gas reactivity. Finally, the MoS2 FL-NPs were assembled into a simple photoresponse device which exhibited excellent thermal stability, indicating their great potentialities for high-temperature photoelectrical applications.

Sequential structural and optical evolution of MoS2 by chemical synthesis and exfoliation
Abstract:
Various types of MoS2 structures are successfully obtained by using economical and facile sequential synthesis and exfoliation methods. Spherically-shaped lumps of multilayer (ML) MoS2 are prepared by using a conventional hydrothermal method and were subsequently 1st-exfoliated in hydrazine while being kept in autoclave to be unrolled and separated into five-to-six-layer MoS2 pieces of several-hundred nm in size. The MoS2 MLs are 2nd-exfoliated in sodium naphthalenide under an Ar ambient to finally produce bilayerMoS2 crystals of similar to 100 nm. The sequential exfoliation processes downsize MoS2 laterally and reduce its number of layers. The three types of MoS2 allotropes exhibit particular optical properties corresponding to their structural differences. These results suggest that two-dimensional MoS2 crystals can be prepared by employing only chemical techniques without starting from high-pressure-synthesized bulk MoS2 crystals.

Heterodoped nanoflakes: synthesis and characterization of sulfur-doped NbSe2 nanoflakes
Abstract:
Doping of NbSe2 with heteroatoms is an effective way to tailor its properties. Here, solid phase synthesis process has been utilized for growing uniform and excellent crystalline nano-NbSe2 by sulfur dopant during the growing process. The sulfur-doped mechanism of nano-NbS2xSe2(1-x)(x= 0.03 approximate to 0.2) has been investigated: the sulfur atoms not only replace the Se position but also intercalate in layer gap by one-step reaction. In the structure of NbSe2, the sulfur atoms replace the positions of Se atoms and then are located in the empty octahedral positions of van der waals gap between the NbSe2 layers with the increase of sulfur content. The lubrication properties of the as-prepared NbSe2 and sulfur-doped NbSe2 powders as additives in HVI1500 base oil were discussed. The lubrication properties of base oil was improved by both NbSe2 and sulfur-doped NbSe2. Furthermore, the lubrication properties of sulfur-doped (0.1at%) NbSe2 are better than those of pure NbSe2 in HVI1500 base oil, which could be attributed to their thin laminated structure and the sulfur dopant.

Title: 
Photo-Promoted Platinum Nanoparticles Decorated MoS2@Graphene Woven Fabric Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Generation
Abstract:
Hydrogen production from water splitting has been considered as an effective and sustainable method to solve future energy related crisis. Molybdenum sulfides (e.g., MoS2) show promising catalytic ability in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Combining MoS2 with conductive carbon based materials has aroused tremendous research interest recently. In this work, a highly efficient multiple-catalyst is developed for HER by decorating Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) on MoS2@graphene protected nickel woven fabrics (NiWF) substrate, which comprises the following components: (i) Graphene protected NiWF acts as the underlying substrate, supporting the whole structure; (ii) MoS2 nanoplates serve as a central and essential photosensitive component, forming a heterostructure with graphene simultaneously; and (iii) on the basis of the intrinsic photoluminescence effect of MoS2, together with the photoelectric response at theMoS2/graphene interface, Pt NPs are successfully deposited on the whole structure under illumination. Particularly and foremost, this work emphasizes on discussion and verification of the underlying mechanism for photopromoted electroless Pt NPs deposition. Due to this assembly approach, the usage amount of Pt is controlled at similar to 5 wt % (similar to 0.59 at. %) with respect to the whole catalyst. MoS2@Substrate with Pt NPs deposited under 643 nm illumination, with the synergistic effect of MoS2 active sites and Pt NPs, demonstrates the most superior electrocatalytic performance, with negligible overpotential and low Tafel slope of 39.4 mV/dec.

Growth, Characterization of Epitaxial Heterostructures of Ultrathin Bi2Te3 Nanoplates on Few-Layer MoS2 Films
Abstract:
Ultrathin topological insulator Bi2Te3 nanoplates with well-defined orientations have been fabricated on few-layer MoS2 films via van der Weals epitaxial growth. Electrostatic properties of the epitaxial heterostructures were systematically investigated by Kelvin probe force microscopy under ambient conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that charge exchange exists at the interface, resulting in doping to ultrathin Bi2Te3 nanoplates from few-layer MoS2 substrate. These results may provide a route to investigate the electronic and spintronic properties of topological insulators.

Ni3S2@MoS2 core/shell nanorod arrays on Ni foam for high-performance electrochemical energy storage
Abstract:
In this paper, using Ni3S2@MoS2 as an example, we report the successful design and synthesis of a novel hybrid core/shell metal sulfides with a conductive Ni3S2 core by a green, scalable and one-step solution strategy. When they are tested as supercapacitor electrodes, the Ni3S2@MoS2 heterostructure exhibits about 2 times the capacitance (848 F g(-1)) compared to the pristine Ni3S2 sample (425 F g(-1)), excellent rate capability (46.6% capacity retention at 20 A g(-1)) and outstanding cycling stability (91% retention after 2000 cycles). The enhancement is ascribed to the robust hierarchical core/shell structures which provide an increased reaction area and a close contact of electrolyte with the active material. In addition, a highly conductive 1D core material endows the quick transport of electrons along Ni3S2 nanorods to Ni foam. It is prospected that such novel hybrids can offer great potential promise in large-scale energy storage device applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: 
MoS2 Nanoribbon Transistors: Transition From Depletion Mode to Enhancement Mode by Channel-Width Trimming
Abstract:
We study the channel width scaling of back-gated MoS2 metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors from 2 mu m down to 60 nm. We reveal that the channel conductance scales linearly with channel width, indicating no evident edge damage for MoS2 nanoribbons with widths down to 60 nm as defined by plasma dry etching. However, these transistors show a strong positive threshold voltage (V-T) shift with narrow channel widths of less than 200 nm. Our results also show that transistors with thinner channel thicknesses have larger V-T shifts associated with width scaling. Devices fabricated on a 6-nm-thick MoS2 crystal underwent the transition from depletion mode to enhancement mode.

Microwave Synthesized Three-dimensional Hierarchical Nanostructure CoS2/MoS2 Growth on Carbon Fiber Cloth: A Bifunctional Electrode for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction and Supercapacitor
Abstract:
In this work, we demonstrate the synthesis of three-dimensional hierarchical nanostructured cobalt disulfide/molybdenum disulfidegrowth on carbon fiber cloth (CoS2/MoS2/CC) for hydrogen evolution reaction and supercapacitor. CoS2 nanoparticles anchor on flower-like MoS2 nanosheets grown on CC by a two-step procedure via facile single mode microwave-assisted hydrothermal technique. It was observed that CoS2/MoS2 nanocomposites were uniformly dispersed on CC and CoS2 nanoparticles were wrapped by flower-likeMoS2 nanosheets. Remarkably, the binder-free CoS2/MoS2/CC maintains its activity after 1000 cycles and exhibits superior catalytic activity in hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low overpotential of 177 mV to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 66 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, the bifunctional CoS2/MoS2/CC for supercapacitor delivers a higher specific capacitance of 406 F/g and excellent long-life cycling stability, retaining 95.27% of the initial capacitance after 10000 cycles. The enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction and supercapacitor property may be ascribed to the synergistic effect between metallic CoS2 and MoS2, moreover more electrochemical accessible active sites and fast electron transport path can be obtained.

Title: 
A novel hydrogen peroxide biosensor based on immobilized hemoglobin in 3D flower-like MOS2 microspheres structure
Abstract:
A three-dimensional flower-like MOS2 microspheres were prepared and employed to immobilize hemoglobin (Hb) in order to fabricate a novel biosensor. The products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical properties of the designed Nafion/Hb/MoS2/GC electrode were investigated by the cyclic voltammograms (CVs). The experimental results show that M0S2 was three-dimensional flower-like microspheres assembled by bent flakes with thickness of about several nanometers, and the diameter of these spheres was approximate 600 nm. Moreover, there were many pores with different diameters consisting of nanosheets on the surface of the MoS2 hierarchical structures. The resulting biosensor displayed a high sensitivity, good reproducibility and long-time stability, and the wide linear range and detection limit was 20-180 mu mol L-1 and 6.7 mu mol L-1 for the detection of H2O2.

Ionic liquid assisted hydrothermal synthesis of hollow vesicle-like MoS2microspheres
Abstract:
The preparation of MoS2 microspheres with hollow vesicle-like structure was successfully achieved, which used hydrazine solution with (NH4)(2)MOS4 as the precursor. The reaction process was assisted by a convenient ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride) with the hydrothermal method at 200 degrees C for 24 h. X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) techniques were used to characterize the samples. It was shown that the MoS2 microspheres had uniform spherical morphology with the diameter of 1-2 mu m. It was also indicated that the hollow vesicle monomers on the surface of microspheres were structured with multi-layer of MoS2, whose d spacing was 1.0 nm. A tentative formation mechanism was proposed for the growth process of the MoS2 microspheres with hollow vesicle-like structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hydrothermal synthesis and characterization of 3D flower-like MoS2 microspheres
Abstract:
Three-dimensional (3D) flower-like MoS2 microspheres with diameter of about 4 mu m were successfully synthesized by a facile hydrotherrnal solution reaction method, using hexaammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)(6)Mo7O24) and thiourea as the precursors. As-prepared MoS2 samples were characterized by XRD, EDS, SEM, and TEM. SEM results showed that the obtained 3D flower-like MoS2 microspheres are comprised of very thin nanosheets with the thickness about 20 nm. The influence of reaction time on the formation of MoS2 microspheres was investigated. A possible growth mechanism is proposed to explain the formation of MoS2microspheres on the basis of observations of a time-dependent morphology evolution process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract:
Ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets at large scale were successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal solution reaction method, using hexaammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)(6)Mo7O24) and thiourea as the precursors. The final products were characterized by XRD, EDS, SEM and TEM. TEM and SEM images showed that the thickness of the obtained MoS2 nanosheets was similar to 4 nm and the lateral size of the sheets was in the range of 200-400 nm. The influence of reaction temperature and time on the formation ofMoS2 nanosheets was discussed. A possible growth mechanism is proposed to explain the formation of MoS2 nanosheets on the basis of observations of a time-dependent morphology evolution process.

Fast and Efficient Preparation of Exfoliated 2H MoS2 Nanosheets by Sonication-Assisted Lithium Intercalation and Infrared Laser-Induced 1T to 2H Phase Reversion
Abstract:
Exfoliated 2H molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has unique properties and potential applications in a wide range of fields, but corresponding studies have been hampered by the lack of effective routes to it in bulk quantities. This study presents a rapid and efficient route to obtain exfoliated 2H MoS2, which combines fast sonication-assisted lithium intercalation and infrared (IR) laser-induced phase reversion. We found that the complete lithium intercalation of MoS2 with butyllithium could be effected within 1.5 h with the aid of sonication. The 2H to IT phase transition that occurs during the lithium intercalation could be also reversed by IR laser irradiation with a DVD optical drive.

Horizontal growth of MoS2 nanowires by chemical vapour deposition
Abstract:
We describe a single step route for the synthesis of MoS2 wires using a chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method. By tuning the CVDgrowth parameters, the horizontally oriented MoS2 nanowires on SiO2/Si substrate can be synthesized successfully. The MoS2nanowire has height of about 93 nm and width of about 402 nm with multilayer structure. Good local photoluminescence (PL) properties can be observed for these horizontal MoS2 nanowires. The successful fabrication and prominent PL effect of the horizontal MoS2nanowires provide potential applications for the MoS2-based in planar devices.

Bulk Mg2Si based n-type thermoelectric material produced by gas atomization and hot extrusion
Abstract:
Bulk thermoelectric (TE) materials for large scale energy harvesting applications need to demonstrate not only high TE performance, but should also be composed from elements which are nontoxic, largely available in nature, and preferably be as light as possible for applications such as automobiles. Magnesium silicide based materials possess a combination of these properties and are among the best candidates for these applications. For the successful implementation of Mg2Si based alloys, all material manufacturing steps have to be compatible with the requirements of mass production. We report two processes to manufacture these alloys which can be easily scaled up: (i) a gas atomization method for powder production, followed by (ii) hot extrusion to obtain bulk specimens. The Mg2Si1-xSnx (0.3 <= x <= 0.7) powders were prepared by gas atomization using a stoichiometric mixture of the commercially available high purity elements. Particle size distribution analysis shows that 90% of particles thus obtained have sizes ranging from 10 to 100 mu m with a mean value of 46.5 mu m. Hot extrusion was carried out for Mg2Si0.4Sn0.6 composition at 450-480 degrees C and 500-550 degrees C applying pressures up to 1 GPa. Addition of 4 vol% of nanometre sized MoS2 particles in the powder facilitates material densification. Specimens extruded at temperature range of 500-550 degrees C demonstrate 99.7% of the theoretical density. The TE properties were studied by the Harman method between 300 K and 700 K. The Seebeck coefficient varies from -150 to -220 mu V/K, passing through a maximum value at 450 K. The electrical conductivity of 88 S/cm at 300 K increases with temperature showing a typical behavior for under-doped TE material. The ZT value reaches a maximum of 0.08 at 620 K. Our work shows that implementation of a gas atomization process for powder production combined with hot extrusion, as a densification and sintering method, can be successfully implemented for bulk Mg2Si1-xSnx manufacturing. This approach to obtain Mg2Si based alloys, once optimized, has a great potential for large scale waste heat recovery applications. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Spin- and valley-coupled electronic states in monolayer WSe2 on bilayer graphene
Abstract:
We have fabricated a high-quality monolayer WSe2 film on bilayer graphene by epitaxial growth and revealed the electronic states by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We observed a direct energy gap at the Brillouin-zone corner in contrast to the indirect nature of gap in bulk WSe2, which is attributed to the lack of interlayer interaction and the breaking of space-inversion symmetry in monolayer film. A giant spin splitting of similar to 0.5 eV, which is the largest among known monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, is observed in the energy band around the zone corner. The present results suggest a high potential applicability of WSe2 to develop advanced devices based with the coupling of spin-and valley-degrees of freedom. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

Hydrothermal synthesis of variety low dimensional WS2 nanostructures
Abstract:
We report a successful fabrication of tungsten disulfide (WS2) nanostructures with different morphologies including rod-like, sheet-like and fiber-like ones via a simple yet facile hydrothermal process by adding surfactants cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The structural features of the as-prepared WS2 are characterized systematically by the X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. We find that the surfactants play a critical role in producing low dimensional WS2 structures with different morphologies. We also propose growth mechanisms for the various WS2 morphologies. The simple fabrication of WS2 nanostructures can also be applied for the synthesis of other transition metal sulfides with novel nanostructures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Oriented Growth of Gold Nanowires on MoS2
Abstract:
Layered 2D materials serve as a new class of substrates for templated synthesis of various nanomaterials even with highly dissimilar crystal structures; thus overcoming the lattice constraints of conventional epitaxial processes. Here, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is used as a prototypical model substrate for oriented growth of in-plane Au nanowires (NWs) despite the nearly 8% lattice mismatch between MoS2 and Au. Au NWs on the MoS2 surface are oriented along three symmetrically equivalent directions within the substrate arising from the strong Au-S binding that templates the oriented growth. The kinetics of the growth process are explored through experiments and modeling. Strong charge transfer is observed between Au NWs and MoS2, resulting in degenerate p-doping of MoS2.

Molybdenum disulfide microflowers assembled by few-layered nanosheets and their electrochemical 
Abstract:
MoS2 microflowers are fabricated by a facile hydrothermal route with polyquaternary ammonium salt (Polyquaternium-11, PQA) as a soft template. The experimental results indicate that the MoS2 micro flowers are of hexagonal phases and have a hierarchical flower-like morphology, which are assembled by numerous few-layered nanosheets. A probable assembly process is proposed to illustrate the formation of the MoS2 microflowers. Additionally, as an electrode material for supercapacitor, the resultant MoS2 microflowers demonstrate a superior electrochemical property which could be attributed to their robust hierarchical architectures and few -layered feature.

Facile synthesis of MoS2/RGO in dimethyl-formamide solvent as highly efficient catalyst for hydrogen evolution
Abstract:
MoS2/RGO nanocomposites as highly effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have been synthesized by one-pot solvothermal route using dimethyl-formamide (DMF) as solvent For comparison, MoS2/RGO has also been prepared in pure H2O and H2O-DMF mixture. The good dispersion of MoS2 nanoparticles on the surface of MoS2/RGO obtained in DMF can be seen from TEM and SEM images, which implying the more active sites for HER. The electrocatalytic measurements confirm that the obtainedMoS2/RGO in DMF exhibits the smaller onset overpotential of 130 mV and lower tafel slop of 42 mV dec(-1), which indicating the better electrocatalytic activity than MoS2/RGO in H2O or H2O-DMF mixture. It may be attributed to the better role of DMF on dispersing RGO and controlling the growth of MoS2. Therefore, DMF may be the more suitable solvent for preparing excellent electrocatalysts for HER than H2O. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

n- and p-Type Doping Phenomenon by Artificial DNA and M-DNA on Two-Dimensional Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Abstract:
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanotechnology holds great potential for the development of extremely small devices with increasingly complex functionality. However, most current research related to DNA is limited to crystal growth and synthesis. In addition, since controllable doping methods like ion implantation can cause fatal crystal damage to 2D TMD materials, it is very hard to achieve a low-level doping concentration (nondegenerate regime) on TMD in the present state of technology. Here, we report a nondegenerate doping phenomenon for TMD materials (MoS2 and WSe2, which represent n- and p-channel materials, respectively) using DNA and slightly modified DNA by metal ions (Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Cu2+), named as M-DNA. This study is an example of interdisciplinary convergence research between DNA nanotechnology and TMD-based 2D device technology. The phosphate backbone (PO4) in DNA attracts and holds hole carriers in the TMD region, n-doping the TMD films. Conversely, M-DNA nanostructures, which are functionalized by intercalating metal ions, have positive dipole moments and consequently reduce the electron carrier density of TMD materials, resulting in p-doping phenomenon. N-doping by DNA occurs at similar to 6.4 x 10(1)0 cm(-2) on MoS2 and similar to 7.3 x 10(9) cm(-2) on WSe2, which is uniform across the TMD area. p-Doping which is uniformly achieved by M-DNA occurs between 2.3 x 10(10) and 5.5 x 10(10) cm(-2) on MoS2 and between 2.4 x 10(10) and 5.0 x 10(10) cm(-2) on WSe2. These doping levels are in the nondegenerate regime, allowing for the proper design of performance parameters of TMD-based electronic and optoelectronic devices (V-TH, on-/off-currents, field-effect mobility, photoresponsivity, and detectivity). In addition, by controlling the metal ions used, the p-doping level of TMD materials, which also influences their performance parameters, can be controlled. This interdisciplinary convergence research will allow for the successful integration of future layered semiconductor devices requiring extremely small and very complicated structures.

PtW/MoS2 hybrid nanocomposite for electrochemical sensing of H2O2 released from living cells
Abstract:
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an important reactive oxygen species (ROS) is reactive and potentially harmful to cells, causing oxidation of lipids, proteins and DNA. Herein, we report a PtW/MoS2 hybrid nanocomposite with ultrasensitive and highly specific response for the detection of H2O2 released from breast cancer 4T1 cells. Upon exposure to 5 nM of H2O2, the electrochemical response is still visible. This PtW/MoS2 hybrid nanocomposite could be facilely synthesized through in-situ growth of PtW nano crystals on the surface of MoS2nanosheets. The incorporation of PtW nanocrystals and MoS2 nanosheets in conjunction with each other to form hybrid nanocomposite improves the selective interaction of H2O2 with sensing material surface, and further increases the sensitivity and selectivity of sensor.

Compliant substrate epitaxy: Au on MoS2
Abstract:
A theory for the epitaxial growth of Au on MoS2 is developed and analyzed. The theory combines continuum linear elasticity theory with density functional theory to analyze epitaxial growth in this system. It is demonstrated that if one accounts for interfacial energies and strains, the presence of misfit dislocations, and the compliance of the MoS2 substrate, the experimentally observed growth orientation is favored despite the fact that it represents a larger elastic mismatch than two competing structures. The stability of the experimentally preferred orientation is attributed to the formation of a large number of strong Au-S bonds, and it is noted that this strong bond may serve as a means to exfoliate and transfer large single layers sheets of MoS2, as well as to engineer strain within single layers of MoS2. The potential for using a van der Waals-bonded layered material as a compliant substrate for applications in 2D electronic devices and epitaxial thin film growth is discussed.

Effect of Mo Content on the Structural and Mechanical Properties of CrMoN/MoS2Composite Coatings
Abstract:
CrMoN/MoS2 composite coatings were prepared on the surfaces of the CrMoN composite coatings with different Mo contents by means of a low temperature ion sulfurizing process. The structural and mechanical properties of these coatings as a function of Mo content have been studied. SEM analysis shows that the CrMoN coating reveals a dense and compact surface structure, the CrMoN/MoS2composite coatings display loose grain structures; In the sulfurizing process, a preferential growth does not happen, the sulfide size is inhibited, The products of the reaction between MoNx and S are the main origin of MoS2.Nanoindentation test shows that the hardness and Young's modulus of CrMoN/MoS2 coatings are higher than that of CrMoN composite coatings.

Atomic Layer Deposition of a High-k Dielectric on MoS2 Using Trimethylaluminum and Ozone
Abstract:
We present an Al2O3 dielectric layer on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD) with ozone/trimethylaluminum (TMA) and water/TMA as precursors. The results of atomic force microscopy and low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy show that using TMA and ozone as precursors leads to the formation of uniform Al2O3 layers, in contrast to the incomplete coverage we observe when using TMA/H2O as precursors. Our Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements indicate minimal variations in the MoS2 structure after ozone treatment at 200 degrees C, suggesting its excellent chemical resistance to ozone.

Persistent photoconductivity in two-dimensional Mo1-xWxSe2-MoSe2 van der Waals heterojunctions
Abstract:
Van der Waals (vdW) heterojunctions consisting of vertically-stacked individual or multiple layers of two-dimensional layered semiconductors, especially the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), show novel optoelectronic functionalities due to the sensitivity of their electronic and optical properties to strong quantum confinement and interfacial interactions. Here, monolayers of n-type MoSe2 and p-type Mo1-xWxSe2 are grown by vapor transport methods, then transferred and stamped to form artificial vdW heterostructures with strong interlayer coupling as proven in photoluminescence and low-frequency Raman spectroscopy measurements. Remarkably, the heterojunctions exhibit an unprecedented photoconductivity effect that persists at room temperature for several days. This persistent photoconductivity is shown to be tunable by applying a gate bias that equilibrates the charge distribution. These measurements indicate that such ultrathin vdW heterojunctions can function as rewritable optoelectronic switches or memory elements under time-dependent photo-illumination, an effect which appears promising for new monolayer TMDs-based optoelectronic devices applications.

Formation and diffusion characteristics of Pt clusters on Graphene, 1H-MoS2 and 1T-TaS2
Abstract:
Many experiments have revealed that the surfaces of graphene and graphene-like structures can play an active role as a host surface for clusterization of transition metal atoms. Motivated by these observations, we investigate theoretically the adsorption, diffusion and magnetic properties of Pt clusters on three different two-dimensional atomic crystals using first principles density functional theory. We found that monolayers of graphene, molybdenum disulfide (1H-MoS2) and tantalum disulfide (1T-TaS2) provide different nucleation characteristics for Pt cluster formation. At low temperatures, while the bridge site is the most favorable site where the growth of a Pt cluster starts on graphene, top-Mo and top-Ta sites are preferred on 1H-MoS2 and 1T-TaS2, respectively. Ground state structures and magnetic properties of Pt-n clusters (n= 2,3,4) on three different monolayer crystal structures are obtained. We found that the formation of Pt-2 dimer and a triangle-shaped Pt-3 cluster perpendicular to the surface are favored over the three different surfaces. While bent rhombus shaped Pt-4 is formed on graphene, the formation of tetrahedral shaped clusters are more favorable on 1H-MoS2 and 1T-TaS2. Our study of the formation of Pt-n clusters on three different monolayers provides a gateway for further exploration of nanocluster formations on various surfaces.

Title: 
Width- and edge-dependent magnetic properties, electronic structures, and stability of SnSe2 nanoribbons
Abstract:
First-principles calculations were employed to investigate the magnetic, electronic properties as well as the stability of SnSe2 nanoribbons with zigzag and armchair terminated edges. The results showed that all of the nanoribbons studied are nonmagnetic semiconductors, irrespective of the ribbons width and the shape of the edge. Among these, the zigzag nanoribbons (ZNRs) have direct band gaps and the band gap oscillations depend on the width, while the armchair nanoribbons (ANRs) have indirect band gaps and the band gap converges to a constant value of 0.46 eV as the ribbon width increases. The stabilities of these nanoribbons were evaluated. It was found that the binding energies of ZNRs and ANRs increase monotonically with the increase of ribbon widths. With the comparable widths, ZNR is more stable than ANR. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Electrical transport properties of individual WS2 nanotubes and their dependence on water and oxygen absorption
Abstract:
The electrical properties of WS2 nanotubes (NTs) were studied through measuring 59 devices. Important electrical parameters, such as the carrier concentration, mobility, and effective barrier height at the contacts, were obtained through fitting experimental non-linear I-V curves using a metal-semiconductor-metal model. The carrier mobility was found to be several orders of magnitude higher than that have been reported previously for WS2 NTs. Water absorption was found to decrease the conductivity and carrier mobility of the NTs, and could be removed when the sample was dried. Oxygen absorption also slightly decreased the conductivity of WS2 NTs. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4752440]

Title: 
Chemical Vapor Sensing with Mono layer MoS2
Abstract:
Two-dimensional materials such as graphene show great potential for future nanoscale electronic devices. The high surface-to-volume ratio is a natural asset for applications such as chemical sensing, where perturbations to the surface resulting in charge redistribution are readily manifested in the transport characteristics. Here we show that single monolayer MoS2 functions effectively as a chemical sensor, exhibiting highly selective reactivity to a range of analytes and providing sensitive transduction of transient surface physisorption events to the conductance of the monolayer channel. We find strong response upon exposure to triethylamine, a decomposition product of the V-series nerve gas agents. We discuss these results in the context of analyte/sensor interaction in which the analyte serves as either an electron donor or acceptor, producing a temporary charge perturbation of the sensor material. We find highly selective response to electron donors and little response to electron acceptors, consistent with the weak n-type character of our MoS2. The MoS2sensor exhibits a much higher selectivity than carbon nanotube-based sensors.

Title: 
Correlation patterns and effect of syngas conversion level for product selectivity to alcohols and hydrocarbons over molybdenum sulfide based catalysts
Abstract:
The focus of the present study was to investigate the effect of the operation conditions, space velocity and temperature, on product distribution for a K-Ni-MoS2 catalyst for mixed alcohol synthesis from syngas. All experiments were performed at 91 bar pressure and constant H-2/CO=1 syngas feed ratio. For comparison, results from a non-promoted MoS2 catalyst are presented. It was found that the CO conversion level for the K-Ni-MoS2 catalyst very much decides the alcohol and hydrocarbon selectivities. Increased CO conversion by means of increased temperature (tested between 330 and 370 degrees C) or decreased space velocity (tested between 2400 and 18,000 ml/(g(cat) h)), both have the same effect on the product distribution with decreased alcohol selectivity and increased hydrocarbon selectivity. Increased CO conversion also leads to a greater long-to-short alcohol chain ratio. This indicates that shorter alcohols are building blocks for longer alcohols and that those alcohols can be converted to hydrocarbons by secondary reactions. At high temperature (370 degrees C) and low space velocity (2400 ml/(g(cat) h)) the selectivity to isobutanol is much greater than previously reported (9%C). The promoted catalyst (K-Ni-MoS2) is also compared to a non-promoted (MoS2) catalyst: the promoted catalyst has quite high alcohol selectivity, while almost only hydrocarbons are produced with the non-promoted catalyst. Another essential difference between the two catalysts is that the paraffin to olefin ratio within the hydrocarbon group is significantly different. For the non-promoted catalyst virtually no olefins are produced, only paraffins, while the promoted catalyst produces approximately equal amounts of C-2-C-6 olefins and paraffins. Indications of olefins being produced by dehydration of alcohols were found. The selectivity to other non-alcohol oxygenates (mostly short esters and aldehydes) is between 5 and 10%C and varies little with space velocity but decreases slightly with increased temperature. Very strong correlation patterns (identical chain growth probability) and identical deviations under certain reaction conditions between aldehyde and alcohol selectivities (for the same carbon chain length) indicate that they derive from the same intermediate. Also olefin selectivity is correlated to alcohol selectivity, but the correlation is not as strong as between aldehydes and alcohols. The selectivity to an ester is correlated to the selectivity to the two corresponding alcohols, in the same way as an ester can be thought of as built from two alcohol chains put together (with some H-2 removed). This means that, e.g. methyl acetate selectivity (C-3) is correlated to the combination of methanol (C-1) and ethanol (C-2) selectivities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: 
Formation of Mo2S3 layers on the surface of graphitic platelets
Abstract:
The powder mixture of thermally exfoliated graphite (TEG) and amorphous molybdenum (VI) sulfide MoS3 has been annealed in vacuum at 723, 1073, and 1273 K. The obtained samples were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy. XRD and Raman spectroscopy detected that the main product of MoS3 annealing is MoS2nanoparticles. TEM images showed the formation of a continuous coating on the surface of TEG platelets at 1273 K and Fourier analysis of the high resolution TEM image revealed that this coating corresponds to the Mo2S3 layers.

Title: 
Effect of Suppression of Grain Growth of Hot Extruded (Bi0.2Sb0.8)(2)Te-3 Thermoelectric Alloys by MoS2 Nanoparticles
Abstract:
Nanostructured bulk materials are regarded as a means of enhancing the performance of thermoelectric (TE) materials and devices. Powder metallurgy has the distinct advantage over conventional synthesis that it can start directly from nanosized particles. However, further processing, for example extrusion, usually requires elevated temperatures, which lead to grain growth. We have found that introduction of semiconductor nanoparticles of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a well-known solid lubricant, suppresses grain growth in bismuth telluride-based alloys, thus improving the extrusion process. Scanning electron microscope images show that adding MoS2particles at concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 wt% to p-type (Bi0.2Sb0.8)(2)Te-3, under otherwise identical extrusion conditions, reduces average grain size by a factor of four. Scherer's formula applied to x-ray diffraction data indicates that average crystallite sizes (similar to 17 nm) of powders are not significantly different from those of alloys extruded with MoS2 (similar to 18 nm), which is in stark contrast with those for conventional alloy (Bi0.2Sb0.8)(2)Te-3 extruded under the same conditions (similar to 80 nm). Harman measurements of TE properties reveal a decrease of the thermal conductivity accompanied by reduction of the room-temperature figure of merit (ZT) from 0.9 to 0.7, because of a lower power factor. Above 370 K, however, the performance of alloys containing MoS2surpasses that of (Bi0.2Sb0.8)(2)Te-3, with reduction of the thermal conductivity which is more significant at temperatures above the cross point of the ZT values.

Title: 
Band alignment of atomic layer deposited high-k Al2O3/multilayer MoS2 interface determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
Abstract:
The energy band alignment between Al2O3/multilayer (ML)-MoS2 was characterized using high-resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Al2O3 was deposited using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) tool. A valence band offset of 4.10 eV and a conduction band offset of 3.41 eV were obtained across the ALD-Al2O3/ML-MoS2 interface. For comparison, the valence band offset and a conduction band offset were also obtained for ALD-SiO2/ML-MoS2 interface. It was found out that ALD-Al2O3/ML-MoS2 interface has a larger conduction band offset, compared to that of ALD-SiO2/ML-MoS2 interface, which indicate ALD-Al2O3 served as the gate dielectric for n-type ML-MoS2 based field effect transistors has advantage over ALD-SiO2 in term of suppressing the gate leakage current.
