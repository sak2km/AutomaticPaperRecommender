Flexural behaviour of textile reinforced concrete composites: experimental and numerical evaluation
Abstract:
Textile reinforced concrete ( TRC) is an innovative high performance composite material which has revealed many promising attributes in various applications but test methods and reliable numerical models need to be established to reduce uncertainty and the need for extensive experimental studies. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the flexural behaviour of carbon textile reinforced TRC slabs both experimentally and numerically along with the characterization of the material and interaction level properties. The experimental results characterizing the bond behaviour were linked to the experimental behaviour of a rectangular TRC slab in bending through numerical analyses. A 2D macro-scale FE-model of the tested TRC slab was developed based on the related experimental input. Comparison of the numerical results to the experiments revealed that the flexural failure was governed by bond, and reasonable agreement was obtained in terms of crack development, deflections, maximum load, and failure mode. Accordingly, the experiments further indicated that the flexural behaviour of TRC slabs is greatly influenced by the bond quality.

Two-Dimensional Material-Based Mode Confinement Engineering in Electro-Optic Modulators
Abstract:
Theability to modulate light using 2-dimensional (2D) materials is fundamentally challenged by their small optical cross-section leading to miniscule modal confinements in diffraction-limited photonics despite intrinsically high electro-optic absorption modulation (EAM) potential given by their strong exciton binding energies. However the inherent polarization anisotropy in 2D materials and device tradeoffs lead to additional requirements with respect to electric field directions and modal confinement. A detailed relationship between modal confinement factor and obtainable modulation strength including definitions on bounding limits are outstanding. Here, we show that the modal confinement factor is a key parameter determining both the modulation strength and the modulator extinction ratio-to-insertion loss metric. We show that the modal confinement and hence the modulation strength of a single-layer modulated 2D material in a plasmonically confined mode is able to improve by more than 10x compared to diffraction-limited modes. Combined with the strong-index modulation of graphene, the modulation strength can be more than 2-orders of magnitude higher compared to Silicon-based EAMs. Furthermore, modal confinement was found to be synergistic with performance optimization via enhanced light-matter-interactions. These results show that there is room for scaling 2D-material EAMs with respect to modal engineering toward realizing synergistic designs leading to high-performance modulators.

In situ synthesis, structure, and properties of bulk nanolaminate YAl3C3 ceramic
Abstract:
Polycrystalline YAl3C3 ceramic was fabricated by an in situ hot-pressing process using YH2, Al, and C powders as starting materials. The crystal structure of YAl3C3 was determined by X-ray diffraction and ab initio calculations to be a hexagonal space group P6(3)/mmc. The lattice parameters are a = b = 3.424 angstrom, c = 17.291 angstrom, and the atomic positions are Y at 2a (0, 0, 0), Al1 at 2d (1/3, 2/3, 3/4), Al2 at 4f (1/3, 2/3, 0.138), Cl at 2c (1/3, 2/3, 1/4), and C2 at 4f (1/3, 2/3, 0.6045). The reaction synthesis path for YAl3C3 was presented. Microstructure observations revealed that YAl3C3 ceramic had plate-like grain morphology. The elastic, mechanical and thermal properties of YAl3C3 were investigated. Most significantly of all, the Young's modulus of YAl3C3 could retain 276 GPa (85% of that at room temperature) at 1500 degrees C, suggesting that YAl3C3 is a promising lightweight high temperature structural material.

Elastic and Inelastic Light-Matter Interactions in 2D Materials
Abstract:
Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides and phosphorene have emerged as brand new photonic materials with huge potential in a variety of optical applications in recent years, due to their unique properties and multiple functions. Owning to the significantly increased surface to volume ratio in the atomic thin layered structure, the interactions between 2D materials with light become remarkably strong in either elastic or inelastic interactions. Most of previous studies were focused on the inelastic interactions between 2D materials with light, namely Raman and photoluminescence properties. However, we found the elastic interactions between them and light are also very attractive. Based on the properties discovered, we demonstrated several optical applications, such as atomically thin optical lenses and gratings. On the other hand, we found the inelastic interactions with light in the 2D limitation affected a lot by the external environment, which could serve as a unique method to control the working status of the optical devices to meet multiple application needs. Several progresses were demonstrated such as control of excitons and trions in few-layer MoS2 via the co-modulations by both temperature and electric field and the defect engineering by oxygen plasma etching to stimulate new photon emission.

Computational Modelling on Heat Transfer Study of Molten Silicon During Multi-crystalline Silicon Growth Process for PV Applications
Abstract:
Multi-crystalline silicon is an important material with advantages of low-production cost and high conversion efficiency for photovoltaic solar cells. Directional solidifi cation has become the main technique for producing mc-Si ingots for solar cell applications. The study is performed in the framework of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in the Boussinesq approximation with convection-conduction equations. The computations are carried out in a two dimensional (2D) axisymmetric model by the finite- element method. The influence of the Reynolds numbers, total heat flux and velocity streamline pattern on the silicon melt was simulated and analyzed for various Rayleigh numbers between 10 to 10 (6) with the help of a numerical technique. The following key findings are presented in this paper. The velocity field value is increased above 0.02(m/s), heat flux value is increased to 10 (4)(W/m (2)), when the Rayleigh number is increased above 1000. Reynolds numbers are also studied in five parallel horizontal cross-sections of the melt silicon region for various Prandtl numbers at a critical Rayleigh number of 1000. Reynolds numbers are varied between 100 and 10 (5) for the Rayleigh numbers between 10 to 10 (6). Meanwhile, the melt has high fluctuation when the Prandtl number is increased above 0.01. The flow is converted from laminar to turbulence at a critical Rayleigh number 1000 and Prandtl number 0.01. These results provide important information for controlling the melt fluctuations during the solidification process which are used to increase the average grain size in growing silicon multicrystals and reduce the dislocation density.

Study of 2D MXene Cr2C material for hydrogen storage using density functional theory
Abstract:
Hydrogen storage capacity of 2D MXene Cr2C has been studied using density functional theory. Possibility to adsorb H-2 molecule on Cr2C surface at various sites has been studied. Among the studied adsorption sites on Cr2C surface, few sites were found suitable for chemisorption and physisorption of H-2 molecules. Few of the studied sites are also found to be suitable for Kubas-type interaction, which is useful for reversible hydrogen storage at ambient conditions. Electronic structure calculations and charge transfer analysis have been done to understand the interactions of adsorbed hydrogen with the Cr2C layer. It has been found that the total hydrogen storage capacity of Cr2C is 7.6 wt.% in which 1.2 wt.% of H is due to the chemisorption, 3.2 wt.% is bonded with Kubas-interaction and remaining 3.2 wt.% is bonded through weak electrostatic interactions (with binding energy of 0.26 eV/H-2 and charge transfer of 0.09 e(-) to H atom from Cr atom). Thus the reversible hydrogen storage capacity at ambient conditions (controlled by hydrogen bonded with energies ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 eV/H-2, in the present case through Kubas and weak electrostatic interactions) is 6.4 wt.% which is greater than the 2017 DoE recommended target value of 5.5 wt.%.

Title: 
Visible-light driven photoelectrochemical immunosensor for insulin detection based on MWCNTs@SnS2@CdS nanocomposites
Abstract:
In this work, a label-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor was developed for ultrasensitive detection of insulin based on MWCNTs@SnS2@CdS nanocomposites. As graphene-like 2D nanomaterial, SnS2 nanosheets loaded on the conducting framework of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were adopted for the construction of immunosensor for the first time, providing a favorable substrate for in-situ growth of CdS nanocrystal that had suitable band structure matching well with SnS2. The well-matched band structure of these two metal sulfides effectively inhibited the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, thus improving the photo-to-current conversion efficiency. Besides, the introduction of MWCNTs facilitated electron transfer across the surface of electrodes, leading to a further increment of photocurrent. The as constructed label-free PEC immunosensor based on MWCNTs@SnS2@CdS nanocomposites exhibited excellent PEC performance for the detection of insulin. The concentrations of insulin could be directly detected based on the decrement of photocurrent that was brought by the increased steric hindrances due to the formation of antigen-antibody immunocomplexes. Under the optimal conditions, the PEC immunosensor had a sensitive response to insulin in a linear range of 0.1 pg mL(-1) to 5 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit of 0.03 pg mL(-1). Meanwhile, good stability and selectivity were achieved as well. The design and fabrication of this PEC immunosensor based on MWCNTs@SnS2@CdS nanocomposites not only provided an ideal platform for the detection of insulin, but also opened up a new avenue for the development of immunosensor for some other biomarkers analysis.

Title: 
Evolution of strain-induced hafnium carbides in a molybdenum base Mo-Hf-C alloy studied by small-angle neutron scattering and complementary methods
Abstract:
The powder metallurgically processed molybdenum base alloy MHC (Mo-Hf-C), with a nominal content of 0.65 at.% Hf and 0.65 at.% C, is of considerable interest for high temperature applications. After uniaxial deformation and subsequent aging of the as-sintered material, plate-like, nm-sized hafnium carbides are formed by heterogeneous nucleation at dislocations. The main focus of this work was to study the evolution of the size distribution of these small hafnium carbides and to gain statistically reliable data from a large volume regarding the morphology and the volume fractions using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments for samples aged at 1600 degrees C for different times. Additionally, complementary methods were used to support the SANS results. Hardness testing, two-stage interrupted compression tests, optical light microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used for further characterization of the aged MHC microstructures and as complementary methods to the SANS measurements. The small-angle neutron scattering investigations revealed anisotropic 2D patterns in relation to the loading direction of the deformed samples which were assigned to not fully compressed pores. It was possible to analyze the thickness distribution of the fine hafnium carbides due to streak formation of the scattering patterns caused by an orientation relationship between face centered cubic hafnium carbides and the body centered cubic molybdenum matrix. The evolution of the microstructure and hardness are in good agreement with the results of the small-angle neutron scattering measurements. The highest hardness was revealed after aging for 1 min at 1600 degrees C exhibiting small hafnium carbides with a mean diameter of similar to 13 nm, a mean plate-thickness of similar to 3 nm and a volume fraction of 0.05 vol%. Although, the volume fraction of these carbides was increasing with progressing aging time the hardness dropped due to recovery, recrystallization as well as increasing particle size.

Title: 
Assessment of key features of lignin from lignocellulosic crops: Stalks and roots of corn, cotton, sugarcane, and tobacco
Abstract:
Lignins from industrial crops could be converted into valuable chemicals in the context of a second generation biorefinery, but prior understanding of their structure is required. This work is focused on the characterization of lignins from stalks and roots of corn, cotton, sugarcane and tobacco. Lignin structure was studied through nitrobenzene oxidation, C-13, P-31, and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Lignins were isolated by mild acidolysis with a maximum degree of contamination of 10% (carbohydrates plus ashes). Interpretation and quantification of NMR spectra provided consistent data about typical units and structures, such as syringyl:guaiacyl:p-hydroxyphenyl (S:G:H), frequency of beta-aryl ether linkages (beta-O-4) and non-condensed structures (NCS), total hydroxyl phenolic groups and their distribution on different non-condensed units type, and the presence of p-coumaric and ferulic acids. In general, roots lignin contains fewer beta-O-4 and lower S/G ratio than the respective stalks, while NCS content does not follow a perceptible trend. In spite of the similarity between corn and sugarcane lignins, radar plots promptly demonstrate higher differences between species than between morphological parts, confirming the lignin specificity of each species. These results are discussed in a comparative approach, highlighting for each material the characteristic features of its lignin. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: 
Structural and vibrational study and superprotonic behavior of the new solid acid: K-0.47(NH4)(0.53)H-2(PO4)(0.52)(AsO4)(0.48)
Abstract:
The new compound K-0.47(NH4)(0.53)H-2(PO4)(0.52)(AsO4)(0.48) crystallizes in the tetragonal system I (4) over bar 2d with lattice parameters a = 7.606(5) angstrom and c = 7.401(5) angstrom. This material has a unit cell volume of 428.16 angstrom(3) and four formula units per cell. The main feature of the structure is the coexistence of two groups with a motive (NH4/K)(+)-H-2(P/As)O-4(-). In this structure, there are two types of hydrogen bonding (O-H center dot center dot center dot O and N-H center dot center dot center dot O) which contributes to their stability. The infrared spectra of K-0.47(NH4)(0.53)H-2(PO4)(0.52)(AsO4)(0.48) recorded at room temperature in the frequency range 4000-400 cm(-1) confirm the presence of two different anions (AsO43- and PO43-) in the same crystal. A calorimetric study of the title compound shows two distinct endothermal peaks which are detected at 248 and 490 K. Samples were examined by impedance and modulus spectroscopy techniques. The first transition (248 K) is attributed to a antiferroelectric-paraelectric type. A high temperature phase transition (490 K) leading to a superionic-protonic phase was found, characterized by an unusual high conductivity. The conductivity relaxation parameters associated with the high-disorder protonic conduction have been determined from analysis of the M ''/M ''(max) spectrum measured in a wide temperature range. Transport properties of this material appear to be due to the proton hopping mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: 
2D and bulk h-MgSe materials from MgmSen (m, n=1-3) clusters: Density functional investigation
Abstract:
An investigation in detail on the structure, electronic and thermodynamic properties for a series of group II and VI Combined hybrid alloy clusters, viz, MgmSen (m,n = 1-3) is performed, under density functional theory (DFT). The geometries of all clusters has been optimized by employing a very popular and reliable exchange-correlation functional, viz, Becke's 3 parameter exchange with Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional (B3LYP). The influence of adding of group II and/or group VI elements on the electronic properties is also addressed in the present work. A sincere effort has been tendered to identify any potential cluster motif from the considered series for utilizing as the building block for prospective metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) materials at the bulk scale. Accordingly, with an achievement of exceptionally stable rhombus shaped and D-2h symmetric Mg2Se2, we have investigated structure and electronic properties of 2D hexagonal magnesium selenide (2D h-MgSe) as well as hexagonal magnesium selenide at bulk scale (bulk h-MgSe). It is evident from the present study that although 2D planar h-MgSe reveals as an insulator with the direct band gap 4.20 eV whereas bulk h-MgSe come out to be a semiconductor material with direct band gap as 1.13 eV. The bulk h-MgSe phase is reported to be an exceptionally stable semiconductor in the magnesium selenide family. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: 
Optimized dispersion of conductive agents for enhancedLi-storage performance of TiO2
Abstract:
Novel TiO2/carbon (TiO2/C) composites have been synthesized by a layer-by-layer deposition method, with electrostatic interaction. The addition of carbon conductive agents enhances the electrochemical performance of TiO2. Carbon for these has been sourced OD nitrogen-doped carbon, 1D carbon nano tubes and 2D graphene. The as-obtained TiO2/C composites show carbon nanotubes and titanium dioxide coaxial nanocables anchored on the graphene. The nitrogen-doped carbon is uniformly dispersed on the nanocables. As anode materials for Li-ion batteries, the TiO2/C composites exhibit excellent rate capability and cycling stability. A capacity of 150 mAh/g is retained at a current density of 4 A/g. The enhanced electrochemical performance may be attributed to the well-dispersed carbon conductive framework, which facilitates charge transfer during the lithium insertion/extraction process.

Title: 
Surface properties of a single perfluoroalkyl group on water surfaces studied by surface potential measurements
Abstract:
A discriminative study of a single perfluoroalkyl (Rf) group from a bulk material is recently recognized to be necessary toward the total understanding of Rf compounds based on a primary chemical structure. The single molecule and the bulk matter have an interrelationship via an intrinsic two-dimensional (2D) aggregation property of an Rf group, which is theorized by the stratified dipole-arrays (SDA) theory. Since an Rf group has dipole moments along many C-F bonds, a single Rf group would possess a hydrophilic-like character on the surface. To reveal the hydration character of a single Rf group, in the present study, surface potential (Delta V) measurements are performed for Langmuir monolayers of Rf-containing compounds. From a comparative study with a monolayer of a normal hydrocarbon compound, the hydration/dehydration dynamics of a lying Rf group on water has first been monitored by Delta V measurements, through which a single Rf group has been revealed to have a unique "dipole-inter active" character, which enables the Rf group interacted with the water 'surface.' In addition, the SDA theory proves to be useful to predict the 2D aggregation property across the phase transition temperature of 19 degrees C by use of the AV measurements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title: 
Proteomic profile of mouse fibroblasts exposed to pure magnesium extract
Abstract:
Magnesium and its alloys gain wide attention as degradable biomaterials. In order to reveal the molecular mechanism of the influence of biodegradable magnesium on cells, proteomics analysis was performed in this work. After mouse fibroblasts (L929) were cultured with or without Mg degradation products (Mg-extract) for 8, 24, and 48 h, changes inprotein expression profiles were obtained using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) coupled two dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC MS/MS). A total of 867 proteins were identified (relying on at least two peptides). Compared to the control group, 205, 282, and 217 regulated proteins were identified at 8, 24, and 48 h, respectively. 65 common proteins were up or down-regulated within all the three time points, which were involved in various physiological and metabolic activities. Consistent with viability, proliferation, and cell cycle analysis, stimulated energy metabolism as well as protein synthesis pathways were discussed, indicating a possible effect of Mg-extract on L929 proliferation. Furthermore, endocytosis and focal adhesion processes were also discussed. This proteomics study uncovers early cellular mechanisms triggered by Mg degradation products and highlights the cytocompatibility of biodegradable metallic materials for biomedical applications such as stents or orthopaedic implants.

Title: 
Fission yields and cross section uncertainty propagation in Boltzmann/Bateman coupled problems: Global and local parameters analysis with a focus on MTR
Abstract:
In a previous paper, a method was investigated to calculate sensitivity coefficients in coupled Boltzmann/Bateman problem for nuclear data (ND) uncertainties propagation on the reactivity. Different methodologies were discussed and applied on an actual example of multigroup cross section uncertainty problem for a 2D Material Testing Reactor (MTR) benchmark. It was shown that differences between methods arose from correlations between input parameters, as far as the method enables to take them into account. Those methods, unlike Monte Carlo (MC) sampling for uncertainty propagation and quantification (UQ), allow obtaining sensitivity coefficients, as well as correlations values between nuclear data, during the depletion calculation for the parameters of interest. This work is here extended to local parameters such as power factors and isotopic concentrations. It also includes fission yield (FY) uncertainty propagation, on both reactivity and power factors. Furthermore, it introduces a new methodology enabling to decorrelate direct and transmutation terms for local quantities: a Monte-Carlo method using built samples from a multidimensional Gaussian law is used to extend the previous studies, and propagate fission yield uncertainties from the CEA's COMAC covariance file. It is shown that, for power factors, the most impacting ND are the scattering reactions, principally coming from Al-27 and (bounded hydrogen in) H2O. The overall effect is a reduction of the propagated uncertainties throughout the cycle thanks to negatively correlated terms. For fission yield (FY), the results show that neither reactivity nor local power factors are strongly affected by uncertainties. However, they have a non-negligible impact on some isotopic concentrations, and can lead to biases on some burnup indicators. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent progress in 2D or 3D N-doped graphene synthesis and the characterizations, properties, and modulations of N species
Abstract:
Nitrogen (N)-doped graphene (N-substituted or nitrogenated graphene) (NG) has become a new class of graphene material due to its modified properties such as the tunable work function, n-type semiconductivity, increasing biocompatibility, and, in particular, the synergistic function with various functional materials. However, the preparation of NG by a simple and effective method is still lacking. The modification of NG mainly depends on the N species and the N content. Thus, we focus on the recent progress in preparing methods of 2D NG and the respective key modulating parameters to modulate the N species and the N content. Furthermore, many effective charactering techniques are covered to accurately analyze the properties of N species, and the distribution and topography of N atoms. Also, we review the effect of N species on graphene, especially, the optical and electronic properties. Since constructing 3D structure is considered a promising strategy to prevent the restacking of 2D NG, the summary for preparing 3D NG is made on the basis of methodology of 2D NG. In a word, this review provides a reference for preparing 2D or 3D NG, modulating and characterizing N species, which are greatly contributed to the NG application.

Title: 
Flow control through the use of heterogeneous porous media: "Smart" passive thermo-insulating materials
Abstract:
In this paper, the concept of "smart" thermally insulating materials intelligently adapted to specific engineering configurations is established and extensively validated. Thermal insulation is achieved by local suppression of the momentum of the confined natural convection flow in the most critical regions, as determined by a linear stability analysis of the flow in the presence of implants of heterogeneous porous media. The implants are modelled by unconnected packed beds of equi-sized cylinders. The concept is based on a mesoscale approach in which the non-slip boundary conditions in the vicinity of the packed beds are explicitly imposed by utilizing the immersed boundary (IB) method. Two different patterns for the "smart" porous media are established, and their thermal insulation properties are quantified. It is shown that the optimized patterns for implants of heterogeneous porous media, occupying approximately only 5% of the overall volume, can drastically delay the steady-unsteady transition of the 2D natural convection flow in a square differentially heated cavity with thermally perfectly conducting horizontal walls. In addition, it is demonstrated that the implants facilitate a consistent decrease in the heat flux through a cubic differentially heated cavity with all being thermally perfectly conducting lateral walls.

Title: 
Fractionation of wheat straw Dioxane lignin reveals molar mass dependent structural differences
Abstract:
Dioxane lignin was isolated from ball-milled wheat straw by neutral dioxane-water extraction and subsequently molar-mass-fractionated by flash chromatography in dimethylformamide. The eluted lignin containing material was pooled into six distinct molar mass fractions that were in turn structurally characterized in detail by wet chemistry and NMR spectroscopy methods. Fractions of higher molar mass were found to be enriched in p-hydroxyphenyl units and contained more p-hydroxycinnamic acid units. They were found mainly associated with linear arabinoxylan, while in low-molar-mass fractions additional glucan contributions were found. Fractions of lower molar mass consisted of relatively more guaiacyl units and showed exclusive association with tricin units. One distinct lignin fraction with lower lignin content supposedly contained high ratios of arabinoxylan chains esterified by ferulic acid and cross-linked via ferulic acid dimerization, structures which were considered to represent lignin nucleation sites. High abundance of dibenzodioxocin type structures in this fraction indicated that they could be involved in cross-linking hemicelluloses networks with lignin moieties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Self-assembled flower-like NiFe2O4 decorated on 2D graphene nanosheets composite and their excellent electrochemical performance as anode materials for LIBs
Abstract:
Flower-like NiFe2O4 decorated on 2D graphene nanosheets composite and spherical NiFe2O4 decorated on 2D graphene nanosheets composite have been synthesized through an easy method including one-pot hydrothermal route and one-pot heat treatment, respectively. In the well-designed 3D dimensional system, 2D graphene nanosheets work as conductive matrix to support the flower-like NiFe2O4 and spherical NiFe2O4. The structure integrates the advantage of graphene nanosheets to preserve the electrode activity and integrity, improving the electrochemical performance. Lithium storage properties of the two kind of composites are compared as anode materials. The results presented that flower-like NiFe2O4/graphene composite shows better electrochemical performance and cycling stability. The first discharge capacity is 2632.6 mA h/g at a high current density of 100 mA/g. After 50 cycles, the reversible capacity is 606.2 mA h/g and the coulomb efficiency reaches at 98.86%. With the excellent electrochemical properties, flower-like NiFe2O4 decorated on 2D graphene nanosheets could be a kind of promising potential candidate anode materials for LIBs. This research offers possibility to improve the lithium ion storage capacity of transition metal oxides through advisablely controlling the architecture and composition of anode materials.

Epitaxial growth of Bi2Te3 topological insulator thin films by temperature-gradient induced physical vapor deposition (PVD)
Abstract:
We report the growth of a high-quality Bi2Te3 thin film on an Al2O3 substrate using physical vapor deposition. Using a carefully selected temperature gradient between two separately controllable heaters inside a furnace, an unstrained Bi2Te3 thin film with c-axis orientation and domains bonded by van der Waals epitaxy is formed, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The stoichiometry of the film determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that the film has only slight surface oxidation and few contaminants, and the estimated ratio of the atomic densities of bismuth and tellurium is 1.49. A relatively low carrier concentration of 4.83 x 10(18) cm(-3) and electron mobility of 192.4 cm(2)/Vs at 3 K allow clear observation of the weak anti-localization effect. Using a traditional two-dimensional (2D) localization analysis with the original Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka equation, we find clear evidence for the existence of topological surface states, and the temperature dependence of the phase coherence length exhibits 2D material behavior. Pronounced linear magnetoresistance at medium and high fields, which shows the interplay between three characteristic lengths, is also analyzed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
