Facile assembly of Bi2O3/Bi2S3/MoS2 n-p heterojunction with layered n-Bi2O3 and p-MoS2 for enhanced photocatalytic water oxidation and pollutant degradation
Abstract:
As an important half reaction in solar-driven water splitting, it is still a challenging issue to develop low-cost and high efficient photocatalysts for water oxidation process. In this study, we reported a facile strategy for controllable synthesis of three-component Bi2O3/Bi2S3/MoS2 n-p heterojunction based on the formation of the intermediate Bi2S3 by coupling Bi2O3 and MoS2. The Bi2S3 was easily formed due to the strong interaction between Bi3+ and S2- ions with the assistance of the hydrothermal treatment. As a result, the prepared Bi2O3/Bi2S3/MoS2 nanocomposite exhibits enhanced ability of photocatalytic water oxidation (529.1 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) (cat)), which is 1.5 and 12.5 times higher than that of pure Bi2O3 and MoS2, respectively, under simulated solar light irradiation. Furthermore, the photoelectrochemical results reveal that the charge transportation feature and the donor density were apparently enhanced after the introduction of highly conductive layered MoS2, which indicates the enhancement of the photo-response and the improvement of charge separation efficiency.

Graphene Q-Switched Vectorial Fiber Laser With Switchable Polarized Output
Abstract:
We report a graphene Q-switched ytterbium-doped fiber laser with switchable cylindrical vector beam output. The 6-8 layers CVD-grown graphene films were transferred to the target substrate by an ultrasonic processing method, and its saturation intensity and modulation depth are measured to be about 0.61 MW/cm(2) and 13.2% at 1072 nm by the Z-scan technique. We used a nanograting spatially variant waveplate as an intracavity polarization controlling element to convert pulsed Gaussian beam to radially or azimuthally polarized beam in the fiber laser cavity. Stable Q-switching operation can be achieved with the output power up to 253 mW and pulse energy 7.73 mu J at the maximum incident pump power. The polarization extinction ratio of radially and azimuthally polarized beam is 97.4% and 96.9%, respectively. The experimental results suggest that the graphene can act as a potential nonlinear optical material to modulate pulsed fiber lasers with spatially inhomogeneous polarizations.

Elastic and Inelastic Light-Matter Interactions in 2D Materials
Abstract:
Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides and phosphorene have emerged as brand new photonic materials with huge potential in a variety of optical applications in recent years, due to their unique properties and multiple functions. Owning to the significantly increased surface to volume ratio in the atomic thin layered structure, the interactions between 2D materials with light become remarkably strong in either elastic or inelastic interactions. Most of previous studies were focused on the inelastic interactions between 2D materials with light, namely Raman and photoluminescence properties. However, we found the elastic interactions between them and light are also very attractive. Based on the properties discovered, we demonstrated several optical applications, such as atomically thin optical lenses and gratings. On the other hand, we found the inelastic interactions with light in the 2D limitation affected a lot by the external environment, which could serve as a unique method to control the working status of the optical devices to meet multiple application needs. Several progresses were demonstrated such as control of excitons and trions in few-layer MoS2 via the co-modulations by both temperature and electric field and the defect engineering by oxygen plasma etching to stimulate new photon emission.

Femtosecond Passively Er-Doped Mode-Locked Fiber Laser With WS2 Solution Saturable Absorber
Abstract:
This study presents the femtosecond fundamental and harmonic mode-locked Er-doped fiber laser with WS2 solution saturable absorber (SSA). The SA is fabricated based on a D-shaped fiber (DF) embedded in WS2 nanosheets solution. Such WS2 solution has virtues of good antioxidant capacity, excellent scattering resistance, high heat dissipation, and high damage threshold. This kind of SA shows a modulation depth of 11%, a saturable intensity I-sat of 5 MW/cm(2), and nonsaturable loss of 18%. By employing DF-WS2 SSA, a stable mode-locked fiber laser is achieved with repetition rate of 10.2 MHz and pulse duration of 660 fs. At the pump power of 350 mW, 460.7-MHz repetition rate harmonic mode-locking (HML) operation is also obtained, which corresponds to 45th harmonics of the fundamental cavity repetition rate. The pulse duration is 710 fs and signal-to-noise ratio is 66 dB, showing the excellent performance in HML fiber laser with SA. The results indicate that DF-WS2 solution can work as a potential SA for ultrafast nonlinear optics.

Self-Starting Mode-Locking by Fiber-Integrated WS2 Saturable Absorber Mirror
Abstract:
We reported on a novel configuration of fiber-integrated tungsten disulfide (WS2) saturable absorber mirror (SAM). The SAM, fabricated by deposition of WS2 layer and Au film over fiber end based on the magnetron sputtering technique, was compact, reliable, and suitable for mass production. The modulation depth, saturation intensity, and reflectivity weremeasured to be 4.48%, 138 MW/cm(2), and 98%, respectively. By employing this SAM, self-starting mode locking could be achieved in a wideband range in linear erbium-doped fiber lasers. The output pulsewidth was around 1 ns and the signal-to-noise ratio was of 61.1 dB in the RF spectrum. The proposed WS2-SAM opens a promising way for practical fiber-integrated mode-locker for pulsed fiber laser technology.

Abstract:
In this work, we demonstrated the field emission properties of few layer molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) nanosheets synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Structural investigation indicates the as-synthesized MoS2 layers were two dimensional few layer nanosheets with a sharp atomic edges. The field emission properties of the MoS2 nanosheets were investigated and the results indicate that the MoS2 nanosheets had an excellent field emission performance with turn on field of 1.0 V/mu m, threshold field of 2.1 V/mu m, and a field enhancement factor of 9880. Furthermore, the emission current shows the stability over 2 h of continuous operation. The as-synthesized MoS2 few layer nanosheets hold potential for application in next-generation field emission devices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: 
Mussel inspired preparation of MoS2 based polymer nanocomposites: The case of polyPEGMA
Abstract:
In this work, we report a facile strategy to prepare PEGylated MoS2 nanosheets through the combination of mussel inspired chemistry and Michael addition reaction. The MoS2 nanosheets were obtained from lithium intercalation and exfoliation method. Meanwhile, the amino-contained poly((polyethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (PPEGMA) were obtained via chain transfer free radical polymerization using cysteamine hydrochloride as the chain transfer agents and PEGMA as the monomer. To introduce PPEGMA on MoS2 nanosheets, polydopamine (PDA) thin films were first coated on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets through self polymerization of dopamine as the ad-layers, which can react with amino-terminated PPEGMA through Michael addition reaction. The structure, morphology and chemical compositions of MoS2 nanosheets and MoS2-PDA-PPEGMA have been characterized by various characterization techniques. The results demonstrated that the amino-terminated PPEGMA can be successfully immobilized on MoS2 nanosheets via PDA thin films as the ad-layers. More importantly, the strategy described in this work could also be utilized for surface immobilization of various polymers on many other materials and surfaces because of the universal adhesion of PDA and the good monomer applicability of chain transfer free radical polymerization. Taken together, we developed a facile and versatile method to fabricate multifunctional MoS2 based polymer nanocomposites with designable properties and applications via combination of mussel inspired and chain transfer free radical polymerization. The resultant composites are expected to be potentially used for drug delivery and photothermal cancer treatment. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Title: 
Electrocatalytic determination of nitrite based on straw cellulose/molybdenum sulfide nanocomposite
Abstract:
Cellulose is the most abundant, renewable, biodegradable natural polymer resource on earth, which can be a good substrate for catalysis. In this work, straw cellulose has been oxidized through 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical (TEMPO)-mediated oxidation, and then a TEMPO oxidized straw cellulose/molybdenum sulfide (TOSC-MoS2) composite has been synthesized via a hydrothermal method. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirm that TOSC and MoS2 have successfully composited. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show the TOSC as a carbon nanotube-like structure and edged MoS2 grows on the TOSC substrate. The TOSC-MoS2 modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) is used as a simple and non enzymatic electrochemical sensor. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) result shows TOSC-MoS2 has excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of nitrite. The amperometric response result indicates the TOSC-MoS2 modified GCE can be used to determine nitrite concentration in wide linear ranges of 6.0-3140 and 3140-4200 mu M with a detection limit of 2.0 mu M. The proposed sensor has good anti-interference property. Real sample analysis and the electrocatalytic mechanism have also been presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: 
Assessing C-3-C-4 alcohol synthesis pathways over a MgAl oxide supported K/MOS2 catalyst via C-13(2)-ethanol and C-13(2)-ethylene co-feeds
Abstract:
Mechanisms of C-3-C-4 alcohol synthesis from syngas are elucidated over a Mg/Al mixed metal oxide (MMO) supported K/MoS2 catalyst via C-13(2)-ethanol and C-13(2)-ethylene co-feeds. K/bulk-MoS2 is used as a control catalyst to provide insight into the role of K/MoS2 and K/MoS2-MMO sites on higher alcohol formation pathways. Analysis of the products via C-13 NMR show preferential enrichment of terminal carbons in C-3-C-4 alcohols with both co-feeds, suggesting that CO insertion is the primary higher alcohol synthesis pathway, and that olefin carbonylation proceeds through the same pathway as alcohol formation. The observation of C-13(4)-1-butanol species during the CO hydrogenation reactions with C-13(2)-ethanol co-feeds provides conclusive evidence of ethanol self-coupling to 1-butanol as a secondary pathway. Additionally, acetate species are shown to be formed via an acyl precursor reacting with an alkoxy anion. Hydrogenation of an acetyl species (CH3CO*) to an ethoxy intermediate (C2H5O*) is shown to be largely irreversible under the reaction conditions employed, as no preferential enrichment is observed for the acetyl group in acetate species. Propionate species are shown to be formed via esterification of propionate with the corresponding alcohol, while isobutyl alcohol formation observed over both the K/bulk-MoS2 and the MMO supported catalysts occurs via methanol coupling with 1-propanol or 1-propanol derived species.

Title: 
Synthesis of MoS2 nanoparticles using MoO3 nanobelts as precursor via a PVP-assisted hydrothermal method
Abstract:
The synthesis of MoS2 nanoparticles from MoO3 with a certain morphology through a surfactant-assisted hydrothermal process is described in this paper. MoO3, which has a nanobelt morphology with a width of 100-500 nm and a length from one to several micrometers, is used as the precursor, and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) is used as the surfactant. The morphology of the resulting MoS2 nanomaterial has been characterized by the field-emission scanning electron microscope, which shows that the obtained nanoparticles have diameters ranging from 50 to 100 nm with rough surfaces. Additionally, the composition and crystallinity as well as the phase information of the produced nanoparticles have been characterized by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer and X-ray diffraction. Specifically, in this process, the presence of PVP plays a crucial role for the successful fabrication of the nanoparticle morphology, which may be due to the formation of PVP micelles leading to an oriented aggregation of MoS2 nuclei. In addition, comparative experiments have been conducted and the possible reaction mechanism is proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: 
Delivering dispersion-managed soliton and Q-switched pulse in fiber laser based on graphene and nonlinear optical loop mirror
Abstract:
We propose and experimentally demonstrate a bidirectional erbium-doped fiber laser delivering dispersion -managed soliton (DMS) and Q-switched pulse based on a graphene-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and nonlinear optical loop mirror (NOLM) saturable absorbers (SAs). In proposed structure, the DMS is achieved in clockwise (CW) direction and Q-switched pulse is obtained in counter-clockwise (CCW) direction. By properly adjusting the intracavity attenuators (ATT) and polarizer controllers (PCs), DMS in the CW direction and Q-switched pulse in the CCW direction can be obtained, respectively or simultaneously. The DMS with full width at half maximum (FWHM) of similar to 480 fs, signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 60 dB and repetition frequency about 3.907 MHz is obtained. The Q-switched pulse is established at a pump power of 180 mW with a repetition rate of similar to 43.5 kHz and FWHM of similar to 8.18 mu s. When the pump power is increased to 700 mW, Q-switched pulse with a repetition rate of similar to 107.1 kHz and FWHM of similar to 2.15 mu s is generated. When the two type pulses are formed simultaneously, the maximum repetition rate of Q-switched pulse is 55.8 kHz and minimum FWHM is 2.81 mu s, the DMS can be formed by properly adjusting PC and ATT in this case. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that Q-switched pulse and DMS have been acquired respectively or simultaneously in a fiber laser. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: 
Facile one-pot synthesis of CoS2-MoS2/CNTs as efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction
Abstract:
Ternary hybrid cobalt disulfide-molybdenum disulfides supported on carbon nanotubes (CoS2MoS2/CNTs) electrocatalysts have been prepared via a simple hydrothermal method. CNTs as support may provide good conductivity and low the agglomeration of layered MoS2 structure. CoS2 with intrinsic metallic conductivity may enhance the activity of the ternary hybrid electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). X-ray diffraction (XRD) data confirm the formation of ternary hybrid nanocomposites composed of CNTs, CoS2 and amorphous MoS2. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that strong combination between MoS2, CNTs and regular orthohexagonal CoS2 has been obtained. The dispersion of each component is good and no obvious agglomeration can be observed. It is found that compared with CoS2/CNTs and MoS2/CNTs, the ternary CoS2-MoS2/CNTs have the better activity for HER with a low onset potential of 70 mV (vs. RHE) and a small Talel slope of 67 mV dec(-1), and are extremely stable after 1000 cycles. In addition, the optimal doping ratio of Co to Mo is 2:1, which have better HER activity. It is proved that the introduction of carbon materials and Co atoms could improve the performances of MoS2-based electrocatalysts for HER. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: 
Solid-contact K+-selective electrode based on three-dimensional molybdenum sulfide nanoflowers as ion-to-electron transducer
Abstract:
Three-dimensional (3D) molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) nanoflowers have been synthesized via a novel hydrothermal method and applied as ion-to-electron transducer for solid-contact ion-selective electrodes (SC-ISEs). The morphology and elemental composition of the prepared nanomaterials have been characterized. The performance of the developed K+-SC-ISE has been demonstrated by determining K+ in solution with a polymeric membrane containing valinomycin as the ionophore. A Nernstian slope of 55.8 mV/decade with a detection limit of 10(-5.5) M can be obtained. Using the 3D flowerlike MoS2 as solid contact, the fabricated K+-SC-ISE exhibits a smaller impedance and more stable potential response than the coated-wire electrode. In addition, the novel SC-ISE behaves well in the water layer test and shows good resistance to interferences from light, O-2 and CO2. It is believed that the 3D MoS2 nanoflowers can be a good alternative as solid contact in SC-ISEs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: 
PEG-mediated hydrothermal synthesis of hierarchical microspheres of MoS2 nanosheets and their potential for lubrication application
Abstract:
Lamellar-structured nanomaterials are gaining large interest for tribological applications owing to their remarkable mechanical and low shearing properties. Herein, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated hierarchical microspheres of MoS2 nanosheets are synthesized by a facile and single-step hydrothermal reduction of ammonium molybdate in the presence of thiourea. The PEG functions as a soft templating material and provides hierarchical microspheres of MoS2 nanosheets. Detailed chemical and microstructural features of hierarchical microspheres of MoS2 nanosheets are probed by FTIR, XPS, Raman, XRD, TGA, FESEM, and HRTEM analyses. Each nanosheet of MoS2 microspheres is composed of limited number (10-20) of atomic-thick lamellae as deduced from HRTEM images. The MoS2 microspheres, as additive provide significantly improved lubrication properties for steel tribo-pair by reducing the friction (similar to 21%) and the wear (42%) compared to that of fully formulated 10W40 lubricant. The elemental mapping of worn surfaces revealed the deposition of MoS2 nanosheets on the contact interfaces. The improved lubrication properties are attributed to collective effect of deposition of delaminated MoS2 lamellae on the contact interfaces, low shearing and high mechanical strength of MoS2 nanosheets.

Facile synthesis route for MoS2-polyvinylpyrrolidone aerogels
Abstract:
Three-dimensional (3D) aerogels with low density, high porosity and large surface area have attracted increasing attention and exhibit numerous applications. However, the material types of aerogels are still very limited. Herein, we report a facile synthesis route to prepare MoS2-polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) aerogels via direct frozen-drying from primitive solution with PVP, which plays a key role to obtain aerogels. The good wettability both on water and oil of PVP makes it easily cover on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets, which promotes the sheets connection with each other. The density of the obtained MoS2-PVP aerogels can be tuned from 9.2 to 33.8 mg/cm(3) via simply changing the concentrations of the precursors. Importantly, our current approach has been successfully applied to prepare other 2D or 1D material-PVP aerogels, taking boron nitride-PVP and, carbon nanotubes-PVP aerogels as examples.

Electronic and magnetic properties of 1T-HfS2 by doping transition-metal atoms
Abstract:
We explored the electronic and magnetic properties of 1T-HfS2 doped by transition metal (TM) atom using the first-principles calculation. We doped the transition metal atoms from the IIIB to VIB groups in nonmagnetic 1T-HfS2. Numerical results show that the pristine 1T-HfS2 is a semiconductor with indirect gaps of 1.250 eV. Magnetism can be observed for V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Cu doping. The polarized charges mainly arise from the localized 3d electrons of the TM atom. The strong p-d hybridization was found between the 3d orbitals of TM and 3p orbitals of S. The substituted 1T-HfS2 can be a metal, semiconductor or half-metal. Analysis of the band structure and magnetic properties indicates that TM-doped HfS2 (TM=V, Fe, Cu) are promising systems to explore two-dimensional diluted magnetic semiconductors. The formation energy calculations also indicate that it is energetically favorable and relatively easier to incorporate transition metal atom into the HfS2 under S-rich experimental conditions. In contrast, V doped HfS2 has relatively wide half-metallic gap and low formation energy. So V-doped 1T-HfS2 is ideal for spin injection, which is important for application in semiconductor spintronics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fracture behaviors of pre-cracked monolayer molybdenum disulfide: A molecular dynamics study
Abstract:
The fracture strength and crack propagation of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) sheets with various pre-existing cracks are investigated using molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). The uniaxial tensions of pre-cracked monolayer MoS2 sheets with different crack tips, different locations of crack, different crack lengths and angled cracks are simulated and studied. The results show that the configuration of crack tip can influence significantly the fracture behaviors of monolayer MoS2 sheets while the location of crack does not influence the fracture strength. With the increase of crack length, the fracture strength of monolayer MoS2 sheets reduces almost linearly, and the fracture of monolayer MoS2 sheets is transformed from almost brittle to ductile. By making comparison between the MDS results and the predictions of continuum fracture mechanics theories, including Inglis' model, Griffith's model with and without finite size effect, it is found that MDS results agree well with the predictions of Griffith's model with finite size effect, differ from the predictions of Inglis' model and Griffith's model without finite size effect. Finally, the MDS results of monolayer MoS2 sheets with different angled crack are also analyzed based on the continuum fracture mechanics model.

CoSe2 nanoparticles embedded defective carbon nanotubes derived from MOFs as efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction
Abstract:
Development of electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with low overpotential and robust stability remained as one of the most serious challenges for energy conversion. In this work, CoSe2 nanoparticles embedded in defective carbon nanotubes (CoSe2@DC) was synthesized by a carbonization-oxidation-selenylation procedure of Co-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The pre-oxidation treatment was a crucial step in introducing an increasing number of defects into carbon nanotubes, which promoted the reaction between Co@carbon and selenium and led to the enhanced HER performance. The as-prepared CoSe2@DC exhibited excellent HER catalytic reactivity with a low onset potential of -40 mV vs. RHE, a small Tafel slope of 82 mV dec(-1) as well as a high current density with robust catalytic stability in 0.5 M H2SO4. This work may provide a generic methodology for rational design and fabrication of the partially encased core-shell structure derived from MOFs as efficient HER electrocatalysts.

MoS2 yolk-shell microspheres with a hierarchical porous structure for efficient hydrogen evolution
Abstract:
Yolk-shell architectures have attracted extensive attention owing to their unique structure and infusive applications. MoS2 is regarded as one of the most promising catalytic materials for hydrogen evolution by the splitting of water. In this work, a simple self-template solvothermal approach is developed for the synthesis of novel MoS2 yolk-shell microspheres with a hierarchical porous structure by reacting MoO2 microspheres with L-cysteine. A dissolutionrecrystallization formation mechanism is proposed for the MoS2 yolk-shell microspheres. Owing to structural superiority, the new material architecture exhibits improved photoelectrochemical properties, including efficient hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic activities, a high photocurrent density, a small overpotential, and a low charge-transfer resistance.

Stabilizing Active Edge Sites in Semicrystalline Molybdenum Sulfide by Anchorage on Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanotubes for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
Abstract:
Finding an abundant and cost-effective electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial for a global production of hydrogen from water electrolysis. This work reports an exceptionally large surface area hybrid catalyst electrode comprising semicrystalline molybdenum sulfide (MoS2+x) catalyst attached on a substrate based on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs), which are directly grown on carbon fiber paper (CP). It is shown here that nitrogen-doping of the carbon nanotubes improves the anchoring of MoS2+x catalyst compared to undoped carbon nanotubes and concurrently stabilizes a semicrystalline structure of MoS2+x with a high exposure of active sites for HER. The well-connected constituents of the hybrid catalyst are shown to facilitate electron transport and as a result of the good attributes, the MoS2+x/N-CNT/CP electrode exhibits an onset potential of -135 mV for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4, a Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1), and high stability at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2).

Investigation on the Stability of WSe2-PVA Saturable Absorber in an all PM Q-Switched Fiber Laser
Abstract:
In this paper, we demonstrate an all polarization maintaining (PM) Q-switched erbium-doped fiber laser based on tungsten diselenide-polyvinyl alcohol (WSe2-PVA) saturable absorber (SA) and investigated the stability of WSe2-PVA SA in the laser. The all PM cavity isolated the environmental perturbation on the cavity birefringence so that the evolution of material properties of WSe2-PVA SA during the Q-switched operation can be investigated based on the laser output. It is found that when heat accumulation reached a certain level in WSe2-PVA SA, PVA in SA would first melt and perturb the transmission of SA; then, WSe2 in SA would be quickly damaged, resulting in a permanent increase of the SA loss. This work will benefit the research on obtaining a long-term stable all PM Q-switched lasers based on 2-D material saturable absorber.

Improved Tribological Performance of Amorphous Carbon (a-C) Coating by ZrO2 Nanoparticles
Abstract:
Nanomaterials, such as Graphene, h-BN nanoparticles and MoS2 nanotubes, have shown their ability in improving the tribological performance of amorphous carbon (a-C) coatings. In the current study, the effectiveness of ZrO2 nanoparticles (ZrO2-NPs) in lubricating the self-mated nonhydrogenated a-C contacts was investigated in boundary lubrication regime. The results showed that 13% less friction and 50% less wear compared to the base oil were achieved by employing ZrO2-NPs in the base oil in self-mated a-C contacts. Via analyzing the ZrO2-NPs and the worn a-C surface after tests, it was found that the improved lubrication by ZrO2-NPs was based on "polishing effects", which is a new phenomenon observed between a-C and nanoparticles. Under the "polishing effect", micro-plateaus with extremely smooth surface and uniform height were produced on the analyzed a-C surface. The resulting topography of the a-C coating is suitable for ZrO2-NPs to act as nano-bearings between rubbing surfaces. Especially, the ZrO2-NPs exhibited excellent mechanical and chemical stability, even under the severe service condition, suggesting that the combination of nonhydrogenated a-C coating with ZrO2-NPs is an effective, long lasting and environment-friendly lubrication solution.

Soft Interface Fracture Transfer in Nanoscale MoS2
Abstract:
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoflakes, nanotubes, and nanoparticles are used as solid lubricants and oil additives. We investigate the formation of transfer layers due to fracture during sliding on commercially available MoS2 nanoflakes. The sliding and fracture properties were observed in high-frame-rate videos and high-resolution images captured using in situ transmission electron microscopy. The orientation of the flakes and the adhesion to the surface and to the contact asperity determined the weakest interface, which subsequently determined the fracture transfer layer. The fracture continued until both surface and counter surface lubricant layers were a single sheet. The fractured material created a transfer layer or wear particles. We did not observe the proposed "deck-of-cards'' sliding, where the sliding is distributed between all the layers of a MoS2 flake. Instead, we captured video of an entire flake fracturing at a weak point in the MoS2 sheets, a "weakest link'' soft interface fracture model. The soft interface fracture transfer (SIFT) model is not specific to MoS2-layered nanoflakes, and we argue it is a general mechanism in the formation of tribolayers.

Stable all-fiber Er-doped Q-switched laser with a WS2/fluorine mica (FM) saturable absorber
Abstract:
This paper presents a stable all-fiber Q-switched Er-doped fiber (EDF) laser with WS2/fluorine mica (FM) as the saturable absorber (SA). The SA device is obtained by depositing WS2 nanosheet layers onto a 20 mu m thick one-layer FM substrate using a thermal decomposition method. The modulation depth (MD) of the SA is 8.22% and the non-saturable loss (NL) is 16.38%. By inserting the SA into the EDF laser cavity, stable Q-switched operation is achieved with a central wavelength of 1567 nm. The repetition rate can be tuned from 20.98 kHz to 33.74 kHz and the pulse duration can be adjusted from 8.3 mu s to 6.98 mu s by increasing the pump power. The maximum output power and the maximum pulse energy are measured to be 2.07 mW and 61.4 nJ, respectively. The experimental results evidently show that the WS2/FM can be regarded as a high-performance SA for fiber lasers.

WS2 nanoparticles anti-wear and friction reducing properties on rough surfaces in the presence of ZDDP additive
Abstract:
The effect of WS2 nanoparticles used as lubricant additives in PAO alone and in presence of ZDDP additive on the lubrication of rough surfaces has been studied at 100 degrees C in the boundary lubrication regime. The results showed that the use of nanoparticles in PAO base oil reduces both wear and friction by around 70% compared to PAO. The surface analyzes revealed that a tribofilm is formed on the steel surface and that nanoparticles can be trapped in the steel grooves. These trapped nanoparticles could provide proper lubrication of the contact zone in case of nanoparticle starvation. The presence of ZDDP additive in the lubricant enhances the friction reducing and anti-wear effect of the nanoparticles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: 
Chiral vectors-tunable electronic property of MoS2 nanotubes
Abstract:
It has been demonstrated that the mechanical and electronic properties of materials change significantly when the external dimension are confined to the nanoscale. Consequently, one-dimensional (1D) transition -metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) nanotubes (NTs), obtained from scrolling 2D TMDC, have attracted much attentions because of their intriguing properties and the chirality plays a key role in affecting the electronic properties. Taking the amount of speculations on the mechanism and the increasing needs for better device design and performance control, understanding the effect of chirality on the electronic properties is timely and relevant. Here, MoS2 NTs are comprehensively studied by first-principles calculations. The results show that the armchair (6 <= ch <= 14) exhibits the indirect-band-gap and zigzag (10 <= ch <= 20) with direct-band-gap. Moreover, the carrier mobility is enhanced with the decrease of radial length, in accord with the smaller effective mass of hole and electron for both types NTs. Finally, the formation energy showed that the smaller the radial diameters is, the harder the NTs is to form. Moreover, the similarity of lattice parameters and formation energy implies a potential possibility of transition between two types of NTs with low index chiral vectors, such as ANT(6,6)/ZNT(10,0).

Title: 
Facile synthesis of molybdenum disulfide/nitrogen-doped graphene composites for enhanced electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution and electrochemical lithium storage
Abstract:
A facile one-pot hydrothermal route with the mediation of ionic liquid (IL, [BMIM]BF4) is presented to synthesize MoS2/nitrogen-doped graphene (MoS2/NG-IL) composites. It is found that as-prepared MoS2/NG-IL composites exhibit that the de-layered MoS2 sheets with more exposed edge sites and defects are well anchored on the N-doped graphene. Due to the synergism between de-layered MoS2 a nd N-doped graphene, MoS2/NG-IL composites exhibit better electrochemical performances for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and reversible lithium storage in comparison with MoS2. Especially, when 1.0 mL of IL is added in hydrothermal solution, the obtained MoS2/NG-IL10 displays very high electrocatalytic activity for HER with a low onset overpotential of 80 mV and a small Tafel slope of 48.0 mV/dec in 0.5 M H2SO4. As anode of lithium ion battery, MoS2/NG-IL10 delivers a reversible capacity as high as 1169 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and enhanced rate capability of 782 mAh g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1). After 800 cycles, a reversible capacity of about 800 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) can be retained, indicating its excellent cyclic stability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract:
The present work demonstrates the self-organized formation of anodic molybdenum oxide nanotube arrays. The amorphous tubes can be crystallized to MoO2 or MoO3 and be converted fully or partially into molybdenum sulfide. Vertically aligned MoOx/MoS2 nanotubes can be formed when, under optimized conditions, defined MoS2 sheets form in a layer by layer arrangement that provide a high density of reactive stacking misalignments (defects). These core-shell nanotube arrays consist of a conductive suboxide core and a functional high defect density MoS2 coating. Such structures are highly promising for applications in electrocatalysis (hydrogen evolution) or ion insertion devices.

MoS2/Ag nanohybrid: A novel matrix with synergistic effect for small molecule drugs analysis by negative-ion matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
Abstract:
This paper reports a facile synthesis of molybdenum disulfide nanosheets/silver nanoparticles (MoS2/Ag) hybrid and its use as an effective matrix in negative ion matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The nanohybrid exerts a strong synergistic effect, leading to high performance detection of small molecule analytes including amino acids, peptides, fatty acids and drugs. The enhancement of laser desorption/ionization (LDI) efficiency is largely attributed to the high surface roughness and large surface area for analyte adsorption, better dispersibility, increased thermal conductivity and enhanced UV energy absorption as compared to pure MoS2. Moreover, both Ag nanoparticles and the edge of the MoS2 layers function as deprotonation sites for proton capture, facilitating the charging process in negative ion mode and promoting formation of negative ions. As a result, the MoS2/Ag nanohybrid proves to be a highly attractive matrix in MALDI-TOF MS, with desired features such as high desorption/ionization efficiency, low fragmentation interference, high salt tolerance, and no sweet-spots for mass signal. These characteristic properties allowed for simultaneous analysis of eight different drugs and quantification of acetylsalicylic acid in the spiked human serum. This work demonstrates for the first time the fabrication and application of a novel MoS2/Ag hybrid, and provides a new platform for use in the rapid and high throughput analysis of small molecules by mass spectrometry.

WS2 nanotube formation by sulphurization: Effect of precursor tungsten film thickness and stress
Abstract:
Transition metal dichalcogenides can exhibit as 2-dimensional layers, 1-dimensional nanotubes or 0-dimensional quantum dot structures. In general, dichalcogenide nanotubes are grown under stringent conditions, using high growth temperatures with tedious processes. Here, we report the controlled formation of tungsten disulphide (WS2) nanostructures by manipulating the precursor film thickness, followed by a direct sulphurization process. WS2 nanotubes were formed by ultra-thin tungsten precursor films, while particle-like WS2 were obtained from thicker tungsten films under identical sulphurization conditions. To elucidate the origin of WS2 nanostructure formation, micron-sized tungsten film tracks were prepared, and such patterned films were found to suppress the growth of WS2 nano tubes. We attribute the suppression of nanotube formation to the relieving of film stress in patterned precursor films. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Influence of curvature strain and Van der Waals force on the inter-layer vibration mode of WS2 nanotubes: A confocal micro-Raman spectroscopic study
Abstract:
Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) nanostructures including nanotubes and monolayers have attracted great interests in materials science, chemistry to condensed matter physics. We present an interesting study of the vibration modes in multi-walled tungsten sulfide (WS2) nanotubes prepared via sulfurizing tungsten oxide (WO3) nanowires which are investigated by confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy. The inter-layer vibration mode of WS2 nanotubes, A(1g), is found to be sensitive to the diameter and curvature strain, while the in-plane vibration mode, E-12g,E- is not. A(1g) mode frequency shows a redshift by 2.5 cm(-1) for the multi-layered nanotubes with small outer-diameters, which is an outcome of the competition between the Van der Waals force stiffening and the curvature strain softening. We also show that the Raman peak intensity ratio is significantly different between the 1-2 wall layered nanotubes and monolayer flat sheets.

Novel Pliable Electrodes for Flexible Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices: Recent Progress and Challenges
Abstract:
With wearable electronics rapidly coming into fashion, research into flexible energy storage devices and in particular, pliable electrodes, is attracting a lot of attention. Pliable electrodes are usually fabricated by intercalating an active material in a flexible matrix with superior mechano-electrical properties, and can be grouped either as substrate-supported or free-standing. Depending on their mode of deformation the electrodes can be labeled as bendable, compressible or stretchable. Recent progress and challenges in the design and fabrication of pliable electrodes for constructing flexible lithium ion batteries and flexible supercapacitors are highlighted. 2 pliable core-shell structure electrodes fabricated from: a) carbon nanotube sponge embedded with MoS2 nanoparticles and b) electrospun polyethylene terephthalate fibers impregnated with graphene nanoplatelets are also presented.

Raman spectroscopy of transition metal dichalcogenides
Abstract:
Raman spectroscopy of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is reviewed based on our recent theoretical and experimental works. First, we discuss the semi-classical and quantum mechanical description for the polarization dependence of Raman spectra of TMDs in which the optical dipole transition matrix elements as a function of laser excitation energy are important for understanding the polarization dependence of the Raman intensity and Raman tensor. Overviewing the symmetry of TMDs, we discuss the dependence of the Raman spectra of TMDs on layer thickness, polarization, laser energy and the structural phase. Furthermore, we discuss the Raman spectra of twisted bilayer and heterostructures of TMDs. Finally, we give our perspectives on the Raman spectroscopy of TMDs.

A Facile Strategy for the Preparation of MoS3 and its Application as a Negative Electrode for Supercapacitors
Abstract:
Owing to their graphene-like structure and available oxidation valence states, transition metal sulfides are promising candidates for supercapacitors. Herein, we report the application of MoS3 as a new negative electrode for supercapacitors. MoS3 was fabricated by the facile thermal decomposition of a (NH4)(2)MoS4 precursor. For comparison, samples of MoS3&MoS2 and MoS2 were also synthesized by using the same method. Moreover, this is the first report of the application of MoS3 as a negative electrode for supercapacitors. MoS3 displayed a high specific capacitance of 455.6Fg(-1) at a current density of 0.5Ag(-1). The capacitance retention of the MoS3 electrode was 92% after 1500cycles, and even 71% after 5000cycles. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor assembly of MoS3 as the negative electrode demonstrated a high energy density at a high potential of 2.0V in aqueous electrolyte. These notable results show that MoS3 has significant potential in energy-storage devices.

Title: 
Fabrication of photostable ternary CdS/MoS2/MWCNTs hybrid photocatalysts with enhanced H-2 generation activity
Abstract:
This article reports the synthesis and photocatalytic H-2-generation of pristine and CdS-based hybrid, photocatalysts. Acid-treated-multi-walled carbon nanotubes (a-MWCNTs) and colloids of the exfoliated two-dimensional MoS2 nanosheets were used for the preparation of binary CdS/a-MWCNTs and ternary CdS/MoS2/a-MWCNTs nanocomposites. Controlled exfoliation of as-synthesized bulk marigold flower-like MoS2 to few-layer MoS2 nanosheets shows a strong absorption and photoluminescence, indicating an indirect to direct bandgap transition. The visible-light photocatalytic H-2-evolution performance of the ternary nanocomposites was superior to that of the binary and pure photocatalysts. Transient photocurrent results revealed that the ternary nanocomposite exhibits a maximum photocurrent density of 11.12 mA/cm(2), which is 12 times higher than that of pristine CdS. This enhanced H-2-generation performance and photocurrent response is attributed to the CdS/MoS2 heterojunction, Which increases charge-separation efficiency of the composite. Furthermore, the presence of a-MWCNTs, as a co-catalyst/support, accounts for this excellent performance involving electron transfer from photoexcited CdS to MOS2 edges through a-MWCNTs; this transfer results in enhanced charge separation. This enhanced charge-separation efficiency and photostability was demonstrated using a suitable mechanism, which was evident from photocurrent measurements and photoluminescence data. In such ternary hybrids, metal co-catalysts showed H-2-evolution activity with the following order: Pd > Ni > Au > Ag > Cu. This work further highlights the role of MoS2/CNTs p-n junction embedded in CdS which serves as a promising heterojunction that promoted hydrogen production. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title: 
Facile preparation of graphene-like and expanded molybdenum disulfide/graphene via a polyquaternium-assisted method and their electrochemical Na-storage performance
Abstract:
A facile polyquaternium-assisted hydrothermal and postannealing strategy was successfully developed to fabricate graphene-like MoS2/graphene hybrid (GL-MoS2/GR) by anchoring few-layered and expanded MoS2 nanosheets onto flexible and highly-conductive graphene. The resultant hybrid was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Raman spectroscopy. Experimental results indicated that the MoS2 nanosheets with few-layered features (2-5 layers) and expanded interlayer space were well dipersed and anchored on the graphene to form hybrid. As a consequence, the obtained GL-MoS2/GR electrode exhibited superior electrochemical sodium-storage performances such as high reversible specific capacity, excellent cyclic stability and significantly enhanced rate capability. The prominent electrochemical performance could be attributed to the robust hybrid architectures composed of few-layered and expanded MoS2 nanosheets and conductive graphene as well as the resultant positive synergistic effect between them.

Title: 
Self-aligned graphene oxide nanoribbon stack with gradient bandgap for visible-light photodetection
Abstract:
In this work, we demonstrate multi-bandgap photodetectors with an inherently lattice-matched structure by the natural stacking of graphene oxide nanoribbons. The stacked multilayer graphene oxide nanoribbons are produced by unzipping multi-walled carbon nanotubes. A correlation study between image inspection and photoelectrical characterization of stacked graphene oxide nanoribbon devices is performed in specific chips. Transmission electron microscopy images reveal the presence of a multilayer graphene oxide nanoribbon with gradually increasing widths, suggesting that multilayer graphene oxide nanoribbons with decreasing bandgaps could innately act as low-pass photon energy filters and serve to increase the spectral absorption window in these photodetectors. Photoelectrical measurements show visible-light spectrum absorption, which suggests that the various energy bandgaps of the multi-layer graphene oxide nanoribbons contribute toward the increased bandwidth in photon absorption. Furthermore, photo-responsivities on the order of 10 A/W with a stable photo-switching behavior as well as fast response times are observed. The response times range from 2 ms in the membrane devices down to a few hundred of ps in the suspended devices due to elimination of the substrate effect. Based upon this correlation study, we believe that this stacked multilayer graphene oxide nanoribbon structure with gradually varying widths is a promising candidate towards the development of novel high performance photodetectors and optoelectronics.

Liquid Phase Exfoliated MoS2 Nanosheets Percolated with Carbon Nanotubes for High Volumetric/Areal Capacity Sodium-Ion Batteries
Abstract:
The search for high-capacity, low-cost electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries is a significant challenge in energy research. Among the many potential candidates, layered compounds such as MoS2 have attracted increasing attention. However, such materials have not yet fulfilled their true potential. Here, we show that networks of liquid phase exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets, reinforced with 20 wt % single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), can be formed into sodium-ion battery electrodes with large gravimetric, volumetric, and areal capacity. The MoS2/SWNT composite films are highly porous, electrically conductive, and mechanically robust due to its percolating carbon nanotube network. When directly employed as the working electrode, they exhibit a specific capacity of >400 mAh/g and volumetric capacity of similar to 650 mAh/cm(3). Their mechanical stability allows them to be processed into free-standing films with tunable thickness up to similar to 100 mu m corresponding to an areal loading of 15 mg/cm(2). Their high electrical conductivity allows the high volumetric capacity to be retained, even at high thickness, resulting in state-of-the-art areal capacities of >4.0 mAh/cm(2). Such values are competitive with their lithium-ion counterparts.

A glassy carbon electrode modified with MoS2 nanosheets and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) for simultaneous electrochemical detection of ascorbic acid, dopamine and uric acid
Abstract:
We describe a chemical exfoliation method for the preparation of MoS2 nanosheets. The nanosheets were incorporated into poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) by electrodeposition on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to form a nanocomposite. The modified GCE is shown to enable simultaneous determination of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA) and uric acid (UA). Due to the synergistic effect of MoS2 and PEDOT, this electrode displays better properties in terms of electrocatalytic oxidation of AA, DA and UA than pure PEDOT, which is illustrated by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Under optimum conditions and at pH 7.4, the respective sensitivities and best working potentials are as follows: AA: 1.20 Aa (TM) mM(-1)a (TM) m(-2), 30 mV; DA: 36.40 Aa (TM) mM(-1)a (TM) m(-2), 210 mV; UA: 105.17 Aa (TM) mM(-1)a (TM) m(-2), 350 mV. The calculated detection limits for AA, DA and UA are 5.83 mu M, 0.52 mu M and 0.95 mu M, respectively. The modified electrode was applied to the detection of the three species in human urine samples and gave satisfactory results.

Chiral vectors-tunable electronic property of MoS2 nanotubes
Abstract:
It has been demonstrated that the mechanical and electronic properties of materials change significantly when the external dimension are confined to the nanoscale. Consequently, one-dimensional (1D) transition -metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) nanotubes (NTs), obtained from scrolling two-dimensional (2D) TMDC, have attracted much attentions because of their intriguing properties wherein the chirality of NTs plays a key role in affecting the electronic properties. Taking into the amount of speculations on the mechanism and the increasing needs for better device design and performance control, understanding the effect of chirality on the electronic properties is timely and relevant. Here, MoS2 NTs are comprehensively studied by first-principles calculations. The results show that the armchair (6 <= ch <= 14) exhibits the indirect-band-gap and zigzag (10 <= ch <= 20) with direct-band-gap. Moreover, the carrier mobility is enhanced with the decrease of radial length, in accord with the smaller effective mass of hole and electron for both types NTs. Finally, the formation energy showed that the smaller the radial diameters is, the harder the NTs is to form. Moreover, the similarity of lattice parameters and formation energy implies a potential possibility of transition between two types of NTs with low index chiral vectors, such as ANT (6,6)/ZNT(10,0).

Title: 
Ultrafast Li-storage of MoS2 nanosheets grown on metal-organic framework-derived microporous nitrogen-doped carbon dodecahedrons
Abstract:
The nanocomposites of MoS2 nanosheets and microporous nitrogen-doped carbon dodecahedron (MNCD) are prepared through the pyrolysis of metal-organic framework (MOF) and subsequent growth of MoS2. The porous and active surface of MNCDs enables uniform growth of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets. When the MNCD@MoS2 composite is used as the anode material of Li-ion batteries, a reversible capacity of 915 mAh g(-1) can be obtained even at the extremely high current density of 10 A g(-1). The ultrafast charge/discharge ability of MNCD@MoS2 can be attributed to its unique core-shell structure with the inner MNCDs serving as the reservoir of Li-ions and transport media of electrons.

Nanoporous two-dimensional MoS2 membranes for fast saline solution purification
Abstract:
Finding a membrane with both high permeability and high salt rejection is very important for saline solution purification. Here, we report the performance of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) membranes with nanoscale pores for saline solution purification via all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. It was found that the nanoporous two-dimensional MoS2 membrane can impede salt ions, while allowing highly efficient permeation of water molecules. By engineering the appropriate sizes of the nanopores within two-dimensional MoS2 membranes, their water permeability can be tens of times as high as that of conventional reverse osmosis membranes, while still maintaining a high salt rejection rate. These remarkable water permeability and salt rejection properties of the nanoporous monolayer MoS2 membranes are attributed to the formation of single chain hydrogen bonds, which link the water molecules within the nanopores and those at the immediate exteriors of the nanopores, causing significant reduction in the resistance of water molecules passing through the nanopores, which are small enough for any salt ions to pass through. Therefore such nanoporous monolayer MoS2 membranes have great potential for saline solution purification.

Mesoporous MoO3-x Material as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reactions
Abstract:
A unique approach for the synthesis of nonstoichiometric, mesoporous molybdenum oxide (MoO3-x) with nanosized crystalline walls by using a soft template (PEO-b-PS) synthesis method is introduced. The as-synthesized mesoporous MoO3-x is very active and stable (durability > 12 h) for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under both acidic and alkaline conditions. The intrinsic MoO3 serves as an HER electrocatalyst without the assistance of carbon materials, noble metals, or MoS2 materials. The results from transmission electron microscopy and N-2 sorption techniques show that the as-synthesized mesoporous MoO3-x has large accessible pores (20-40 nm), which are able to facilitate mass transport and charge transfer during HER. In terms of X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed oxidation, and diffusive reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy, the mesoporous MoO3-x exhibits mixed oxidation states (Mo5+, Mo6+) and an oxygen-deficient structure. The as-synthesized MoO3-x only requires a low overpotential (approximate to 0.14 V) to achieve a 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 0.1 M KOH and the Tafel slope is as low as 56 mV dec(-1). Density functional theory calculations demonstrate a change of electronic structure and the possible reaction pathway of HER. Oxygen vacancies and mesoporosity serve as key factors for excellent performance.

Composition and Interface Engineering of Alloyed MoS2xSe2(1-x) Nanotubes for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Activity
Abstract:
Hierarchical MoS2xSe2(1-x) nanotubes assembled from several-layered nanosheets featuring tunable chalcogen compositions, expanded interlayer spacing and carbon modification, are synthesized for enhanced electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The chalcogen compositions of the MoS2xSe2(1-x) nanotubes are controllable by adjusting the selenization temperature and duration while the expanded (002) interlayer spacing varies from 0.98 to 0.68 nm. It is found that the MoS2xSe2(1-x) (x = 0.54) nanotubes with expanded interlayer spacing of 0.98 nm exhibit the highest electrocatalytic HER activity with a low onset potential of 101 mV and a Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1). The improved electrocatalytic performance is attributed to the chalcogen composition tuning and the interlayer distance expansion to achieve benefitting hydrogen adsorption energy. The present work suggests a potential way to design advanced HER electrocatalysts through modulating their compositions and interlayer distances.

Title: 
Remarkably improving performance of carbon black-filled rubber composites by incorporating MoS2 nanoplatelets
Abstract:
The filler dispersion and network in rubber composites are critical factors in determining the properties of the composites. In this study, we incorporate a graphene-like layered material, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), to partly substitute carbon black (CB) in styrene butadiene rubber/CB composites, and primarily focus on the filler dispersion and network as well as their effects on the mechanical properties of the composites. With the addition of MoS2, the dispersion of CB is greatly improved and the CB agglomerates are suppressed. When MoS2 substitution content is less than 1 phr, the modulus and strength of the composites are slightly decreased due to the release of trapped rubber from CB agglomerates, while the dynamic mechanical properties are significantly improved. At higher MoS2 substitution loading, MoS2 and CB form a denser and continuous hybrid filler network, which shows remarkable synergistic effects in improving the both static and dynamic mechanical properties of the composites. For example, the addition of 3 phr MoS2 leads to a 50% increase in the tensile modulus and 10 degrees C decrease in the heat build-up of the composite. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ammonia intercalated flower-like MoS2 nanosheet film as electrocatalyst for high efficient and stable hydrogen evolution
Abstract:
Ammonia intercalated flower-like MoS2 electrocatalyst film assembled by vertical orientated ultrathin nanosheet on graphite sheethas been successfully synthesized using one-step hydrothermal method. In this strategy, ammonia can effectively insert into the parallel plane of the MoS2 nanosheets, leading to the expansion of lattice and phase transfer from 2H to 1T, generating more active unsaturated sulfur atoms. The flower-like ammoniated MoS2 electrocatalysts with more active sites and large surface area exhibited excellent HER activity with a small Tafel slope and low onset overpotential, resulting a great enhancement in hydrogen evolution. The high efficient activity and recyclable utilization, as well as large-scale, indicate that it is a very promising electrocatalyst to replace Pt in industry application.

Chemical Wet Etching of an Optical Fiber Using a Hydrogen Fluoride-Free Solution for a Saturable Absorber Based on the Evanescent Field Interaction
Abstract:
We propose a chemical wet etching technique that does not make use of toxic Hydrofluoric solution to produce cladding-etched optical fiber intended for use as a platform for a fiberized saturable absorber. The wet etching technique is based on the use of a mixed solution of NH4F and (NH4)(2)SO4, which is not toxic, and a small, specially-devised etching cradle to achieve precise control of the etched fiber length. A fiberized saturable absorber was implemented by depositing the graphene oxide particles on top of the residual cladding for our cladding-etched fiber by using the drop & dry method. The saturable absorber was incorporated into an erbium-doped fiber ring cavity to test its suitability as a mode-locker with a modulation depth larger than 4.3%. Femtosecond pulses with a temporal width of similar to 615 fs were readily obtained at a repetition rate of similar to 17.09 MHz. The saturable absorption and laser performance of our saturable absorber were compared to those of an absorber on a core-etched fiber platform prepared through the formation of microdroplets of HF and surface tension-driven flow, as in [57].

Polyaniline-modified 3D-flower-like molybdenum disulfide composite for efficient adsorption/photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI)
Abstract:
Polyaniline (PANI) was modified onto 3D flower-like molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) to prepare a novel organic-inorganic hybrid material, PANI@MoS2. PANI@MoS2 was characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. The results indicate that PANI was modified onto MoS2. PANI@MoS2 was applied as an adsorbent to remove Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions, and the adsorption isotherms fit well to the Langmuir model; the maximum removal capacity of Cr(VI) by PANI@MoS2 was 526.3 and 623.2 mg/g at pH 3.0 and 1.5, respectively. PANI@MoS2 exhibited an enhanced removal capacity of Cr(VI) in comparison with bare MoS2 and other adsorbents. The adsorption of Cr(VI) on PANI@MoS2 might be attributed to the complexation between the amine and imine groups on the surface of PANI@MoS2 with Cr(VI). This study implies that the hybrid material PANI@MoS2 is a potential adsorbent for Cr(VI) removal from large volumes of aqueous solutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
