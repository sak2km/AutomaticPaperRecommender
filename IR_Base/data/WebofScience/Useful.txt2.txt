Large-area MoS2 grown using H2S as the sulphur source
Abstract:
We report on the growth of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) using H2S as a gas-phase sulfur precursor that allows controlling the domain growth direction of domains in both vertical (perpendicular to the substrate plane) and horizontal (within the substrate plane), depending on the H2S:H-2 ratio in the reaction gas mixture and temperature at which they are introduced during growth. Optical and atomic force microscopy measurements on horizontal MoS2 demonstrate the formation of monolayer triangular-shape domains that merge into a continuous film. Scanning transmission electron microscopy of monolayer MoS2 shows a regular atomic structure with a hexagonal symmetry. Raman and photoluminescence spectra confirm the monolayer thickness of the material. Field-effect transistors fabricated on MoS2 domains that are transferred onto Si/SiO2 substrates show a mobility similar to previously reported exfoliated and chemical vapor deposition-grown materials.

Morphology engineering of monolayer MoS2 by adjusting chemical environment during growth
Abstract:
The precise control of the morphology of monolayer MoS2 is of particular importance for their potential applications and device performance. In this work, we present an experimental method to study the shape evolution of the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown MoS2 flakes. We observed that the morphology of monolayer MoS2 flakes transformed from truncated triangular shape to triangular shape by increasing the stoichiometric ratio of S:Mo, and consequently tailor the optical properties of MoS2 flakes. The results suggest the possibility to engineer the morphology of monolayer MoS2 by adjusting the chemical environment during growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Growth mechanism of largescale MoS2 monolayer by sulfurization of MoO3 film
Abstract:
Monolayer two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS2 with broken inversion symmetry possesses two degenerate yet inequivalent valleys that can be selectively excited by circularly polarized light. This unique property renders interesting valley physics. The ability to manipulate valley degrees of freedom with light or external field makes them attractive for optoelectronic and spintronic applications. There is great demand for large area monolayer (ML) TMDCs for certain measurements and device applications. Recent reports on large area ML TDMCs focus on chemical vapor deposition growth. In this work, we report a facile approach to grow largescale continuous ML MoS2 nearly free of overgrowth and voids, by sulfurizing evaporated molybdenum trioxide ultrathin films. Photo conductivity scales with device sizes up to 4.5 mm, suggesting excellent film uniformity. The growth mechanism is found to be vaporization, diffusion, sulfurization and lateral growth, all at local micrometer scale. Our approach provides a new pathway for large-area ML TMDC growth and lithography-free device fabrication.

Large-area few-layer MoS2 deposited by sputtering
Abstract:
Direct magnetron sputtering of transition metal dichalcogenide targets is proposed as a new approach for depositing large-area two-dimensional layered materials. Bilayer to few-layer MoS2 deposited by magnetron sputtering followed by post-deposition annealing shows superior area scalability over 20 cm(2) and layer-by-layer controllability. High crystallinity of layered MoS2 was confirmed by Raman, photo-luminescence, and transmission electron microscopy analysis. The sputtering temperature and annealing ambience were found to play an important role in the film quality. The top-gate field-effect transistor by using the layered MoS2 channel shows typical n-type characteristics with a current on/off ratio of approximately 10(4). The relatively low mobility is attributed to the small grain size of 0.1-1 mu m with a trap charge density in grain boundaries of the order of 10(13) cm(-2).

Substrate control for large area continuous films of monolayer MoS2 by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition
Abstract:
Growing monolayer MoS2 films that are continuous with large domain sizes by chemical vapor deposition is one of the major challenges in 2D materials research at the moment. Here, we explore how atmospheric pressure CVD can be used to grow centimeter scale continuous films of monolayer MoS2 films directly on Si substrates with an oxide layer whilst also obtaining large domain sizes exceeding 20 mu m within the films. This is achieved by orientating the growth substrate in a vertical position to improve the uniformity of precursor feed-stock compared to horizontally orientated growth substrates. This leads to continuous films of monolayer MoS2 over a significantly larger area without the need for low-pressure vacuum systems or volatile precursors. This provides important insights into novel approaches for maximizing domain sizes within MoS2 films, with concomitant large area uniform coverage.

Strongly enhanced photoluminescence in nanostructured monolayer MoS2 by chemical vapor deposition
Abstract:
Two-dimensional (2D) layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has become a very promising candidate semiconducting material for future optoelectronic devices, owing to its unique properties. However, monolayer MoS2 is still a weak photon emitter, compared with other direct band gap semiconductors, which requires extra techniques or complicated steps to enhance its photon emission efficiency. Here, we demonstrated that nanostructured monolayer MoS2, produced by one-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth, shows highly enhanced PL emission. The effective enhancement factor could be up to similar to 43. Our results open the door to manipulating the optical properties of future devices by using nanostructured 2D monolayers.

Photosensitivity Study of Metal-Semiconductor-Metal Photodetector Based on Chemical Vapor Deposited Monolayer MoS2
Abstract:
Monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is an emerging two-dimensional material beyond graphene, which could potentially be applicable to lightweight, flexible optoelectronic device. In this study, we have demonstrated a planar metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors based on large area monolayer MoS2. The monolayer MoS2 was grown via chemical vapor deposition method, showing excellent structural and optical properties. The current voltage measurement was characterized at various monochromatic lights in visible spectrum. The device exhibited good responsivity similar to 7.7 mANV for wavelength of similar to 470 nm, which is relatively comparative to mechanical exfoliated monolayer MoS2 based photodetectors. Additionally, the photoresponse measurement showed that the rise/fall time was about 1/0.7 s.

Towards large area and continuous MoS2 atomic layers via vapor-phase growth: thermal vapor sulfurization
Abstract:
We report on the effects of substrate, starting material, and temperature on the growth of MoS2 atomic layers by thermal vapor sulfurization in a tube-furnace system. With Mo as the starting material, atomic layers of MoS2 flakes are obtained on sapphire substrates while a bell-shaped MoS2 layer, sandwiched by amorphous SiO2, is obtained on native-SiO2/Si substrates under the same sulfurization conditions. An anomalous thickness-dependent Raman shift (A(1g)) of the MoS2 atomic layers is observed in Mo-sulfurizations on sapphire substrates, which can be attributed to the competition between the effects of thickness and the surface/interface. Both effects vary with the sulfurizing temperatures for a certain initial Mo thickness. The anomalous frequency trend of A(1g) is missing when using MoO3 instead of Mo as the starting material. In this case, the lateral growth of MoS2 on sapphire is also largely improved. Furthermore, the area density of the resultant MoS2 atomic layers is significantly increased by increasing the deposition temperature of the starting MoO3 to 700 degrees C; the adjacent ultrathin MoS2 grains coalesce in one or other direction, forming connected chains in wafer scale. The thickness of the so-obtained MoS2 is generally controlled by the thickness of the starting material; however, the structural and morphological properties of MoS2 grains, towards large area and continuous atomic layers, are strongly dependent on the temperature of the initial material deposition, and on the temperature of sulfurization, because of the competition between surface mobility and atom evaporation.

Large-Scale Synthesis of a Uniform Film of Bilayer MoS2 on Graphene for 2D Heterostructure Phototransistors
Abstract:
The large-scale synthesis of atomically thin, layered MoS2/graphene heterostructures is of great interest in optoelectronic devices because of their unique properties. Herein, we present a scalable synthesis method to prepare centimeter scale, continuous, and uniform films of bilayer MoS2 using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition. This growth process was utilized to assemble a heterostructure by growing large-scale uniform films of bilayer MoS2 on graphene (G-MoS2/graphene). Atomic force microscopy, Raman spectra, and transmission electron microscopy characterization demonstrated that the large-scale bilayer MoS2 film on graphene exhibited good thickness uniformity and a polycrystalline nature. A centimeter-scale phototransistor prepared using the G-MoS2/graphene heterostructure exhibited a high responsivity of 32 mA/W with good cycling stability; this value is 1 order of magnitude higher than that of transferred MoS2 on graphene (2.5 mA/W). This feature results from efficient charge transfer at the interface enabled by intimate contact between the grown bilayer MoS2 (G-MoS2) and graphene. The ability to integrate multilayer materials into atomically thin heterostructures paves the way for fabricating multifunctional devices by controlling their layer structure.

All Chemical Vapor Deposition Growth of MoS2:h-BN Vertical van der Waals Heterostructures
Abstract:
Vertical van der Waals heterostructures are formed when different 2D crystals are stacked on top of each other. Improved optical properties arise in semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) 20 materials, such as MoS2, when they are stacked onto the insulating 20 hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Most work to date has required mechanical exfoliation of at least one of the TMDs or h-BN materials to form these semiconductor:insulator structures. Here, we report a direct all-CVD process for the fabrication of high-quality monolayer MoS2:h-BN vertical heterostructured films with isolated MoS2 domains distributed across 1 cm. This is enabled by the use of few-layer h-BN films that are more robust against decomposition than monolayer h-BN during the MoS2 growth process. The MoS2domains exhibit different growth dynamics on the h-BN surfaces compared to bare SiO2, confirming that there is strong interaction between the MoS2 and underlying h-BN. Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies of CVD-grown MoS2 are compared to transferred MoS2 on both types of substrates, and our results show directly grown MoS2 on h-BN films have smaller lattice strain, lower doping level, cleaner and sharper interfaces, and high-quality interlayer contact.

Large-Area Epitaxial Mono layer MoS2
Abstract:
Two-dimensional semiconductors such as MoS2 are an emerging material family with wide-ranging potential applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and energy harvesting. Large-area growth methods are needed to open the way to applications. Control over lattice orientation during growth remains a challenge. This is needed to minimize or even avoid the formation of grain boundaries, detrimental to electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of MoS2 and other 2D semiconductors. Here, we report on the growth of high-quality monolayer MoS2 with control over lattice orientation. We show that the monolayer film is composed of coalescing single islands with limited numbers of lattice orientation due to an epitaxial growth mechanism. Optical absorbance spectra acquired over large areas show significant absorbance in the high-energy part of the spectrum, indicating that MoS2 could also be interesting for harvesting this region of the solar spectrum and fabrication of UV-sensitive photodetectors. Even though the interaction between the growth substrate andMoS2 is strong enough to induce lattice alignment via van der Waals interaction, we can easily transfer the grown material and fabricate devices. Local potential mapping along channels in field-effect transistors shows that the single-crystal MoS2 grains in our film are well connected, with interfaces that do not degrade the electrical conductivity. This is also confirmed by the relatively large and length-independent mobility in devices with a channel length reaching 80 mu m.

MoS2 FET Fabrication and Modeling for Large-Scale Flexible Electronics
Abstract:
We present a state-of-the-art fabrication technology and physics-based model for molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) field effect transistors (FETs) to realize large-scale circuits. Uniform and large area chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of monolayer MoS2 was achieved by using perylene-3,4,9, 10-tetracarboxylic acid tetrapotassium salt (PTAS) seeding. Then, a gate first process results in enhancement mode FETs and also reduces performance variation and enables better process control. In addition, a Verilog-A compact model precisely predicts the performance of the fabricated MoS2 FETs and eases the large-scale integrated design. By using this technology, a switched capacitor DC-DC converter is implemented, and the measurement of the converter shows good agreement with the simulations.

Chemical Vapor Deposition of MoS2 films
Abstract:
The MoS2 films were deposited on the titanium nitride (TiN) substrate using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The molybdenum hexacarbonyl (Mo(CO)(6)) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a precursor and reaction gas, respectively. Preliminary analysis of Mo(CO)(6) which decomposed about 200 degree Celsius under low pressure condition was carried out using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The MoS2 films deposited under the various substrate temperature, chamber pressure, and flow rate were analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Raman spectroscopy. The result of Raman spectroscopy shows the bulk MoS2 Raman shift for samples deposited on the specific conditions.

High mobility top gated field-effect transistors and integrated circuits based on chemical vapor deposition-derived monolayer MoS2
Abstract:
Monolayer MoS2 with large area and high quality are grown using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on Si/SiO2 substrate, the triangle grain size is about 50 mu m, and top-gated field-effect transistors (FETs) were fabricated using atomic layer deposition (ALD) grown HfO2 at low temperature as high-k gate insulator. The transistors present typical n-type field-effect properties, especially with high carrier mobility up to about 36.4 cm(2)/Vs, which is the highest value of mobility of top gated transistors based on CVD-derived single layerMoS2. Two kinds of methods were used to extract mobility from the measured properties of FETs, and the consistent results indicated the retrieved mobility was reliable. In addition an inverter circuit with gain larger than 1 was constructed based on the n-type FETs.

IMPROVEMENT IN MOBILITY AND CONDUCTIVITY OF FEW-LAYER MoS2 FILMS
Abstract:
We present a study of the influence of annealing and doping on the electrical properties of few-layer (FL) MoS2 films on Si and quartz substrates deposited using a self-designed metal sulfide chemical vapor deposition (MSCVD) system. FL MoS2 slices obtained through MSCVD, in the size range of 50-200 nm, were found to be uniformly scattered on the substrates. The conductivity and mobility of these films are greatly enhanced after annealing at 650-850 degrees C. The largest mobility measured for pure MoS2 on quartz substrate is 6.4 x 10(3) cm(2) /Vs, almost two orders of magnitude larger than that of bulk MoS2 (500 cm(2) /Vs). We deduce that the superior charge carrier mobility in our sample is mainly attributed to reduced phonon scattering because of a lower carrier density (10(10) - 10(11) cm(-2)) compared to previously documented values (10(12) - 10(13) cm(-2)). Additionally, the conductivity and carrier concentration of FL MoS2 films were enhanced by about two orders of magnitude compared to those of the as-grown films doped with Cu, Na and Ag ions but not doped with B ions. The films doped with Na and Ag exhibit characteristic p-type conductivity, while those doped with Cu and B exhibit n-type conductivity. Moreover, the MoS2/Si heterojunction exhibited good rectification characteristics and excellent conductivity, indicating that the FL MoS2 films will find many applications in high-efficiency nanodevices.

Large-Area Growth of Uniform Single-Layer MoS2 Thin Films by Chemical Vapor Deposition
Abstract:
We report the largest-size thin films of uniform single-layer MoS2 on sapphire substrates grown by chemical vapor deposition based on the reaction of gaseous MoO3 and S evaporated from solid sources. The as-grown thin films of single-layer MoS2 were continuous and uniform in thickness for more than 4 cm without the existence of triangular-shaped MoS2 clusters. Compared to mechanically exfoliated crystals, the as-grown single-layer MoS2 thin films possessed consistent chemical valence states and crystal structure along with strong photoluminescence emission and optical absorbance at high energy. These results demonstrate that it is possible to scale up the growthof uniform single-layer MoS2 thin films, providing potentially important implications on realizing high-performance MoS2 devices.

Ambipolar Light-Emitting Transistors on Chemical Vapor DepositedMonolayer MoS2
Abstract:
 We realize and investigate ionic liquid gated field-effecttransistors (FETs) on large-area MoS2  monolayers grown by chemicalvapor deposition (CVD). Under electron accumulation, the performance ofthese devices is comparable to that of FETs based on exfoliated flakes. FETson CVD-grown material, however, exhibit clear ambipolar transport, which forMoS2  monolayers had not been reported previously. We exploit this propertyto estimate the bandgap Δ  of monolayer MoS2  directly from the devicetransfer curves and find Δ ≈  2.4− 2.7 eV. In the ambipolar injection regime,we observe electroluminescence due to exciton recombination in MoS2 , originating from the region close to the hole-injectingcontact. Both the observed transport properties and the behavior of the electroluminescence can be consistently understood asdue to the presence of defect states at an energy of 250− 300 meV above the top of the valence band, acting as deep traps forholes. Our results are of technological relevance, as they show that devices with useful optoelectronic functionality can be realizedon large-area MoS2  monolayers produced by controllable and scalable techniques.

Atomic layer deposition of a MoS2 film
Abstract:
A mono- to multilayer thick MoS2 film has been grown by using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniqueat 300  C on a sapphire wafer. ALD provides precise control of the MoS2 film thickness due to pulsedintroduction of the reactants and self-limiting reactions of MoCl5 and H2S. A post-deposition annealingof the ALD-deposited monolayer film improves the crystallinity of the film, which is evident from thepresence of triangle-shaped crystals that exhibit strong photoluminescence in the visible range.

Chemical vapor deposition growth of a periodic array of single-layer MoS2 islands via lithographic patterning of an SiO2/Si substrate
Abstract:
The growth of micron-scale single-layer MoS2 islands is seeded and distributed at high fidelity bymeans of a regular array of micron-scale holes that extend through the oxide layer of a 300 nmSiO2/Sisubstrate. Low coverages exhibit individual sub-micron MoS2 islands directly adjacent to the seedpositions. At moderate coverage the seed holes are encircled by merged MoS2 islands, whose overallshape and internal grain boundaries reveal coalescence out of several initial crystallites. Seeded islandsare strictly monolayer in height, non-overlapping and they offer high photoluminescence as well asconventional Raman signatures.

Growth and electrical characterization of two-dimensional layeredMoS2/SiC heterojunctions
Abstract:
 The growth and electrical characterization of the heterojunction formed between two-dimensional(2D) layered p -molybdenum disulfide (MoS2 ) and nitrogen-doped 4H silicon carbide (SiC) arereported. The integration of 2D semiconductors with the conventional three-dimensional (3D) substratescould enable semiconductor heterostructures with unprecedented properties. In this work,direct growth of p -type MoS2  films on SiC was demonstrated using chemical vapor deposition, andthe MoS2  films were found to be high quality based on x-ray diffraction and Raman spectra. Theresulting heterojunction was found to display rectification and current-voltage characteristicsconsistent with a diode for which forward conduction in the low-bias region is dominated by multisteprecombination tunneling. Capacitance-voltage measurements were used to determine thebuilt-in voltage for the p -MoS2 /n -SiC heterojunction diode, and we propose an energy band line upfor the heterostructure based on these observations. The demonstration of heterogeneous materialintegration between MoS2  and SiC enables a promising new class of 2D/3D heterostructures.

Substrate control for large area continuous ilms of monolayer MoS2 by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition
Abstract:
Growing monolayer MoS2 films that are continuous with large domain sizes by chemical vapordeposition is one of the major challenges in 2D materials research at the moment. Here, weexplore how atmospheric pressure CVD can be used to grow centimeter scale continuous filmsof monolayer MoS2 films directly on Si substrates with an oxide layer whilst also obtaining largedomain sizes exceeding 20 μm within the films. This is achieved by orientating the growthsubstrate in a vertical position to improve the uniformity of precursor feed-stock compared tohorizontally orientated growth substrates. This leads to continuous films of monolayer MoS2over a significantly larger area without the need for low-pressure vacuum systems or volatileprecursors. This provides important insights into novel approaches for maximizing domain sizeswithin MoS2 films, with concomitant large area uniform coverage.

Toward Ferroelectric Control of Monolayer MoS2
Abstract:
 The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of molybdenum disulfide(MoS2 ) single-layer films onto periodically poled lithium niobate is possible whilemaintaining the substrate polarization pattern. The MoS2  growth exhibits apreference for the ferroelectric domains polarized “ up”  with respect to the surfaceso that the MoS2 fi lm may be templated by the substrate ferroelectric polarizationpattern without the need for further lithography. MoS2  monolayers preserve thesurface polarization of the “ up”  domains, while slightly quenching the surfacepolarization on the “ down”  domains as revealed by piezoresponse forcemicroscopy. Electrical transport measurements suggest changes in the dominantcarrier for CVD MoS2  under application of an external voltage, depending on thedomain orientation of the ferroelectric substrate. Such sensitivity to ferroelectricsubstrate polarization opens the possibility for ferroelectric nonvolatile gating oftransition metal dichalcogenides in scalable devices fabricated free of exfoliationand transfer.

Towards large area and continuous MoS2 atomic layers via vapor-phase growth thermal vapor sulfurization
Abstract:
 We report on the effects of substrate, starting material, and temperature on the growth of MoS2 atomic layers by thermal vapor sulfurization in a tube-furnace system. With Mo as the startingmaterial, atomic layers of MoS2 flakes are obtained on sapphire substrates while a bell-shapedMoS2  layer, sandwiched by amorphous SiO2 , is obtained on native-SiO2 /Si substrates under thesame sulfurization conditions. An anomalous thickness-dependent Raman shift (A1g ) of theMoS2  atomic layers is observed in Mo-sulfurizations on sapphire substrates, which can beattributed to the competition between the effects of thickness and the surface/interface. Botheffects vary with the sulfurizing temperatures for a certain initial Mo thickness. The anomalousfrequency trend of A1g  is missing when using MoO3  instead of Mo as the starting material. Inthis case, the lateral growth of MoS2  on sapphire is also largely improved. Furthermore, the areadensity of the resultant MoS2  atomic layers is significantly increased by increasing the depositiontemperature of the starting MoO3  to 700 °C; the adjacent ultrathin MoS2  grains coalesce in oneor other direction, forming connected chains in wafer scale. The thickness of the so-obtainedMoS2  is generally controlled by the thickness of the starting material; however, the structural andmorphological properties of MoS2  grains, towards large area and continuous atomic layers, arestrongly dependent on the temperature of the initial material deposition, and on the temperatureof sulfurization, because of the competition between surface mobility and atom evaporation.

Van der Waals Epitaxy of Two-Dimensional MoS2 Graphene Heterostructures in Ultrahigh Vacuum
Abstract:
In this work, we demonstrate direct van der Waalsepitaxy of MoS2 graphene heterostructures on a semiconducting siliconcarbide (SiC) substrate under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Angle-resolvedphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements show thatthe electronic structure of free-standing single-layer (SL) MoS2 is retainedin these heterostructures due to the weak van der Waals interactionbetween adjacent materials. The MoS2 synthesis is based on a reactivephysical vapor deposition technique involving Mo evaporationand sulfurization in a H2S atmosphere on a template consisting ofepitaxially grown graphene on SiC. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we study the seeding of Mo on this substrate and the evolution fromnanoscale MoS2 islands to SL and bilayer (BL) MoS2 sheets during H2S exposure. Our ARPES measurements of SL and BL MoS2 on graphene reveal thecoexistence of the Dirac states of graphene and the expected valence band of MoS2 with the band maximum shifted to the corner of the Brillouinzone at K in the SL limit. We confirm the 2D character of these electronic states via a lack of dispersion with photon energy. The growth of epitaxialMoS2 graphene heterostructures on SiC opens new opportunities for further in situ studies of the fundamental properties of these complexmaterials, as well as perspectives for implementing them in various device schemes to exploit their many promising electronic and opticalproperties.

Vapor- Solid Growth of High Optical Quality MoS2 Monolayers with Near-Unity Valley Polarization
Abstract:
Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are atomically thin directgapsemiconductors with potential applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and electrochemicalsensing. Recent theoretical and experimental efforts suggest that they are ideal systemsfor exploiting the valley degrees of freedom of Bloch electrons. For example, Dirac valleypolarization has been demonstrated in mechanically exfoliated monolayer MoS2 samples bypolarization-resolved photoluminescence, although polarization has rarely been seen at roomtemperature. Here we report a new method for synthesizing high optical quality monolayer MoS2single crystals up to 25 μm in size on a variety of standard insulating substrates (SiO2, sapphire, andglass) using a catalyst-free vapor solid growth mechanism. The technique is simple and reliable,and the optical quality of the crystals is extremely high, as demonstrated by the fact that the valley polarization approaches unity at 30 K and persists at35% even at room temperature, suggesting a virtual absence of defects. This will allow greatly improved optoelectronic TMDC monolayer devices to befabricated and studied routinely.

Vapour phase growth and grain boundary structure of molybdenum disulphide atomic layers
Abstract:
Single-layered molybdenum disulphide with a direct bandgap is a promising two-dimensional material that goes beyondgraphene for the next generation of nanoelectronics. Here, we report the controlled vapour phase synthesis of molybdenumdisulphide atomic layers and elucidate a fundamental mechanism for the nucleation, growth, and grain boundary formationin its crystalline monolayers. Furthermore, a nucleation-controlled strategy is established to systematically promote theformation of large-area, single- and few-layered films. Using high-resolution electron microscopy imaging, the atomic structureand morphology of the grains and their boundaries in the polycrystalline molybdenum disulphide atomic layers are examined,and the primary mechanisms for grain boundary formation are evaluated. Grain boundaries consisting of 5- and 7- member ringsare directly observed with atomic resolution, and their energy landscape is investigated via first-principles calculations. Theuniformity in thickness, large grain sizes, and excellent electrical performance signify the high quality and scalable synthesisof the molybdenum disulphide atomic layers.

Atomic layer deposition of two dimensional MoS2 on 150mm substrates
Abstract:
 Low temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD) of monolayer to few layer MoS2  uniformly across150mm diameter SiO2 /Si and quartz substrates is demonstrated. Purge separated cycles of MoCl5 and H2 S precursors are used at reactor temperatures of up to 475  C. Raman scattering studies showclearly the in-plane (E12g ) and out-of-plane (A1g ) modes of MoS2 . The separation of the E12g  andA1g  peaks is a function of the number of ALD cycles, shifting closer together with fewer layers. Xrayphotoelectron spectroscopy indicates that stoichiometry is improved by postdeposition annealingin a sulfur ambient. High resolution transmission electron microscopy confirms the atomicspacing of monolayer MoS2  thin films.

Bifunctional Sensing Characteristics of Chemical Vapor Deposition Synthesized Atomic-Layered MoS2
Abstract:
 Two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide(MoS2 ) atomic layers have a strong potential to be adopted for2D electronic components due to extraordinary and novelproperties not available in their bulk foams. Unique properties ofthe MoS2 , including quasi-2D crystallinity, ultrahigh surface-to-volume,and a high absorption coefficient, have enabled high-performancesensor applications. However, implementation of onlya single-functional sensor presents a limitation for various advancedmultifunctional sensor applications within a single device. Here, wedemonstrate the charge-transfer-based sensitive (detection of 120ppb of NO2 ) and selective gas-sensing capability of the chemical vapor deposition synthesized MoS2  and good photosensingcharacteristics, including moderate photoresponsivity (∼ 71 mA/W), reliable photoresponse, and rapid photoswitching (<500ms). A bifunctional sensor within a single MoS2  device to detect photons and gas molecules in sequence is finally demonstrated,paving a way toward a versatile sensing platform for a futuristic multifunctional sensor.

Direct Growth of MoS2/h-BN Heterostructures via a Sulfide-Resistant Alloy
Abstract:
 Improved properties arise in transition metaldichalcogenide (TMDC) materials when they are stackedonto insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Therefore,the scalable fabrication of TMDCs/h-BN heterostructuresby direct chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth is highlydesirable. Unfortunately, to achieve this experimentally ischallenging. Ideal substrates for h-BN growth, such as Ni,become sulfides during the synthesis process. This leads to the decomposition of the pregrown h-BN fi lm, and thus noTMDCs/h-BN heterostructure forms. Here, we report a thoroughly direct CVD approach to obtain TMDCs/h-BN verticalheterostructures without any intermediate transfer steps. This is attributed to the use of a nickel-based alloy with excellentsulfide-resistant properties and a high catalytic activity for h-BN growth. The strategy enables the direct growth of single-crystalMoS2  grains of up to 200 μ m2  on h-BN, which is approximately 1 order of magnitude larger than that in previousreports. The direct band gap of our grown single-layer MoS2  on h-BN is 1.85 eV, which is quite close to that for freestandingexfoliated equivalents. This strategy is not limited to MoS2 -based heterostructures and so allows the fabrication ofa variety of TMDCs/h-BN heterostructures, suggesting the technique has promise for nanoelectronics and optoelectronicapplications.

Growth of Large-Scale and Thickness-Modulated MoS2 Nanosheets
Abstract:
 Two-dimensional MoS2  is a promising materialfor next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices dueto its unique electrical and optical properties including theband gap modulation with fi lm thickness. Although MoS2  hasshown excellent properties, wafer-scale production with layercontrol from single to few layers has yet to be demonstrated.The present study explored the large-scale and thickness-modulatedgrowth of atomically thin MoS2  on Si/SiO2 substrates using a two-step sputtering− CVD method. Ourprocess exhibited wafer-scale fabrication and successfulthickness modulation of MoS2  layers from monolayer (0.72 nm) to multilayer (12.69 nm) with high uniformity. Electricalmeasurements on MoS2 field effect transistors (FETs) revealed a p -type semiconductor behavior with much higher fi eld effectmobility and current on/off  ratio as compared to previously reported CVD grown MoS2 -FETs and amorphous silicon (a-Si) thinfi lm transistors. Our results show that sputter− CVD is a viable method to synthesize large-area, high-quality, and layer-controlledMoS2  that can be adapted in conventional Si-based microfabrication technology and future flexible, high-temperature, andradiation hard electronics/optoelectronics.

Multilayer MoS2 prepared by one-time and repeated chemical vapor depositions: anomalous Raman shifts and transistors with high ON/OFF ratio
Abstract:
 We show that multilayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2 ) grown with the chemical vapordeposition (CVD) may exhibit quite distinct behaviors of Raman shifts from those ofexfoliated ones. The anomalous Raman shifts depend on CVD growth modes and areattributed to the modified dielectric screening and interlayer coupling of MoS2  in variousgrowth conditions. With repeated CVD growths, we demonstrated the precise control overthe layer number of MoS2 . A decently large drain current, high ON/OFF ratio of 105 , andenhanced field-effect mobility can be achieved in transistors fabricated on the six-layer MoS2 .

Role of hydrogen in the chemical vapor deposition growth of MoS2 atomic layers
Abstract:
Hydrogen plays a crucial role in the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth ofgraphene. Here, we have revealed the roles of hydrogen in the two-stepCVD growth ofMoS2. Our study demonstrates that hydrogen acts as the following: (i) an inhibitor of thethermal-inducedetching effect in the continuous film growth process; and (ii) apromoter of the desulfurization reaction by decreasing the S/Mo atomic ratio and theoxidation reaction of the obtained MoSx (0 < x < 2) films. A high hydrogen content ofmore than 100% in argon forms nano-sizedcircle-likedefects and damages thecontinuity and uniformity of the film. Continuous MoS2 films with a high crystallinityand a nearly perfect S/Mo atomic ratio were finally obtained after sulfurizationannealing with a hydrogen content in the range of 20%–80%. This insightfulunderstanding reveals the crucial roles of hydrogen in the CVD growth of MoS2 andpaves the way for the controllable synthesis of two-dimensionalmaterials.

Scalable Growth of High-QualityPolycrystalline MoS2 Monolayers onSiO2 with Tunable Grain Sizes
Abstract:
We report a scalable growth of monolayer MoS2 films onSiO2 substrates by chemical vapor deposition. As-grown polycrystallineMoS2 films are continuous over the entire substrate surface with a tunablegrain size from∼20 nm up to∼1 μm. An obvious blue-shift (up to 80 meV)of photoluminescence peaks was observed from a series samples withdifferent grain sizes. Back-gated field effect transistors based on apolycrystalline MoS2 film with a typical grain size of ∼600 nm shows afield mobility of ∼7 cm2/(V s) and on/off ratio of ∼106, comparable tothose achieved from exfoliated MoS2. Our work provides a route towardscaled-up synthesis of high-quality monolayer MoS2 for electronic and optoelectronic devices.

Statistical Study of Deep Submicron Dual-Gated Field-EffectTransistors on Monolayer Chemical Vapor Deposition MolybdenumDisulfide Films
Abstract:
 Monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2 ) with a direct band gap of1.8 eV is a promising two-dimensional material with a potential to surpass graphenein next generation nanoelectronic applications. In this Letter, we synthesizemonolayer MoS2  on Si/SiO2  substrate via chemical vapor deposition (CVD)method and comprehensively study the device performance based on dual-gatedMoS2 field-effect transistors. Over 100 devices are studied to obtain a statisticaldescription of device performance in CVD MoS2 . We examine and scale down thechannel length of the transistors to 100 nm and achieve record high drain currentof 62.5 mA/mm in CVD monolayer MoS2 fi lm ever reported. We further extractthe intrinsic contact resistance of low work function metal Ti on monolayer CVDMoS2  with an expectation value of 175 Ω· mm, which can be significantly decreasedto 10 Ω· mm by appropriate gating. Finally, field-effect mobilities (μFE ) of thecarriers at various channel lengths are obtained. By taking the impact of contactresistance into account, an average and maximum intrinsic μFE  is estimated to be 13.0 and 21.6 cm2 /(V s) in monolayer CVDMoS2 films, respectively.

Wafer-scalegrowth of MoS2 thin films byatomic layer deposition
Abstract:
The wafer-scalesynthesis of MoS2 layers with precise thickness controllability andexcellent uniformity is essential for their application in the nanoelectronics industry.Here, we demonstrate the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of MoS2 films with Mo(CO)6and H2S as the Mo and S precursors, respectively. A self-limitinggrowth behavior isobserved in the narrow ALD window of 155–175 °C. Long H2S feeding times arenecessary to reduce the impurity contents in the films. The as-grownMoS2 films areamorphous due to the low growth temperature. Post-annealingat high temperaturesunder a H2S atmosphere efficiently improves the film properties including thecrystallinity and chemical composition. An extremely uniform film growth is achievedeven on a 4 inch SiO2/Si wafer. These results demonstrate that the current ALD processis well suited for the synthesis of MoS2 layers for application in industry.
