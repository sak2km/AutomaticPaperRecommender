In my reading of \"El pesimista corregido,\" I argue that the story can be interpreted as a pseudoscientific experiment taking the form of a mise en scene which, as it exposes the constructed nature of human physiology, also foregrounds the centrality of theater and illusion as mechanisms and channels for subjectivization as well as for the production of aesthetic, cultural, and political consensus.","Authors":"Comparone, L (Comparone, Loredana)","Title":"MICROSCOPY, THEATRICALITY, AND THE MAKING OF CULTURAL CONSENSUS IN THE SHORT FICTION OF SANTIAGO RAMON Y CAJAL"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Review Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395958600028 PubMed ID: 28254014 ISSN: 0308-8146 eISSN: 1873-7072","Keywords":"Saliva; Aroma release; Interactions; Enzymatic conversion; Mucins; Volatile organic compounds; Salivary proteins; Flavour KeyWords Plus:HUMAN ORAL MICROBIOME; MOUTH FLAVOR RELEASE; ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE; ARTIFICIAL SALIVA; IN-VIVO; RETRONASAL AROMA; MODEL SYSTEMS; ODORANT CONCENTRATION; SENSORY PERCEPTION; VOLATILE COMPOUNDS","Categories":"Chemistry; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics Web of Science Categories:Chemistry, Applied; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics","Journal Information":"FOOD CHEMISTRY Volume: 226 Pages: 212-220 DOI: 10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.01.055 Published: JUL 1 2017","Abstract":"Aroma perception is an important factor driving food acceptance. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released from the food matrix and then reach the receptors located in the nasal cavity, leading to their perception. These steps are closely dependent on the physicochemical properties of the volatile compounds and the food matrix, but also on human physiology. Among the different physiological parameters involved, the literature reports that saliva has various effects on VOCs and therefore appears as a major actor impacting the perception of aroma. This article reviews how saliva takes part in aroma release, considering both in vitro and in vivo approaches, and how it may affect perception. It describes the direct mechanisms (molecular interactions, enzymatic conversion, salting-out effect, dilution) involving salivary components (salts, proteins including enzymes, microbiota) that can modify the release of aroma compounds. It also considers the indirect impact of saliva, such as changes of aroma diffusion through modification of the physicochemical properties of the food matrix. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The sanitizing capacity of these solutions was studied against pathogenic bacteria Listeria monocytogenes and E. coli 0157:117 as well as phytopathogenic fungi A. alternata, F oxysporum and B. cinerea. The results showed that a 5-min treatment of inoculated blueberries with electro-activated solutions resulted in a 4 log CFU/g reduction in Listeria monocytogenes for all solutions. For E. coli 0157:H7, the electro-activated potassium acetate and potassium citrate solutions achieved a decrease of 3.5 log CFU/g after 5 min of berry washing. The most important fungus reduction was found when blueberries were washed with an electro-activated solution of potassium acetate and a NaOCl solution. After 5 min of blueberry washing with an electro-activated potassium acetate solution, a very high reduction effect was observed for A. alternata, E oxysporutn and B. cinerea, which showed survival levels of only 2.2 +/- 0.16, 034 +/- 0.15 and 0.21 +/- 0.16 log CFU/g, respectively. Regarding the effect of the washing on the organoleptic quality of blueberries, the obtained results showed no negative effect on the product color or textural profile.

Since most shale gas developments are located in semi-arid to arid U.S. regions close to agricultural production, there are many opportunities for reusing these waters as potential alternatives or supplements to fresh water resources for irrigation activities. However, the impacts of high salinity and total organic content of these types of water on crop physiological parameters and plant growth needs to be investigated to determine their utility and feasibility. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the response of switchgrass and rapeseed to treated produced water as an irrigation water source. In this greenhouse study, the influence of produced Water at four total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations [1.22, 38.3, 232.2 and 1352.4 mg/l] and three total dissolved solids (TDS) levels [400,3,500, and 21,000 mg/l] on rapeseed (Brassica napus L) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), two relatively salt-tolerant, non-food, biofuel crops, was studied. Seedling emergence, biomass yield, plant height, leaf electrolyte leakage, and plant uptake Were evaluated. Irrigation water with the highest salinity and TOC concentration resulted in significantly lower growth health and physiological characteristics of both crop species. The organic content of the produced water had a negative impact on biomass yield and physiological parameters of both species. The results of this study could be valuable for regulators and stakeholders in development of treatment standards in which organic matter should be removed to less than 50 mg/l to keep leaf EL (cell damage) to less than 50% and a TOC concentration of less than 5 mg/l required to keep a sustainable biomass production rate.

We therefore examined the effect of sFlt-1 on placental morphology and physiology at embryonic day 18.5 with histologic and morphometric analyses, transcript analyses, immunoblotting, and methylation studies. Interestingly, placental overexpression of sFlt-1 leads to IUGR in the fetus and results in lower placental weights. Moreover, we observed altered trophoblast differentiation with reduced expression of IGF2, resulting in a smaller placenta, a smaller labyrinth, and the loss of glycogen cells in the junctional zone. Changes in IGF2 are accompanied by small changes in its DNA methylation, whereas overall DNA methylation is unaffected. In addition, the expression of placental nutrient transporters, such as the glucose diffusion channel Cx26, is decreased. In contrast, the expression of the fatty acid transporter CD36 and the cholesterol transporter ABCA1 is significantly increased. In conclusion, placental sFlt-1 overexpression resulted in a reduction in the differentiation of the spongiotrophoblast into glycogen cells. These findings of a reduced exchange area of the labyrinth and glycogen stores, as well as decreased expression of glucose transporter, could contribute to the intrauterine growth restriction phenotype. All of these factors change the intrauterine availability of nutrients. Thus, we speculate that the alterations triggered by increased anti-angiogenesis strongly affect fetal outcome and programming.

Functionally, TRAFs act both as a scaffold and/or enzymatic proteins to regulate activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and transcription factors of nuclear factor-kappa B family (NF-kappa B). Given the wide variety of stimuli intracellularly conveyed by TRAF proteins, they are physiologically involved in multiple biological processes, including embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. In the last few years, it has become increasingly evident the involvement of TRAF7, the last member of the TRAF family to be discovered, in the genesis and progression of several human cancers, placing TRAF7 in the spotlight as a novel tumor suppressor protein.

However, conventional methods to monitor algal physiology use a chlorophyll fluorometer whose use is hampered by high-cost, large footprint, and limited sensitivity for practical samples containing low algal concentration. To overcome these constraints, we developed a multi-level electrode platform for resettable trapping of algae via AC electro-osmosis (ACEO) and negative dielectrophoresis. Preliminary experiments were performed in freshwater with conductivity of 0.02 S/m. Algal trapping was demonstrated at a low voltage of 2 V. The concentration effect was experimentally verified by measuring the fluorescence intensity of algae and using hemocytometer counting chambers at the inlet and outlet of the multilevel microchannel lab-on-a-chip. An optimal frequency was found for trapping, which agrees with the frequency dependence of ACED flow velocity. Through-flow rate and electrode dimensions were optimized as well. Trapping efficiencies within the range of 26%-65% have been obtained. A maximum trapping rate of 182 cells/s was obtained with a flow rate of 20 l/min. This lab-on-a-chip shows high potential for improving the limit of detection in algal monitoring and enabling the development of a portable, integrated and automated system for monitoring the quality of source drinking waters.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Microbial substrate-use efficiency is an important property during decomposition of soil organic matter. It determines the allocation of substrate towards biosynthetic stabilisation of carbon and for respiratory losses into the atmosphere. Previously, it was observed that substrate-use efficiency declines with an increase in temperature and that it varies across organic substrates. Yet, our mechanistic understanding of processes causing the temperature sensitivity of substrate-use efficiency is limited. Changes in substrate-use efficiency could be triggered by (i) shifts in the active components of microbial communities, (ii) changes in microbial physiology within the same community, or (iii) a combination of both. In the present study, we evaluated the link between microbial community composition and substrate-use efficiency, combining measurements of carbon mineralisation and microbial energetics. We found only minor shifts in microbial community composition, despite large differences in substrate use efficiencies across incubation temperatures and substrate additions. We conclude that short-term changes in substrate-use efficiency were mainly caused by changes in microbial physiology, but emphasize that future studies should focus on resolving long-term trade-offs between physiological and community influences on substrate-use efficiency.

In order to capture the major features of the phenomena under study, such as variations in arterial pressure and flow velocity, the resulting PDE models on networks require appropriate junction and boundary conditions. Instead of considering an entire network, we simulate portions of the latter and use inflow and outflow conditions which realistically mimic the behavior of the network that has not been included in the spatial domain. The resulting PDEs are solved numerically using a discontinuous Galerkin scheme for the spatial and Adam-Bashforth method for the temporal discretization.

Its patho-physiology has largely been focused on systemic and local toxicities; whereas, venom and antivenom induced oxidative stress has long been ignored. Antivenom therapy although neutralizes venom lethality and saves many lives, remains ineffective against oxidative stress. This prompted us to complement antivenom with an antioxidant molecule melatonin that would protect against oxidative stress and increase the efficacy of the existing snakebite therapy. Here we show that D. russelli and E. carinatus venoms induce strong oxidative stress that persists even after antivenom administration in mice model. Additionally, antivenoms also induce oxidative stress. Polyvalent antivenom induce more oxidative stress than monovalent antivenom. Strikingly, antivenom and melatonin together not only inhibit venom and antivenom induced oxidative stress but also significantly reduce the neutralizing antivenom dose. This study provides a therapeutic potential for enhancing the existing snakebite therapy. The combined treatment of antivenom + melatonin would prevent the upsurge of oxidative stress as well as minimize the antivenom load. Thus the investigation offers immense scope for physicians and toxinologists to reinvestigate, design new strategies and think beyond the conventional mode of antivenom therapy.

Contemporary lifestyles, with their associated unwillingness to consume leftovers and improper disposal of waste, have resulted in the disposal of huge amounts of waste into the environment. Such refuse often contains unfinished food items, many of which contain sugar and some of which can collect water from rain and generate juices. Despite evidence that mosquitoes can feed on sugar-rich suspensions, semi-liquids, and decaying fruits, which can be abundant in garbage sites, the impacts of sweet waste fluids on dengue vectors are unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of extracts from some familiar sweet home waste items on key components of vectorial capacity of Aedes aegypti. Adult mosquitoes were fed one of five diets in this study: water (WAT); sucrose (SUG); bakery product (remnant of chocolate cake, BAK); dairy product (yogurt, YOG); and fruit (banana (BAN). Differences in survival, response time to host, and egg production were examined between groups. For both males and females, maintenance on BAK extract resulted in marked survival levels that were similar to those seen with SUG. Sweet waste extracts provided better substrates for survival compared to water, but this superiority was mostly seen with BAK. Females maintained on BAK, YOG, and BAN exhibited shorter response times to a host compared to their counterparts maintained on SUG. The levels of egg production were equivalent in waste extract-and SUG-fed females. The findings presented here illustrate the potential of sweet waste-derived fluids to contribute to the vectorial capacity of dengue vectors and suggest the necessity of readdressing the issue of waste disposal, especially that of unfinished sweet foods. Such approaches can be particularly relevant in dengue endemic areas where rainfall is frequent and waste collection infrequent. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, mechanisms regulating the morphology of these mineral nanocrystals remain unclear. The dominant hypothesis attributes the size and shape regulation to organic-mineral interactions. Here, we present data supporting the hypothesis that physicochemical effects of carbonate integration within the apatite lattice control the morphology, size, and mechanics of bioapatite mineral crystals. Carbonated apatites synthesized in the absence of organic molecules presented plate-like morphologies and nanoscale crystallite dimensions. Experimentally-determined crystallite size, lattice spacing, solubility and atomic order were modified by carbonate concentration. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations predicted changes in surface energy and elastic moduli with carbonate concentration. Combining these results with a scaling law predicted the experimentally observed scaling of size and energetics with carbonate concentration. The experiments and models describe a clear mechanism by which crystal dimensions are controlled by carbonate substitution. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that carbonate substitution is sufficient to drive the formation of bone-like crystallites. This new understanding points to pathways for biomimetic synthesis of novel, nanostructured biomaterials. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Many animal species that use this type of vegetation facilitate its recovery through pollination and seed dispersal. In landscapes dominated by agrosystems and cattle ranching, persistent organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the riparian system may have an effect on the physiology and fitness of animals. In this study, we measured bioaccumulation of OCPs in the most abundant frugivorous bat, Sturnira hondurensis, from the upper part of La Antigua basin, Veracruz, Mexico and, from these data, estimated accumulation by the frugivorous bat community of riparian forests in contrasting, transformed (TL) and forested (FL) landscapes. Concentration of Sigma DDT, Sigma drines, Sigma clordano, Sigma HCH, Sigma heptachlor and Sigma endosulfan was measured by gas-chromatography in 23 female and 33 male adult Sturnira captured during the dry and rainy seasons. Using censored data statistics, we found that the sex of the individual was significant for Sigma HCH, and that interactions of landscape type (TL vs. FL) and season (dry vs. wet), and sex and season were significant for Sigma endosulfan and Sigma drines, respectively. Mean Sigma DDT (6.86 mu g/g) and Sigma HCH (28.22 mu g/g) concentrations were lower than those reported for frugivorous bats in India but concentrations of Sigma drines (13.86 mu g/g) were higher than those reported in insectivorous bats. In our study sites, frugivorous bats are bioaccumulating higher amounts of OCPs in TL than in FL. We discuss the potential of this species as a bio-indicator of OCPs contamination in river basins.

Prolonged standing is associated with multiple risk factors for musculoskeletal and venous disorders. In Germany over 50% of the working population spend most of their working time in a standing position. Basic understanding of prolonged standing physiology is lacking. We therefore plan to investigate the influence of 5 h standing (including breaks) on lower limb oedema measured by waterplethysmography (WP) and bioelectrical impedance (BI) and fatigue in the triceps surae muscle using muscle twitch force (MTF). In order to interpret our results, test-retest and inter-rater reliability of these measurement methods was evaluated first. Approach. 20 subjects (9 female) were included to test each method three times (M1, M2, M3) in 30 min periods with two raters (R1, R2) on separate days. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC; 2,1), standard error of measurement (SEM) and smallest real difference (SRD) were calculated for both raters. Main results. The SEM and SRD calculated for WP were 27 and 75 ml, respectively, for R1 and 23 and 64 ml, respectively, for R2 with an ICC of 0.98 (p < 0.0001). Statistically significant mean differences between M1 and M2 (R1 = 23 ml, p = 0.004; R2 = 19 ml, p = 0.027) but not significant mean differences between M2 and M3 (R1 = -6 ml, p = 0.45; R2 = 4 ml, p = 0.27) were calculated for both raters. BI data revealed SEM and SRD values of 3.8 and 10.5 Omega, respectively, for R1 and 3.4 and 9.4 Omega, respectively, for R2 with an ICC of 0.24 (p = 0.001). The differences between M1 and M2 (R1 = 3.9 Omega, p = 0.0001; R2 = 2.4 Omega, p = 0.049) and between M2 and M3 (R1 = 2.3 Omega, p = 0.012; R2 = 2.0 Omega, p = 0.008) were found to be statistically significant for both raters. SEM and SRD for MTF were 0.19 and 0.53 N, respectively, for R1 and 0.23 and 0.64 N, respectively, for R2 with an ICC of 0.71 (p < 0.0001). Mean differences between M1 and M2 were statistically significant for rater 1 but not for rater 2 (R1 = 0.13 N, p = 0.022; R2 = 0.12 N, p = 0.082) and the same was found for the difference between M2 and M3 for both raters (R1 = 0.04 N, p = 0.37; R2 = 0.08 N, p = 0.12). Significance. All three measurement methods showed good reliability and should be suitable for detecting effects of standing work on oedema development and fatigue as seen in previous results of long term standing experiments. Inter-rater reliability is found to be satisfactory as well, demonstrated by the small differences in SEM values of R1 and R2. Statistically significant differences shown for all three measurement methods could be due to lacking standardisation of leg placement and thus an actual lower leg volume change between measurements, indicating possibilities for further improvement of SEM values.","Authors":"Wall, R (Wall, Rudolf) ; Lips, O (Lips, Oliwia); Seibt, R (Seibt, Robert); Rieger, MA (Rieger, Monika A.); Steinhilber, B (Steinhilber, Benjamin)","Title":"Intra-and inter-rater reliability of lower leg waterplethysmography, bioelectrical impedance and muscle twitch force for the use in standing work evaluation"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397696100014 PubMed ID: 28161326 ISSN: 0031-9384","Keywords":"Early life conditions; Individual differences; Personality; Growth; Body temperature; Litter siblings KeyWords Plus:BROWN ADIPOSE-TISSUE; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; THERMALLY ADVANTAGEOUS POSITIONS; NATURAL BREEDING CONDITIONS; NEWBORN DOMESTIC RABBITS; EARLY POSTNATAL-GROWTH; EUROPEAN RABBITS; ORYCTOLAGUS-CUNICULUS; ANIMAL PERSONALITY; MOTOR DEVELOPMENT","Categories":"Psychology; Behavioral Sciences Web of Science Categories:Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences","Journal Information":"PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR Volume: 173 Pages: 101-109 DOI: 10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.01.044 Published: MAY 1 2017","Abstract":"The ontogeny of associated individual differences in behavior and physiology during early postnatal life, and in particular the emergence of such differences among litter siblings, has been hardly explored in mammals under natural conditions. We studied such within-litter differences in behavior in European rabbit pups Oryctolagus cuniculus prior to weaning, and whether and how these differences co-varied with other individual characteristics such as postnatal body temperature and early growth. The study was conducted under semi natural conditions in a colony of rabbits of wild origin, where the young were born and developed in nursery burrows. We equipped two siblings per litter with interscapular skin temperature loggers on postnatal day 2 and recorded temperature profiles for 48 h. Individual body (skin) temperatures of pups within litters were repeatable across time, indicating the existence of consistent individual differences. Such differences within litters were associated with relative differences in pre-weaning growth, revealing that relatively warmer pups showed a greater increase in body mass during the nest period. Between postnatal days 12 and 17, after the pups had reached a developmental stage of greater mobility, we carried out different behavioral tests: a handling-restraint test, an open field test and a jump-down test from a platform. Individual responses in the former two tests were associated, as those pups showing a quicker straggling response to restraint during handling also exhibited greater exploratory activity in the open field. This correlation across contexts suggests the existence of personality types in wild rabbits at an early developmental stage. Furthermore, pups' behavioral responses were strongly associated with their relative Within-litter body mass at testing. Animals with a lower body mass compared to their siblings showed a relatively quicker struggle response to handling restraint and covered a relatively larger distance in the open field, suggesting greater reactivity and responsiveness of relatively lighter pups in these tests. In contrast, relatively heavier pups jumped sooner from the platform, which may have been due to their greater physical maturation. In conclusion, our study shows that individual differences in behavior and associated differences in body temperature and growth are already present during early postnatal life, although such relationships can be easily overlooked, as they predominantly emerge as relative differences among littermates.

A prey animal's stress response increases its chance of survival during life-threatening situations through adaptive changes in behavior and physiology. Some components of the physiological stress response can lead to changes in body surface temperatures. Body temperature changes in prey could provide information about prey state to predators that sense heat, such as pit vipers. We determined whether wild rodents undergo a stress-induced change in body surface temperature upon detecting and investigating rattlesnake predators. We staged encounters between free-ranging Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami) and tethered Mojave rattlesnakes (Crotalus scutulatus) at baited feeding stations, and recorded interactions with a thermal-imaging camera. Kangaroo rats showed a significant change in maximum head temperature, snout temperature, and hind leg temperature during interactions with rattlesnakes. This supports the hypothesis that presence of a predator induces body temperature changes in prey animals. If changes in prey heat signature are detectable by heat-sensitive rattlesnakes, rattlesnakes could use this information to evaluate prey vigilance or arousal before striking; however, more detailed information on the sensory ecology of the pit organ under field conditions is needed to evaluate this possibility.

SF had free access to self-feeders whereas DS and NS were fed four times a day. Physiological stress parameters as plasma cortisol, glucose, lactate, proteins and triglycerides were determined. Under the SF setting, the 91% of feeding demands occurred during the dark phase. Furthermore, locomotor activity was also higher during the scotophase (64% of the total activity). Significantly higher values for specific growth rate (SGR).and feed efficiency rate (FER) were observed in NS (0.49 and 0.48% day(-1), respectively); whereas SF consumed much less food than the rest and presented a high mortality rate (46%). Plasma cortisol levels were dramatically increased in SF and DS compared to NS (21.8 +/- 6.1, 65.8 +/- 30.3 and 0.3 +/- 0.1 ng mL(-1), respectively). In summary, the wedge sole appears as a species with nocturnal locomotor and feeding behaviors and NS as the most appropriate feeding strategy.

In pigs, despite lack of EE being a key welfare issue there is little understanding of brain effects of EE in pigs. This project aimed to study the effects of exposure to an EE arena on piglet behaviours and on brain gene expression levels with a focus on IGF-1 and related genes. Eight litters of large white x landrace x Hampshire piglets were farrowed and raised in a free farrowing system (PigSAFE). At 42 days of age, 6 piglets per litter were given access to an enriched arena with plentiful peat, straw and space, (in groups of 4 made up of stable pairs) for 15 min per day on 5 consecutive days to allow them to habituate to the apparatus. Piglet behaviours were recorded in the arena for 15 min periods on 3 consecutive days. On the final day only one pair of test piglets per litter was given access to the arena. Brain tissue was collected within 45 min of the test from piglets exposed to the arena on the day and their non -exposed littermate controls. RNA was extracted from the frontal cortex and QRT-PCR for selected genes run on a Stratgene MX3005P. In both the home pen and the EE arena litters spent the largest proportion of time engaging in foraging behaviour which was significantly increased in the enriched arena (t(7) = 535, df = 6, p = 0.001). There were decreases in non-running play (t(7) = 4.82, p = 0.002) and inactivity (t(7) = 4.6, p = 0.002) in the arena. A significant fold change increase (FC = 1.07, t = 4.42, p = 0.002) Was observed in IGF-1 gene expression in the frontal cortex of piglets exposed to the enriched arena compared to those not exposed on the day of culling. No change in expression was observed in CSF1, the IGF-1 receptor gene nor in any of the binding proteins tested (IGFBP1-6). There was a weak tendency for increased expression of the neurotrophic factor BDNF1 (fold change: 1.03; t(7) = 1.54, p = 0.1). We believe this work is the first to explore effects of EE on pig brain physiology and development, and also points to a potential role for IGF-1 in brain effects of EE. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The expression of mutated Cx43(G138R) (which favors hemichannel, as opposed to gap-junctional activity) in EG increased gut motility in vivo, while a knock-down of Cx43 in EG resulted in the reduction of gut motility. However, inhibition of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in EG did not affect gut motility in vivo; rather, it increased the fecal pellet fluid content. Hampering either Cx43 expression or Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in EG had an effect on colonic migrating motor complexes, mainly decreasing frequency and velocity of contractions ex vivo.

This mechanism is mediated by Cdc42 activity. LysoPS is incorporated into the plasma membrane and converted to phosphatidylserine (PS) via the Lands' cycle. The accumulated PS on the membrane recruits Cdc42. Both Cdc42 and PS colocalize predominantly in primary and secondary processes, but not in peripheral branches or tips of microglia.

This review summarizes current knowledge on the differential roles of Ca++ in meiotic cell cycle resumption, arrest, and apoptosis in mammalian oocytes. Release of Ca++ from internal stores and/or Ca++ influx from extracellular medium causes moderate increase of intracellular Ca++ ([Ca++]i) level and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Increase of Ca++ as well as ROS levels under physiological range trigger maturation promoting factor (MPF) destabilization, thereby meiotic resumption from diplotene as well as metaphase-II (M-II) arrest in oocytes. A sustained increase of [Ca++]i level beyond physiological range induces generation of ROS sufficient enough to cause oxidative stress (OS) in aging oocytes. The increased [Ca++]i triggers Fas ligand-mediated oocyte apoptosis. Further, OS triggers mitochondria-mediated oocyte apoptosis in several mammalian species. Thus, Ca++ exerts differential roles on oocyte physiology depending upon its intracellular concentration. A moderate increase of [Ca++]i as well as ROS mediate spontaneous resumption of meiosis from diplotene as well as M-II arrest, while their high levels cause meiotic cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by operating both mitochondria-as well as Fas ligand-mediated apoptotic pathways. Indeed, Ca++ regulates cellular physiology by modulating meiotic cell cycle and apoptosis in mammalian oocytes.

Although lactate, a metabolic derivative of glycogen, has been reported to be consumed in oligodendrocytes as a metabolite, and to ameliorate hypomyelination induced by low glucose conditions, it is not clear about the direct contribution of lactate to cell cycling and differentiation of OPCs, and the source of lactate for remyelination. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-arabinitol (DAB), an inhibitor of the glycogen catabolic enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, in a mouse cuprizone model. Cuprizone induced demyelination in the corpus callosum and remyelination occurred after cuprizone treatment ceased. This remyelination was inhibited by the administration of DAB. To further examine whether lactate affects proliferation or differentiation of OPCs, we cultured mouse primary OPC-rich cells and analyzed the effect of lactate. Lactate rescued the slowed cell cycling induced by 0.4 mM glucose, as assessed by the BrdU-positive cell ratio. Lactate also promoted OPC differentiation detected by monitoring the mature oligodendrocyte marker myelin basic protein, in the presence of both 36.6 mM and 0.4 mM glucose. Furthermore, these lactate-mediated effects were suppressed by the reported monocarboxylate transporter inhibitor, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamate. These results suggest that lactate directly promotes the cell cycling rate and differentiation of OPCs, and that glycogen, one of the sources of lactate, contributes to remyelination in vivo.

In addition, we propose that the term 'homeocrowding' is used to describe the process by which cells maintain relatively constant levels of macromolecules.","Authors":"van den Berg, J (van den Berg, Jonas); Boersma, AJ (Boersma, Arnold J.); Poolman, B (Poolman, Bert)","Title":"Microorganisms maintain crowding homeostasis"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397552000007 PubMed ID: 28189709 ISSN: 1569-9048 eISSN: 1878-1519","Keywords":"Chicken embryos; Hypercapnia; Hypoxia; Acid-base disturbances; Hematology; Metabolic compensation KeyWords Plus:METABOLIC COMPENSATION; CHALLENGES; BALANCE; GROWTH; BLOOD; HEMATOCRIT; OXYGEN; HATCHLINGS; PHYSIOLOGY; BROILER","Categories":"Physiology; Respiratory System Web of Science Categories:Physiology; Respiratory System","Journal Information":"RESPIRATORY PHYSIOLOGY & NEUROBIOLOGY Volume: 239 Pages: 55-63 DOI: 10.1016/j.resp.2017.02.001 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"Most experiments examining acid-base regulation of chicken embryos have employed static, single time point measurements rather than dynamic, multiple time point measurements that might reveal additional components of developing acid-base regulation.

For more than 50 years, this concept has been investigated using approaches that include partitioning the social component out of behavioural heritability estimates, studying maternal effects on offspring, and analysing dominance hierarchies. Recent advances have formalized this 'social environment effect' by providing a more nuanced approach to the study of social influences on behaviour while recognizing evolutionary implications. Yet, in most of these formulations, the dynamics of social interactions are not accounted for. Also, the reciprocity between individual behaviour and group-level interactions has been largely ignored. Consistent with evolutionary theory, the principles of social interaction are conserved across a broad range of taxa. While noting parallels in diverse organisms, this review uses Drosophila melanogaster as a case study to revisit what is known about social interaction paradigms. We highlight the benefits of integrating the history and pattern of interactions among individuals for dissecting molecular mechanisms that underlie social modulation of behaviour.","Authors":"Schneider, J (Schneider, Jonathan) ; Atallah, J (Atallah, Jade) ; Levine, JD (Levine, Joel D.)","Title":"Social structure and indirect genetic effects: genetics of social behaviour"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Review Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398567200026 PubMed ID: 27020603 ISSN: 1464-7931 eISSN: 1469-185X","Keywords":"brain functions; phenotypic plasticity; glucose; steroids; food shortage; energy; fitness KeyWords Plus:MICE PEROMYSCUS-LEUCOPUS; WILD BIRD POPULATION; ADULT MALE RATS; CALORIC RESTRICTION; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; LEARNING-ABILITY; GLUCOSE-HOMEOSTASIS; GONADAL-HORMONES; ANIMAL COGNITION","Categories":"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:Biology","Journal Information":"BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS Volume: 92 Issue: 2 Pages: 1101-1112 DOI: 10.1111/brv.12270 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"Cognitive performance is based on brain functions, which have energetic demands and are modulated by physiological parameters such as metabolic hormones. As both environmental demands and environmental energy availability change seasonally, we propose that cognitive performance in free-living animals might also change seasonally due to phenotypic plasticity. This is part of an emerging research field, the 'ecophysiology of cognition': environmentally induced changes in physiological traits, such as blood glucose and hormone levels, are predicted to influence cognitive performance in free-living animals. Energy availability for the brain might change, and as such cognition, with changing energetic demands (e.g. reproduction) and changes of energy availability in the environment (e.g. winter, drought). Individuals spending more energy than they can currently obtain from their environment (allostatic overload type I) are expected to trade off energy investment between cognition and other life-sustaining processes or even reproduction. Environmental changes reducing energy availability might thus impair cognition. However, selection pressures such as predation risk, mate choice or social demands may act on the trade-off between energy saving and cognition. We assume that different environmental conditions can lead to three different trade-off outcomes: cognitive impairment, resilience or enhancement. Currently we cannot understand these trade-offs, because we lack information about changes in cognitive performance due to seasonal changes in energy availability and both the resulting changes in homeostasis (for example, blood glucose levels) and the associated changes in the mechanisms of allostasis (for example, hormone levels). Additionally, so far we know little about the fitness consequences of individual variation in cognitive performance. General cognitive abilities, such as attention and associative learning, might be more important in determining fitness than complex and specialized cognitive abilities, and easier to use for comparative study in a large number of species. We propose to study seasonal changes in cognitive performance depending on energy availability in populations facing different predation risks, and the resulting fitness consequences.","Authors":"Maille, A (Maille, Audrey) ; Schradin, C (Schradin, Carsten)","Title":"Ecophysiology of cognition: How do environmentally induced changes in physiology affect cognitive performance?"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Review Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398567200027 PubMed ID: 27062218 ISSN: 1464-7931 eISSN: 1469-185X","Keywords":"bird flight; feather deformities; perturbations; physiology; stress KeyWords Plus:WHITE-CROWNED SPARROWS; CORVUS-CORONE-CORNIX; ZONOTRICHIA-LEUCOPHRYS-GAMBELII; TIT PARUS-MAJOR; AMERICAN KESTRELS; PASSER-DOMESTICUS; NATURAL-SELECTION; KAWASAKI-DISEASE; POSTNUPTIAL MOLT; PELAGIC SEABIRD","Categories":"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:Biology","Journal Information":"BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS Volume: 92 Issue: 2 Pages: 1113-1127 DOI: 10.1111/brv.12273 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"Fault bars are narrow malformations in feathers oriented almost perpendicular to the rachis where the feather vein and even the rachis may break. Breaks in the barbs and barbules result in small pieces of the feather vein being lost, while breaks in the rachis result in loss of the distal portion of the feather. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of 74 papers on fault bar formation in hopes of providing a clearer approach to their study. First, we review the evidence that the propensity to develop fault bars is modified by natural selection. Given that fault bars persist in the face of survival costs, we conclude that they must be an unfortunate consequence of some alternative adaptation that outweighs the fitness costs of fault bars. Second, we summarize evidence that the development of fault bars is triggered by psychological stress such as that of handling or predation attempts, and that they persist because the sudden contractions of the muscles in the feather follicle that control fright moults also causes the development of fault bars in growing feathers. Third, we review external and physiological (e.g. corticosterone) agents that may affect the likelihood that an acute stress will result in a growing feather exhibiting a fault bar. These modifying factors have often been treated as fundamental causes in the earlier literature on fault bars. Fourth, we then use this classification to propose a tentative model where fault bars of different severity (from light to severe) are the outcome of the interaction between the propensity to produce fault bars (which differs between species, individuals and feather follicles within individuals) and the intensity of the perturbation. This model helps to explain contradictory results in the literature, to identify gaps in our knowledge, and to suggest further studies. Lastly, we discuss ways in which better understanding of fault bars can inform us about other aspects of avian evolutionary ecology, such as the physiology of moult, the integration of moult into avian life cycles, and the strategies used to minimize stress during moult. Moreover, the study of fault bars may be relevant to understanding the aerodynamics of flight and the early evolution of flight.","Authors":"Jovani, R (Jovani, Roger) ; Rohwer, S (Rohwer, Sievert)","Title":"Fault bars in bird feathers: mechanisms, and ecological and evolutionary causes and consequences"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396640600044 PubMed ID: 28189099 ISSN: 0147-6513 eISSN: 1090-2414","Keywords":"OECD; Immobilisation; Algae; Multiwell plate; Automation; Metal KeyWords Plus:REPRODUCTION; MATURATION; METALS","Categories":"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Toxicology Web of Science Categories:Environmental Sciences; Toxicology","Journal Information":"ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY Volume: 139 Pages: 352-357 DOI: 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.02.002 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"Phenotypic markers of animal health form an essential component of regulatory toxicology. Immobilisation of neonate water fleas - Daphnia magna - as a surrogate measure of their mortality following exposure to a chemical for 24-48 h forms the basis of the internationally utilised OECD acute toxicity test 202. A second important marker of animal physiology and health is feeding rate, which in Daphnia is determined by measuring the algae feeding rate. Given the widespread use of OECD test 202 for acute toxicity as well as the quantification of feeding rate in toxicological studies of daphniids, significant benefits could result from miniaturising this assay. In particular, miniaturisation would use fewer animals, less media and chemicals, less laboratory space and make the tests more compatible with automation, and therefore could result in considerable time savings. Furthermore, miniaturising phenotypic markers to the ultimate level of a single animal per well would facilitate multiple measurements of other phenotypic markers, such as behavioural responses, which could be integrated at the individual level. In this study we used a wide range of exposure vessels to evaluate the impacts of systematically varying total media volume, surface to volume ratio and animal density for the acute toxicity testing of cadmium. We demonstrate that Daphnia acute toxicity tests using single animals within 24- or 48-well plates produce equivalent results as for traditional test configurations, for different chemicals. Considering algae feeding rates by Daphnia, we studied the impacts of varying algae concentration, total volume and animal density. After having demonstrated that multiwell plates can again yield equivalent test results as traditional experimental setups, we used miniaturised test vessels to show the impact of metals on the feeding activity on daphniids for both neonates and adult animals. Overall we confirm the feasibility of a multiwell approach for Daphnia toxicity testing that requires less time and materials than a traditional assay and can provide phenotypic characterisation at a single animal level.","Authors":"Grintzalis, K (Grintzalis, Konstantinos) ; Dai, WK (Dai, Wenkui) ; Panagiotidis, K (Panagiotidis, Konstantinos) ; Belavgeni, A (Belavgeni, Alexia) ; Viant, MR (Viant, Mark R.)","Title":"Miniaturising acute toxicity and feeding rate measurements in Daphnia magna"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398566800022 PubMed ID: 28232472 ISSN: 0017-5749 eISSN: 1468-3288","Categories":"Gastroenterology & Hepatology Web of Science Categories:Gastroenterology & Hepatology","Journal Information":"GUT Volume: 66 Issue: 5 Pages: 966-974 DOI: 10.1136/gutjnl-2016-313425 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"This review introduces the principles of visceral sensation and appraises the current approaches to management of visceral pain in functional GI diseases, principally IBS.

Information concerning geographic variations in response to climate variability is critical because many morphological, life history and physiological traits show variation across space. Reciprocal transplant experiments have shown to be relevant to evaluate the role of phenotypic plasticity and potential local adaptation in ecophysiological responses when coping with environmental variability. In this study, we characterize through reciprocal transplant experiments the reaction norms of morphological, biochemical, physiological and life-history traits between two intertidal populations of the socioeconomically important mussel Mytilus chilensis, inhabiting contrasting local environments (estuarine vs coastal habitats). We found a gradient in phenotypic plasticity with plastic trait responses in metabolic, ingestion and clearance rates, and in HsP(70) gene expression, and some traits with responses more canalized as growth and calcification rates. This emphasizes that responses not only vary across different local populations but also in different traits in M. chilensis, thus it is difficult to establish an overall trend of the responses at integrated organismal level. Moreover, the synergistic interaction of factors such as salinity and carbonate system parameters evaluated make it necessary to study the response at the population level with emphasis on benthic species important in aquaculture. Finally, field studies such as this one are useful for documenting the patterns of traits variation that occur in nature, identifying possible causes of such variation, and generating testable hypotheses for future controlled experiments.

Such strategy can be used to attach the biomolecule receptors in a reproducible way simply by incubation of the transducer element in a solution containing such copolymers which largely facilitated the sensor functionalization at an industrial scale. As the synthesized copolymers are cationic in physiology pH, surface biotinylation can be easily achieved via electrostatic adsorption on negatively charged sensor surface. Biotinylated receptors can be subsequently attached through well-defined biotin-streptavidin interaction. In this work, the bioactive sensor surfaces were applied for mouse IgG and prostate specific antigen (PSA) detections using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), optical sensor (BioLayer Interferometry) and conventional ELISA test ( colorimetry). A limit of detection (LOD) of 0.5 nM was achieved for PSA detections both in HEPES buffer and serum dilutions in ELISA tests. The synthesized PLL-g-OEGx-Biotin copolymers with different OEG chain length were also compared for their biosensing performance. Moreover, the surface regeneration was achieved by pH stimulation to remove the copolymers and the bonded analytes, while maintaining the sensor reusability as well. Thus, the developed PLL-g-OEGx-Biotin surface assembling strategy is believed to be a versatile surface coating method for protein detections with multi-sensor compatibility. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, only preliminary information is known regarding the ecology and physiology of the source organisms of these biomarkers. We assessed the production rates of brGDGTs under different redox conditions in peat, where these lipids are found in high concentrations, particularly at greater depths below the fluctuating water table. The incorporation of hydrogen relative to carbon into lipids observed in our dual stable isotope probing assay indicates that brGDGTs were produced by heterotrophic bacteria. Unexpectedly, incubations with stable isotope tracers of the surface horizon (5-20 cm) initiated under oxic conditions before turning suboxic and eventually anoxic exhibited up to one order of magnitude higher rates of brGDGT production (16-87 ng cm(-3) y(-1)) relative to the deeper, anoxic zone (20-35 cm; ca. 7 ng cm(- 3) y(-1)), and anoxic incubations of the surface horizon (< 3 ng cm(-3) y(-1)). Turnover times of brGDGTs in the surface horizon ranged between 8 and 41 years in the incubations initiated under oxic conditions, in contrast to 123 742 years in anoxic incubations. As brGDGTs were actively produced during both anoxic incubations and those exposed to oxygen, we conclude that their source organisms are likely facultative aerobic heterotrophs that are particularly active in the peat acrotelm. Production rates of bacterial fatty acids (ca. 2 mu g cm(-3) y(-1)) were roughly two orders of magnitude higher than those of brGDGTs, suggesting that brGDGT producers are a minor constituent of the microbial community or that brGDGTs are a small component of the microbial cell membrane in comparison to fatty acids, despite the typically high brGDGT concentrations observed in peat.

These ion channels are abundantly expressed in the mammalian brain where glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter. The neurotransmitters and their receptors are being increasingly detected in the cells of immune system. Here we examined the expression of the 18 known subunits of the iGlu receptors families; alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), kainate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and delta in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We compared the expression of the subunits between four groups: men, non-pregnant women, healthy pregnant women and depressed pregnant women. Out of 18 subunits of the iGlu receptors, mRNAs for 11 subunits were detected in PBMCs from men and nonpregnant women; AMPA: GluA3, GluA4, kainate: GluK2, GluK4, GluK5, NMDA: GluN1, GluN2C, GluN2D, GluN3A, GluN3B, and delta: GluD1. In the healthy and the depressed pregnant women, in addition, the delta GluD2 subunit was identified. The mRNAs for GluK4, GluK5, GluN2C and GluN2D were expressed at a higher level than other subunits. Gender, pregnancy or depression during pregnancy altered the expression of GluA3, GluK4, GluN2D, GluN3B and GluD1 iGlu subunit mRNAs. The greatest changes recorded were the lower GluA3 and GluK4 mRNA levels in pregnant women and the higher GluN2D mRNA level in healthy but not in depressed pregnant women as compared to non-pregnant individuals. Using subunit specific antibodies, the GluK4, GluK5, GluNl, GluN2C and GluN2D subunit proteins were identified in the PBMCs. The results show expression of specific iGlu receptor subunit in the PBMCs and support the idea of physiology-driven changes of iGlu receptors subtypes in the immune cells. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The amplitude of B/Ca banding broadly conforms to banding predicted using the bulk-shell B/Ca sensitivity to the carbonate chemistry changes in the foraminiferal microenvironment.

Heart failure in patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome predicated by functional single ventricle lesions is associated with an increase in CHD prevalence and remains a significant challenge. Pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the progression of CHD, including single ventricle lesions and dilated cardiomyopathy, and adult heart disease may inevitably differ. Although therapeutic options for advanced cardiac failure are restricted to heart transplantation or mechanical circulatory support, there is a strong impetus to develop novel therapeutic strategies. As lower vertebrates, such as the newt and zebrafish, have a remarkable ability to replace lost cardiac tissue, this intrinsic self-repair machinery at the early postnatal stage in mice was confirmed by partial ventricular resection. Although the underlying mechanistic insights might differ among the species, mammalian heart regeneration occurs even in humans, with the highest degree occurring in early childhood and gradually declining with age in adulthood, suggesting the advantage of stem cell therapy to ameliorate ventricular dysfunction in patients with CHD. Although effective clinical translation by a variety of stem cells in adult heart disease remains inconclusive with respect to the improvement of cardiac function, case reports and clinical trials based on stem cell therapies in patients with CHD may be invaluable for the next stage of therapeutic development. Dissecting the differential mechanisms underlying progressive ventricular dysfunction in children and adults may lead us to identify a novel regenerative therapy. Future regenerative technologies to treat patients with CHD are exciting prospects for heart regeneration in general practice.","Authors":"Oh, H (Oh, Hidemasa)","Title":"Cell Therapy Trials in Congenital Heart Disease"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398648000040 ISSN: 0304-4238 eISSN: 1879-1018","Keywords":"Pears; Coating; CMC; Potassium sorbate; Fungi KeyWords Plus:FRAGARIA X ANANASSA; EDIBLE COATINGS; BARTLETT PEARS; COLD-STORAGE; RIPENING BEHAVIOR; QUALITY; FRUIT; ATMOSPHERE; EMULSIONS; RESPONSES","Categories":"Agriculture Web of Science Categories:Horticulture","Journal Information":"SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE Volume: 218 Pages: 326-333 DOI: 10.1016/j.scienta.2017.02.040 Published: APR 14 2017","Abstract":"The main objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a coating composed of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), candelilla wax and potassium sorbate (KS) as a post-cold-storage treatment to prevent fungal infections in pears stored under simulated retail display conditions. Moreover, the effect of coating on the physiology and biochemistry of pears was investigated. The coating was very effective against Botrytis cinerea and MoniIinia fructigena, while Rhizopus nigricans was the most resistant to KS. The KS-free coating also delayed the fungal growth rate, probably due to modification of the gaseous atmosphere within the fruit tissues. Coated pears showed slower ripening than the uncoated samples, as indicated by unaffected green skin color and inhibited loss of firmness. Unfortunately, coating induced anaerobic respiration and the symptoms of superficial scald in pears. Overall, the results showed that KS can be added into a coating formulation to control fungal growth; however, CMC-based emulsion is not a suitable carrier for KS, when coating is intended to be applied to pears exposed to postharvest cold storage.

Her.). Eucalypt species occur from high rainfall to semi-arid zones and from the tropics to latitudes as high as 43 degrees S. Despite several morphological and metabolomic characterizations, little is known regarding gene expression differences that underpin differences in tolerance to environmental change. Using species of contrasting taxonomy, morphology and physiology (E. globulus and E. cladocalyx), this study combines physiological characterizations with `second-generation' sequencing to identify key genes involved in eucalypt responses to medium-term water limitation. Results: One hundred twenty Million high-quality HiSeq reads were created from 14 tissue samples in plants that had been successfully subjected to a water deficit treatment or a well-watered control. Alignment to the E. grandis genome saw 23,623 genes of which 468 exhibited differential expression (FDR < 0.01) in one or both ecotypes in response to the treatment. Further analysis identified 80 genes that demonstrated a significant species-specific response of which 74 were linked to the 'dry' species E. cladocalyx where 23 of these genes were uncharacterised. The majority (approximately 80%) of these differentially expressed genes, were expressed in stem tissue. Key genes that differentiated species responses were linked to photoprotection/redox balance, phytohormone/signalling, primary photosynthesis/cellular metabolism and secondary metabolism based on plant metabolic pathway network analysis. Conclusion: These results highlight a more definitive response to water deficit by a 'dry' climate eucalypt, particularly in stem tissue, identifying key pathways and associated genes that are responsible for the differences between 'wet' and 'dry' climate eucalypts. This knowledge provides the opportunity to further investigate and understand the mechanisms and genetic variation linked to this important environmental response that will assist with genomic efforts in managing native populations as well as in tree improvement programs under future climate scenarios.","Authors":"Spokevicius, AV (Spokevicius, Antanas V.) ; Tibbits, J (Tibbits, Josquin) ; Rigault, P (Rigault, Philippe) ; Nolin, MA (Nolin, Marc-Alexandre) ; Muller, C (Mueller, Caroline) ; Merchant, A (Merchant, Andrew)","Title":"Medium term water deficit elicits distinct transcriptome responses in Eucalyptus species of contrasting environmental origin"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398414400001 ISSN: 1664-2392","Keywords":"mouse pancreatic islet; alpha- and beta-cells; primary culture; in vitro synchronization; circadian bioluminescence KeyWords Plus:GENE-EXPRESSION; INSULIN-SECRETION; ISLET CELLS; CLOCK; MICE; METABOLISM; CONSEQUENCES; PHYSIOLOGY; PANCREAS; RELEASE","Categories":"Endocrinology & Metabolism Web of Science Categories:Endocrinology & Metabolism","Journal Information":"FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY Volume: 8 Article Number: 68 DOI: 10.3389/fendo.2017.00068 Published: APR 7 2017","Abstract":"Circadian clocks have been developed in evolution as an anticipatory mechanism allowing for adaptation to the constantly changing light environment due to rotation of the Earth. This mechanism is functional in all light-sensitive organisms. There is a considerable body of evidence on the tight connection between the circadian clock and most aspects of physiology and metabolism. Clocks, operative in the pancreatic islets, have caught particular attention in the last years due to recent reports on their critical roles in regulation of insulin secretion and etiology of type 2 diabetes. While beta-cell clocks have been extensively studied during the last years, alpha-cell clocks and their role in islet function and orchestration of glucose metabolism stayed unexplored, largely due to the difficulty to isolate alpha-cells, which represents a considerable technical challenge. Here, we provide a detailed description of an experimental approach for the isolation of separate mouse alpha- and beta-cell population, culture of isolated primary alpha- and beta-cells, and their subsequent long-term high-resolution circadian bioluminescence recording. For this purpose, a triple reporter ProGlucagon-Venus/RIP-Cherry/Per2: Luciferase mouse line was established, carrying specific fluorescent reporters for alpha- and beta-cells, and luciferase reporter for monitoring the molecular clockwork. Flow cytometry fluorescence-activated cell sorting allowed separating pure alpha-and beta-cell populations from isolated islets. Experimental conditions, developed by us for the culture of functional primary mouse alpha- and beta-cells for at least 10 days, will be highlighted. Importantly, temporal analysis of freshly isolated alpha- and beta-cells around-the-clock revealed preserved rhythmicity of core clock genes expression. Finally, we describe the setting to assess circadian rhythm in cultured alpha- and beta-cells synchronized in vitro. The here-described methodology allows to analyze the functional properties of primary alpha- and beta-cells under physiological or pathophysiological conditions and to assess the islet cellular clock properties.","Authors":"Petrenko, V (Petrenko, Volodymyr) ; Gosmain, Y (Gosmain, Yvan) ; Dibner, C (Dibner, Charna)","Title":"High-Resolution Recording of the Circadian Oscillator in Primary Mouse alpha- and beta-Cell Culture"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397701300003 PubMed ID: 28108306 ISSN: 0022-5193 eISSN: 1095-8541","Keywords":"Bone physiology; Trabecular remodeling; Osteocytes; Osteoclasts; Osteoblasts; Spatial evolutionary games; Interacting particle systems KeyWords Plus:LOTKA-VOLTERRA EQUATION; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; OSTEOCLAST DIFFERENTIATION; AUTOCRINE REGULATION; REPLICATOR DYNAMICS; RESORPTION; CLASSIFICATION; SCLEROSTIN; OSTEOBLAST; OSTEOCYTES","Categories":"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Mathematical & Computational Biology Web of Science Categories:Biology; Mathematical & Computational Biology","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY Volume: 418 Pages: 16-26 DOI: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.01.021 Published: APR 7 2017","Abstract":"Bone remodeling is a complex process involving cell-cell interactions, biochemical signaling and mechanical stimuli. Early models of the biological aspects of remodeling were non-spatial and focused on the local dynamics at a fixed location in the bone. Several spatial extensions of these models have been proposed, but they generally suffer from two limitations: first, they are not amenable to analysis and are computationally expensive, and second, they neglect the role played by bone-embedded osteocytes. To address these issues, we developed a novel model of spatial remodeling based on the principles of evolutionary game theory. The analytically tractable framework describes the spatial interactions between zones of bone resorption, bone formation and quiescent bone, and explicitly accounts for regulation of remodeling by bone-embedded, mechanotransducing osteocytes. Using tools from the theory of interacting particle systems we systematically classified the different dynamic regimes of the spatial model and identified regions of parameter space that allow for global coexistence of resorption, formation and quiescence, as observed in physiological remodeling. In coexistence scenarios, three-dimensional simulations revealed the emergence of sponge-like bone clusters. Comparison between spatial and non-spatial dynamics revealed substantial differences and suggested a stabilizing role of space. Our findings emphasize the importance of accounting for spatial structure and bone-embedded osteocytes when modeling the process of bone remodeling. Thanks to the lattice-based framework, the proposed model can easily be coupled to a mechanical model of bone loading.","Authors":"Ryser, MD (Ryser, Mare D.) ; Murgas, KA (Murgas, Kevin A.)","Title":"Bone remodeling as a spatial evolutionary game"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398548100007 PubMed ID: 28389651 ISSN: 2045-2322","Categories":"Science & Technology - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:Multidisciplinary Sciences","Journal Information":"SCIENTIFIC REPORTS Volume: 7 Article Number: 725 DOI: 10.1038/s41598-017-00732-5 Published: APR 7 2017","Abstract":"The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) for ATP is a therapeutic target for pathophysiological states including inflammation, pain management and epilepsy.

AZ10606120 is a selective antagonist for P2X7Rs (IC50 of -10 nM) and ineffective at the P2X1R (at 10 mu M). To determine the molecular basis of selectivity we generated a series of P2X7/1R chimeras and mutants. Two regions that are unique to the P2X7R, a loop insertion (residues 73-79) and threonine residues T90 and T94, are required for high affinity antagonist action. Point mutations ruled out an orthosteric antagonist site. Mutations and molecular modelling identified an allosteric binding site that forms at the subunit interface at the apex of the receptor.

Notably, only uFBA predicts that stored red blood cells metabolize TCA intermediates to regenerate important cofactors, such as ATP, NADH, and NADPH.

Disturbance of these patterns is associated with hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Kidney oxygenation is dependent on oxygen delivery and consumption that in turn are determined by renal hemodynamics and metabolism. We hypothesized that kidney oxygenation also demonstrates 24-h periodicity. Telemetric oxygen-sensitive carbon paste electrodes were implanted in Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g), either in renal medulla (n = 9) or cortex (n = 7). Arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored by telemetry in a separate group (n = 8). Data from 5 consecutive days were analyzed for rhythmicity by cosinor analysis. Diurnal electrolyte excretion was assessed by metabolic cages. During lights-off, oxygen levels increased to 105.3 +/- 2.1% in cortex and 105.2 +/- 3.8% inmedulla. MAP was 97.3 +/- 1.5mmHg and HR was 394.0 +/- 7.9 bpm during lights-off phase and 93.5 +/- 1.3 mmHg and 327.8 +/- 8.9 bpm during lights-on. During lights-on, oxygen levels decreased to 94.6 +/- 1.4% in cortex and 94.2 +/- 8.5% in medulla. There was significant 24-h periodicity in cortex and medulla oxygenation. Potassium excretion (1,737 +/- 779 vs. 895 +/- 132 ae mol/12 h, P = 0.005) and the distal Na+/K+ exchange (0.72 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.59 +/- 0.02 P < 0.001) were highest in the lights-off phase, this phase difference was not found for sodium excretion (P = 0.4). It seems that oxygen levels in the kidneys follow the pattern of oxygen delivery, which is known to be determined by renal blood flow and peaks in the active phase (lights-off).","Authors":"Emans, TW (Emans, Tonja W.) ; Janssen, BJ (Janssen, Ben J.) ; Joles, JA (Joles, Jaap A.) ; Krediet, CTP (Krediet, C.

Interestingly, these compounds also play a role on plant physiology, being especially relevant their role in plant defense against biotic and abiotic stress. Hence, we hypothesize that since blackberry fruits have high amounts of flavonols and anthocyanins, leaves would also have high amounts of these compounds, and can be studied as a source of active molecules; furthermore, leaf synthesis would support their high contents in fruits. To explore this hypothesis, the present study reports a de novo transcriptome analysis on field grown blackberry leaves and fruits at the same time point, to establish the metabolic relationship of these compounds in both organs. Transcripts were aligned against Fragaria vesca genome, and genes were identified and annotated in different databases; tissue expression pattern showed 20,463 genes common to leaves and fruits, while 6,604 genes were significantly overexpressed only in fruits, while another 6,599 genes were significantly overexpressed in leaves, among which flavonol-anthocyanin transporter genes were present. Bioactives characterization indicated that total phenolics in leaves were three-fold, and flavonols were six-fold than in fruits, while concentration of anthocyanins was higher in fruits; HPLC-MS analysis indicated different composition in leaves and fruits, with cyanidin-3-glucoside as the only common compound identified. Next, RT-qPCR of the core genes in the flavonol anthocyanin pathway and regulatory MYB genes were carried out. Interestingly, genes in the flavonol-anthocyanin pathway and flavonol-transport families were overexpressed in leaves, consistent with the higher bioactive levels. On the other hand, transcription factors were overexpressed in fruits anticipating an active anthocyanin biosynthesis upon ripening. This suggests that, in addition to the biosynthesis taking place in the fruits during ripening, translocation of flavonols from leaves to fruits contributes to the high amounts of bioactives starting to accumulate in fruits.","Authors":"Gutierrez, E (Gutierrez, Enrique) ; Garcia-Villaraco, A (Garcia-Villaraco, Ana) ; Lucas, JA (Lucas, Jose A.) ; Gradillas, A (Gradillas, Ana) ; Gutierrez-Manero, FJ (Javier Gutierrez-Manero, F.) ; Ramos-Solano, B (Ramos-Solano, Beatriz)","Title":"Transcriptomics, Targeted Metabolomics and Gene Expression of Blackberry Leaves and Fruits Indicate Flavonoid Metabolic Flux from Leaf to Red Fruit"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398366300014 PubMed ID: 28388438 ISSN: 1097-2765 eISSN: 1097-4164","Categories":"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology Web of Science Categories:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology","Journal Information":"MOLECULAR CELL Volume: 66 Issue: 1 Pages: 129-+ DOI: 10.1016/j.molcel.2017.03.004 Published: APR 6 2017","Abstract":"ATAXIN-2 (ATX2) has been implicated in human neurodegenerative diseases, yet it remains elusive how ATX2 assembles specific protein complexes to execute its physiological roles. Here we employ the posttranscriptional co-activator function of Drosophila ATX2 to demonstrate that LSM12 and ME31B/DDX6 are two ATX2-associating factors crucial for sustaining circadian rhythms. LSM12 acts as a molecular adaptor for the recruitment of TWENTY-FOUR (TYF) to ATX2. The ATX2-LSM12TYF complex thereby stimulates TYF-dependent translation of the rate-limiting clock gene period (per) tomaintain 24 hr periodicity in circadian behaviors. In contrast, ATX2 contributes to NOT1-mediated gene silencing and associates with NOT1 in a ME31B/DDX6-dependent manner. The ME31B/DDX6-NOT1 complex does not affect PER translation but supports high-amplitude behavioral rhythms along with ATX2, indicating a PER-independent clock function of ATX2. Taken together, these data suggest that the ATX2 complex may switch distinct modes of posttranscriptional regulation through its associating factors to control circadian clocks and ATX2-related physiology.","Authors":"Lee, J (Lee, Jongbo) ; Yoo, E (Yoo, Eunseok) ; Lee, H (Lee, Hoyeon) ; Park, K (Park, Keunhee) ; Hur, JH (Hur, Jin-Hoe) ; Lim, C (Lim, Chunghun)","Title":"LSM12 and ME31B/DDX6 Define Distinct Modes of Posttranscriptional Regulation by ATAXIN-2 Protein Complex in Drosophila Circadian Pacemaker Neurons"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000394259600007 PubMed ID: 28382205 ISSN: 2042-8898 eISSN: 2042-8901","Keywords":"mitochondria; genetically encoded redox probes; hydrogen peroxide; pentose phosphate pathway KeyWords Plus:SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; RETROGRADE RESPONSE; NITRIC-OXIDE; CELLS; HYPOXIA; PATHWAY; DYSFUNCTION; EXPRESSION; VECTORS","Categories":"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:Biology","Journal Information":"INTERFACE FOCUS Volume: 7 Issue: 2 Article Number: 20160143 DOI: 10.1098/rsfs.2016.0143 Published: APR 6 2017","Abstract":"Mitochondrially generated oxidants are believed to play important roles in both physiology and pathophysiology.

These receptors can act as transcription factors and regulate gene expression. However, steroid-dependent transcriptional regulation in different types of neural cells is not yet fully understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare transcriptional alterations induced by various steroid receptor agonists in primary cultures of astrocytes and neurons from mouse brain. Results: We utilized whole-genome microarrays (Illumina Mouse WG-6) and quantitative PCR analyses to measure mRNA abundance levels. To stimulate gene expression we treated neuronal and astroglial cultures with dexamethasone (100 nM), aldosterone (200 nM), progesterone (200 nM), 5a-dihydrotestosterone (200 nM) and beta-Estradiol (200 nM) for 4 h. Neurons were found to exhibit higher levels of expression of mineralocorticoid receptor, progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor 2 than astrocytes. However, higher mRNA level of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA was observed in astrocytes. We identified 956 genes regulated by steroids. In astrocytes we found 381 genes altered by dexamethasone and 19 altered by aldosterone. Functional classification of the regulated genes indicated their putative involvement in multiple aspects of cell metabolism (up-regulated Slc2a1, Pdk4 and Slc45a3) and the inflammatory response (down-regulated Ccl3, Il1b and Tnf). Progesterone, dihydrotestosterone and estradiol did not change gene expression in astrocytes. We found no significant changes in gene expression in neurons. Conclusions: The obtained results indicate that glial cells might be the primary targets of transcriptional action of steroids in the central nervous system. Substantial changes in gene expression driven by the glucocorticoid receptor imply an important role for the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the hormone-dependent regulation of brain physiology. This is an in vitro study. Hence, the model may not accurately reflect all the effects of steroids on gene expression in neurons in vivo.","Authors":"Piechota, M (Piechota, Marcin) ; Korostynski, M (Korostynski, Michal) ; Golda, S (Golda, Slawomir) ; Ficek, J (Ficek, Joanna) ; Jantas, D (Jantas, Danuta) ; Barbara, Z (Barbara, Ziolkowska) ; Przewlocki, R (Przewlocki, Ryszard)","Title":"Transcriptional signatures of steroid hormones in the striatal neurons and astrocytes"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Editorial Material Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398654600002 PubMed ID: 28424624 ISSN: 1663-9812","Keywords":"calcium activated potassium channel; skeletal muscle; splicing isoforms; periodic paralysis; acetazolamide; dichlorphenamide KeyWords Plus:SENSITIVE K+ CHANNELS; RAT SKELETAL-MUSCLE; POTASSIUM CHANNELS; DEPLETED RATS; ATP CHANNEL; CHANNELOPATHIES; EXCITABILITY; INVOLVEMENT; DEFICIENT; SUBUNITS","Categories":"Pharmacology & Pharmacy Web of Science Categories:Pharmacology & Pharmacy","Journal Information":"FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY Volume: 8 Article Number: 188 DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2017.00188 Published: APR 5 2017","Authors":"Tricarico, D (Tricarico, Domenico) ; Mele, A (Mele, Antonietta)","Title":"Commentary: A BK (Slo1) channel journey from molecule to physiology"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Review Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398637500001 PubMed ID: 28424632 ISSN: 1664-042X","Keywords":"insulin; insulin receptor; angiogenesis; endothelial cells KeyWords Plus:ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR; RETINAL BARRIER BREAKDOWN; DIABETIC-RETINOPATHY; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; RECEPTOR ISOFORMS; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; SIGNALING PATHWAYS; GLYCEMIC CONTROL; PROSTATE-CANCER; GENE-EXPRESSION","Categories":"Physiology Web of Science Categories:Physiology","Journal Information":"FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY Volume: 8 Article Number: 204 DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2017.00204 Published: APR 5 2017","Abstract":"The underlying molecular mechanisms involve in the regulation of the angiogenic process by insulin are not well understood.

Functional expression of insulin receptors and their signaling pathways has been described on endothelial cells and pericytes, both of the main cells involved in vessel formation and maturation. Consequently, insulin has been shown to regulate endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and in vitro tubular structure formation through binding to its receptors and activation of intracellular phosphorylation cascades. Furthermore, insulin-mediated pro-angiogenic state is potentiated by generation of vascular growth factors, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor, produced by endothelial cells. Additionally, diseases such as insulin resistance, obesity, diabetes, and cancer may be associated with the deregulation of insulin-mediated angiogenesis.

Several species of nocturnal insects exhibit complex visually guided behaviour in conditions where most animals are practically blind. The compound eyes of nocturnal insects produce strong responses to single photons and process them into meaningful neural signals, which are amplified by specialized neuroanatomical structures. While a lot is known about the light responses and the anatomical structures that promote pooling of responses to increase sensitivity, there is still a dearth of knowledge on the physiology of night vision. Retinal photoreceptors form the first bottleneck for the transfer of visual information. In this review, we cover the basics of what is known about physiological adaptations of insect photoreceptors for low-light vision. We will also discuss major enigmas of some of the functional properties of nocturnal photoreceptors, and describe recent advances in methodologies that may help to solve them and broaden the field of insect vision research to new model animals.

Previous studies have suggested that the calibration of these scores may vary across countries, centers, and/or characteristics of patients. In the present study, we aimed to assess determinants of the calibration of these scores. Methods: We assessed the calibration of the SAPS II and SAPS 3 scores among 5266 patients admitted to ICUs during a 4-week period at 120 centers in 17 European countries. We obtained calibration curves, Brier scores, and standardized mortality ratios. Points attributed to SAPS items were reevaluated and compared with those of the original scores. Finally, we tested associations between the calibration and center characteristics. Results: The mortality was overestimated by both scores: The standardized mortality ratios were 0.75 (95% CI 0.71-0. 79) for the SAPS II score and 0.91 (95% CI 0.86-0.96) for the SAPS 3 score. This overestimation was partially explained by changes in associations between some items of the scores and mortality, especially the heart rate, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and diagnosis of AIDS for SAPS II. The calibration of both scores was better in countries with low health expenditures. The between-center variability in calibration curves was much greater than expected by chance. Conclusions: Both scores overestimate current mortality among European ICU patients. The magnitude of the miscalibration of SAPS II and SAPS 3 scores depends not only on patient characteristics but also on center characteristics. Furthermore, much between-center variability in calibration remains unexplained by these factors.","Authors":"Poncet, A (Poncet, Antoine) ; Perneger, TV (Perneger, Thomas V.) ; Merlani, P (Merlani, Paolo) ; Capuzzo, M (Capuzzo, Maurizia) ; Combescure, C (Combescure, Christophe)","Title":"Determinants of the calibration of SAPS II and SAPS 3 mortality scores in intensive care: a European multicenter study"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398646500007 PubMed ID: 28267915 ISSN: 0013-936X eISSN: 1520-5851","Categories":"Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences","Journal Information":"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY Volume: 51 Issue: 7 Pages: 3640-3648 DOI: 10.1021/acs.est.6b05138 Published: APR 4 2017","Abstract":"Echinoderms are considered particularly sensitive to ocean acidification (OA) as their skeleton is made of high-magnesium calcite, one of the most soluble forms of calcium carbonate.

Test plates of both species were not affected by dissolution. The spines of E. tribuloides showed no mechanical effects at pH(SW-T)T 7.4 despite having traces of corrosion on secondary spines. On the contrary, spines of the T. ventricosus were significantly etched at both pH(SW-T) 7.7 and 7.4 and their fracture force reduced by 16 to 35%, respectively.

We determined the complete genome sequence of laboratory E. coli strain RR1 (HB101 RecA (+)), which has long been used as a general cloning host. A hybrid genome sequence of K-12 MG1655 and B BL21(DE3) was constructed based on the initial mapping of Illumina HiSeq reads to each reference, and iterative rounds of read mapping, variant detection, and consensus extraction were carried out. Finally, PCR and Sanger sequencing-based finishing were applied to resolve non-single nucleotide variant regions with aberrant read depths and breakpoints, most of them resulting from prophages and insertion sequence transpositions that are not present in the reference genome sequence. We found that 96.9% of the RR1 genome is derived from K-12, and identified exact crossover junctions between K-12 and B genomic fragments. However, because RR1 has experienced a series of genetic manipulations since branching from the common ancestor, it has a set of mutations different from those found in K-12 MG1655. As well as identifying all known genotypes of RR1 on the basis of genomic context, we found novel mutations.

We evaluated the cognitive and neurosensory effects on ultra-endurance athletes during the Transpyrenea(866 Km, 65,000m positive slope), held on the French Pyrenees. Materials and Methods: 40 athletes were enrolled (age 43.8 +/- 8.8 years; 36 males). Olfactory and cognitive tests were performed before the race (T0, n = 40), at 166 kms (T1, n = 28), at 418 kms (T2, n = 20), and after the race (T3, 866 kms, n = 13). The effect of dehydration and sleep deprivation on cognitive features were also studied. Results: Olfactory function decreased during the race (T0: 24.9 +/- 4.3 vs. T3: 22.8 +/- 3.5, z = - 2.678, p = 0.007), language fluency increased (T0: 10.8 +/- 2.9; T1: 11.4 +/- 2.7; T2: 12.9 +/- 2.8; T3: 12.9 +/- 3.0; $ 2 = 11.132, p = 0.011 for combined samples), whereas the Trail Making Test did not show any changes between pre-and post-race (T0 vs. T3 p = 0.697 for TMT- A, p = 0.977 for TMT- B). The mean aggregate sleeping time was 9.3 +/- 5.4 h at T1, 22.4 +/- 10.0 h at T2, 29.5 +/- 20.5 h at T3, with a correlation with olfactory function (r = 0.644, p = 0.018), while Total Body Water (TBW) was not correlated with olfactory or cognitive scores. Conclusion: Physical activity and sleep restriction in ultra-endurance could transiently affect olfactory function, while verbal fluency improved, demonstrating a dissimilar mechanism of activation/deactivation in different cortical areas. Body water loss was uncorrelated to cognition. Further studies should clarify whether cognitive and sensory deficits occur even in absence of sleep restriction.","Authors":"Tonacci, A (Tonacci, Alessandro) ; Mrakic-Sposta, S (Mrakic-Sposta, Simona) ; Ujka, K (Ujka, Kristian) ; Sansone, F (Sansone, Francesco) ; Ferrisi, A (Ferrisi, Alice) ; Giardini, G (Giardini, Guido) ; Conte, R (Conte, Raffaele) ; Pratali, L (Pratali, Lorenza)","Title":"Neurosensory and Cognitive Modifications in Europe's Toughest RandoRaid Competition: the Transpyrenea Extreme Study"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397351200007 PubMed ID: 28189053 ISSN: 0168-1605 eISSN: 1879-3460","Keywords":"K lactis; RNAseq; Non-Saccharomyces; Aerobic fermentation; Oxidative stress KeyWords Plus:NON-SACCHAROMYCES YEAST; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS; ALCOHOL CONTENT; RNA PSEUDOURIDYLATION; MESSENGER-RNA; GENE; CEREVISIAE; STRAINS; RESPIRATION; DELETIONS","Categories":"Food Science & Technology; Microbiology Web of Science Categories:Food Science & Technology; Microbiology","Journal Information":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY Volume: 246 Pages: 40-49 DOI: 10.1016/Afoodmicro.2017.01.014 Published: APR 4 2017","Abstract":"The respiratory, metabolism of yeast species alternative to Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been explored in recent years as a tool to reduce ethanol content in grape wine. The efficacy of this strategy has been previously proven for mixed cultures of non-Saccharomyces and S. cerevisiae strains.

Transcriptional changes in K lactis are mainly driven by oxygen limitation, iron requirement, and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress appears as a consequence of the hypoxic conditions achieved by K. lactis once oxygen supply is no longer sufficient to sustain fully respiratory metabolism. This species copes with low oxygen and iron availability by repressing iron consuming pathways and activating iron transport mechanisms. Most of the physiological and transcriptomic features of K lactis in aerobic wine fermentation are not shared with the Crabtree-positive yeast S. cerevisiae.

Partial hepatectomy of the adult mammalian liver activates compensatory hepatocyte hypertrophy and cell division across remaining lobes, resulting in restitution of organ mass but with permanent alteration of architecture. Here, we identify a time window in early postnatal life wherein partial amputation culminates in a localized regeneration instead of global hypertrophy and proliferation. Quantifications of liver mass, enzymatic activity, and immunohistochemistry demonstrate that damaged lobes underwent multilineage regeneration, reforming a lobe often indistinguishable from undamaged ones. Clonal analysis during regeneration reveals local clonal expansions of hepatocyte stem/progenitors at injured sites that are lineage but not fate restricted. Tetrachimeric mice show clonal selection occurs during development with further selections following injury. Surviving progenitors associate mainly with central veins, in a pattern of selection different from that of normal development.

We aimed to describe population-based data on intensive care treated traumatic brain injury in Iceland over 15 years period. MethodsRetrospective review of all intensive care unit admissions due to traumatic brain injury at The National University Hospital of Iceland 1999-2013. Data were collected on demographics, mechanism of injury, alcohol consumption, glasgow come scale upon admission, Injury Severity Scoring, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score, length of stay, interventions and mortality (defined as glasgow outcome score one). All computerized tomography scans were reviewed for Marshall score classification. ResultsIntensive care unit admissions due to traumatic brain injury were 583. The incidence decreased significantly from 14/100.000/year to 12/100.000/year. Males were 72% and the mean age was 41 year. Majority of patients (42%) had severe traumatic brain injury. The most common mechanism of injury was a fall from low heights (36.3%). The mortality was 18.2%. Increasing age, injury severity score, Marshall score and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score are all independent risk factors for death. Glasgow coma scale was not an independent prognostic factor for outcome. ConclusionsIncidence decreased with a shift in injury mechanism from road traffic accidents to falls and an increased rate of traumatic brain injury in older patients following a fall from standing or low heights. Mortality was higher in older patients falling from low heights than in younger patients suffering multiple injuries in road traffic accidents. Age, injury severity score, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score and Marshall score are good prognostic factors for outcome. Traumatic brain injury continues to be a considerable problem and the increase in severe traumatic brain injury in the middle age and older age groups after a seemingly innocent accident needs a special attention.","Authors":"Jonsdottir, GM (Jonsdottir, G.

DBA/2J mice have been shown to be sensitive to the acute anxiolytic effects of alcohol as well as the anxiogenic effects of withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure, while B6 mice are resistant to both. Considering that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is an important brain region for the acute and chronic effects of EtOH on fear and anxiety related behaviors, we hypothesized that there would be strain-dependent differences in the acute effects of EtOH in BLA slices. Methods: We utilized patch clamp electrophysiology in BLA coronal slices from 4 inbred mouse strains (A/J, BALBcJ, C57BL/6J, and DBA/2J) to examine how genetic background influences acute EtOH effects on synaptic vesicle recycling and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) in response to low (2Hz)- and high (40Hz)-frequency stimulation. Results: We found that EtOH inhibited synaptic vesicle recycling in a strain- and stimulation frequency-dependent manner. Vesicle recycling in DBA/2J and BALBcJ cells was inhibited by acute EtOH during both low- and high-frequency stimulation, while recycling measured from A/J cells was sensitive only during high-frequency stimulation. Recycling at C57BL/6J synapses was insensitive to EtOH regardless of stimulation frequency. We additionally found that cells from DBA/2J and BALBcJ mice were sensitive to EtOH-mediated inhibition of PTP. Conclusions: Acute EtOH application inhibited vesicle recycling and PTP at glutamatergic synapses in both a strain- and frequency-dependent fashion. Several presynaptic proteins that contribute to synaptic vesicle priming in addition to PTP have been implicated in alcohol-related behaviors, including Munc13, Munc18, and RIM proteins, making them potential candidates for the molecular mechanism controlling these effects.","Authors":"Gioia, DA (Gioia, Dominic A.) ; McCool, B (McCool, Brian)","Title":"Strain-Dependent Effects of Acute Alcohol on Synaptic Vesicle Recycling and Post-Tetanic Potentiation in Medial Glutamate Inputs to the Mouse Basolateral Amygdala"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397583900014 PubMed ID: 27552353 ISSN: 0894-9115 eISSN: 1537-7385","Keywords":"Tracheostomy; Manometry; Pharyngeal Phase Kinematics; Neurogenic Dysphagia; Rehabilitation KeyWords Plus:UPPER ESOPHAGEAL SPHINCTER; TRACHEOTOMY TUBE; ASPIRATION; SWALLOW; SCALE","Categories":"Rehabilitation; Sport Sciences Web of Science Categories:Rehabilitation; Sport Sciences","Journal Information":"AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION Volume: 96 Issue: 4 Pages: 268-272 DOI: 10.1097/PHM.0000000000000602 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Objective: Tracheostomy tubes (TT) are often needed in patients with severe neurologic injuries to protect the respiratory system from aspiration.

Design: Prospective controlled clinical study with 20 tracheotomized patients after unilateral hemispheric stroke. Pharyngeal manometry and flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing were performed simultaneously to determine pharyngoesophageal pressure and timing, as well as PA scores with open and occluded TTs. In each condition, patients had to swallow 5 mL of puree 5 times. Results: Pharyngoesophageal pressure amplitudes, duration, and timing of the swallows did not change as a result of the tracheostomy tube status. Penetration-aspiration values were significantly lower in the occluded tube condition (P = 0.024). Conclusions: Airflow and tracheostomy tube status did not influence the physiology of pharyngoesophageal swallowing in patients with neurogenic dysphagia.

We used HumMod, a large physiological model, to test hypotheses of blood pressure (BP) salt sensitivity. Systemic hemodynamics, renal, and neurohormonal responses to chronic changes in salt intake were examined during normal renal function, fixed low or high plasma angiotensin II (ANG II) levels, bilateral renal artery stenosis, increased renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), and decreased nephron numbers. Simulations were run for 4 wk at salt intakes ranging from 30 to 1,000 mmol/day. Reducing functional kidney mass or fixing ANG II increased salt sensitivity. Salt sensitivity, associated with inability of ANG II to respond to changes in salt intake, occurred with smaller changes in renal blood flow but greater changes in glomerular filtration rate, renal sodium reabsorption, and total peripheral resistance (TPR). However, clamping TPR at normal or high levels had no major effect on salt sensitivity. There were no clear relationships between BP salt sensitivity and renal vascular resistance or extracellular fluid volume. Our robust mathematical model of cardiovascular, renal, endocrine, and sympathetic nervous system physiology supports the hypothesis that specific types of kidney dysfunction, associated with impaired regulation of ANG II or increased tubular sodium reabsorption, contribute to BP salt sensitivity. However, increased preglomerular resistance, increased RSNA, or inability to decrease TPR does not appear to influence salt sensitivity. This model provides a platform for testing competing concepts of long-term BP control during changes in salt intake.","Authors":"Clemmer, JS (Clemmer, John S.) ; Pruett, WA (Pruett, W.

In this study we use GC-MS based metabolomics to describe the metabolite profiles of foods consumed by one population of Mexican black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) over a 10-month period. Our data indicate that each food exhibited a distinct metabolite profile, and the average weekly intake of metabolites such as neochlorogenic acid and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) was correlated with the consumption of certain plant parts. We speculate that these patterns result in temporal changes in howler monkey physiology such as food retention time. In contrast, variation in the weekly intake of metabolites such as oxalic acid was70% less than variation in the concentration of the same metabolites across food items, suggesting that howler monkeys regulated the intake of these metabolites, possibly to avoid physiological consequences such as kidney stone formation. Finally, seasonal variation in the consumption of individual nutrient and non-nutrient metabolites were correlated with changes in the relative abundances of associated gut microbial taxa, implying indirect effects of food item metabolites on howler monkey nutritional ecology that likely drive foraging decisions.

Historically, studies of primate feeding ecology have focused on characterizing diets in terms of the botanical composition of the plants consumed. Further, dietary studies have demonstrated how patch and food choice in relation to time spent foraging and feeding are influenced by the spatial and temporal distribution of resources and by social factors such as feeding competition, dominance, or partner preferences. From a nutritional perspective, several theories including energy and protein-to-fiber maximization, nutrient mixing, and toxin avoidance, have been proposed to explain the food choices of non-human primates. However, more recently, analytical frameworks such as nutritional geometry have been incorporated into primatology to explore, using a multivariate approach, the synergistic effects of multiple nutrients, secondary metabolites, and energy requirements on primate food choice. Dietary strategies associated with nutrient balancing highlight the tradeoffs that primates face in bypassing or selecting particular feeding sites and food items. In this Special Issue, the authors bring together a set of studies focusing on the nutritional ecology of a diverse set of primate taxa characterized by marked differences in dietary emphasis. The authors present, compare, and discuss the diversity of strategies used by primates in diet selection, and how species differences in ecology, physiology, anatomy, and phylogeny can affect patterns of nutrient choice and nutrient balancing. The use of a nutritionally explicit analytical framework is fundamental to identify the nutritional requirements of different individuals of a given species, and through its application, direct conservation efforts can be applied to regenerate and protect specific foods and food patches that offer the opportunity of a nutritionally balanced diet.","Authors":"Righini, N (Righini, Nicoletta)","Title":"Recent advances in primate nutritional ecology"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396346900005 ISSN: 0954-1020 eISSN: 1365-2079","Keywords":"feather corticosterone; glucocorticoids; haematocrit; migration; testosterone; triglycerides KeyWords Plus:GRAY-HEADED ALBATROSSES; EGG-PRODUCTION; DIOMEDEA-MELANOPHRIS; BODY CONDITION; CLUTCH SIZE; CORTICOSTERONE; CHRYSOSTOMA; MIGRATION; FEATHERS; DECISIONS","Categories":"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Physical Geography; Geology Web of Science Categories:Environmental Sciences; Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary","Journal Information":"ANTARCTIC SCIENCE Volume: 29 Issue: 2 Pages: 155-164 DOI: 10.1017/S0954102016000560 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"We investigated the physiology of two closely related albatross species relative to their breeding strategy: black-browed albatrosses (Thalassarche melanophris) breed annually, while grey-headed albatrosses (T. chrysostoma) breed biennially.

Correlations between post-breeding physiology and fCort, and links to future breeding decisions, were examined. In black-browed albatrosses, post-breeding physiology and fCort were not significantly correlated, but fCort independently predicted breeding decision the next year, which we interpret as a possible migratory carry-over effect. In grey-headed albatrosses, post-breeding triglyceride levels were negatively correlated with fCort, but only in females, which we interpret as a potential cost of reproduction. However, this potential cost did not carry-over to future breeding in the grey-headed albatrosses. None of the variables predicted future breeding decisions.

Basking is the primary mechanism used by many freshwater turtles to maintain their body temperature (Tb) in a range that maximizes physiological performance. Basking turtles are easily disturbed by motorboats, but the consequences of the increasingly popular use of motorboats on turtles is largely unknown. 2. In this work, predictive models built from field and laboratory data were used to assess the effects of the frequency of basking disturbance by motorboats on Tb and metabolic rate (MR) of female northern map turtles (Graptemys geographica), a species of conservation concern. 3. Simulations revealed that the effects of boat disturbance vary seasonally. In early May, a conservative estimate of the disturbance rate (0.15 per hour) resulted in a 0.34 degrees C decrease in mean daily Tb, which translated to a 7.8% reduction in mean MR. In June, July and August, owing to warmer lake temperatures, the effect of disturbance was less marked and the observed disturbance rates (0.32, 0.96 and 1.23 per hour, respectively) reduced the mean MR of an adult female by 2.1%, 0.5%, and 0.4 %, respectively. 4. Reduction in MR decreases the rate of energy assimilation, which could translate into sublethal effects on turtles, such as reduced growth and reproductive output. 5. Motorboat usage is increasing in many areas and is probably affecting other species of freshwater turtles that use aerial basking. This study offers important insights on the implications of disturbances for species that bask. Copyright # 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Authors":"Jain-Schlaepfer, SMR (Jain-Schlaepfer, Sofia M.

We measured and detected sucralose (an artificial sweetener), fluoxetine (an antidepressant), and other PPCP in the Portneuf River in Idaho, USA, where Lemna minor (an aquatic plant in the environment and used in ecotoxicology studies) naturally occurs. Sucralose was hypothesized to negatively affect photosynthesis and growth of L. minor because sucralose is a chlorinated molecule that may be toxic or unusable for plant metabolism. A priori hypotheses were not created for fluoxetine due to lack of previous studies examining its impacts on plants. We conducted laboratory ecotoxicological assessments for a large range of concentrations of sucralose and fluoxetine on L. minor physiology and photosynthetic function. Frond green leaf area, root length, growth rate, photosynthetic capacity, and plant carbon isotopic composition (discrimination relative to a standard; delta C-13) were measured among treatments ranging from 0 to 15000 nmol/L-sucralose and 0-323 nmol/L-fluoxetine. Contrary to our predictions, sucralose significantly increased green leaf area, photosynthetic capacity, and delta C-13 of L. minor at environmentally relevant concentrations. The increase of delta C-13 from sucralose amendments and an isotope-mixing model indicated substantial sucralose uptake and assimilation within the plant. Unlike humans who cannot break down and utilize sucralose, we documented that L. minor a mixotrophic plant can use sucralose as a sugar substitute to increase its green leaf area and photosynthetic capacity. Fluoxetine significantly decreased L. minor root growth, daily growth rate, and asexual reproduction at 323 nmol/L-fluoxetine; however, ambiguity remains regarding the mechanisms responsible and the applicability of these extreme concentrations unprecedented in the natural environment. To our knowledge, this was the first study to show aquatic plants can uptake and metabolize sucralose as a carbon source. This study further supports the common notion that L. minor can be useful in bioremediation of PPCP from wastewaters. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study evaluated the toxic effects of microinjecting purified Pacific ciguatoxin-1 (P-CTX-1) on embryonic development of marine medaka Oryzias melastigma. A lower 96 h-LD50 value was estimated for eleutheroembryos (1.32 ng g(-1)) than that for embryos (1.71 ng g(-1)), indicating that P-CTX-1 is more lethal to newly hatched medaka larvae. P-CTX-1 induced detrimental effects during embryonic development, including hatching failure, abnormalities in physical development (caudal fin malformation and spinal deformities), internal damage (green coloration of the gall bladder and hemorrhaging), immune dysfunction, and altered muscle physiology (bradycardia and hyperkinetic twitching). The results of a transcriptional expression analysis of genes related to the stress/immune responses, cardiac and bone development, and apoptosis supported the observed developmental abnormalities.

In birds, plumage coloration is often linked to individual quality, but less research has investigated coloration in unfeathered traits (i.e. 'bare parts'), despite theoretical expectations that they might be more reliable signals. Here, we investigate the relationship between multiple ornaments and social dominance in a wild population of the cooperatively breeding Australian Swamphen (known locally as and hereafter referred to as Pukeko; Porphyrio melanotus melanotus) to test the hypothesis that barepart ornaments should be more strongly correlated with dominance than plumage coloration. We show that the size and color of the pukeko's frontal shield (a bare-part ornament), as well as the brightness and chroma of the blue-UV breast plumage, are correlated with social dominance in adult birds. However, the correlation between frontal shield size and dominance was much higher than that between plumage color and dominance, and was also higher than most previously published correlations between plumage traits and dominance. Additionally, frontal shield size, but not breast coloration, was correlated with the size of the testes in male pukekos, which may be because bare-part ornaments are more closely tied to an individual's current physiology than plumage ornaments. While correlative, our results demonstrate that bare-part and plumage traits could act as redundant ornaments, but with differing reliability, and suggest that future studies on bare-part ornaments will enhance our understanding of dominance signaling.

The machineries which functionally connect tight and AJ to the cytoskeleton comprise proteins which either bind directly to cytoskeletal filaments, or function as adaptors for regulators of the assembly and function of the cytoskeleton. In the last two decades, specific cytoskeleton-associated junctional molecules have been implicated in mechanotransduction, revealing the existence of multimolecular complexes that can sense mechanical cues and translate them into adaptation to tensile forces and biochemical signals.

Therefore, we evaluated the sensitivity of cardiac function for geometry and myofiber orientation in a biventricular (BiV) finite element model of cardiac mechanics. Starting out from a reference geometry in which myofiber orientation had no transmural component, two new geometries were defined with either a 27 % decrease in LV short- to long-axis ratio, or a 16 % decrease of RV length, but identical LV and RV cavity and wall volumes. These variations in geometry caused differences in both local myofiber and global pump work below 6 %. Variation of fiber orientation was induced through adaptive myofiber reorientation that caused an average change in fiber orientation of similar to 8(circle) predominantly through the formation of a component in transmural direction. Reorientation caused a considerable increase in local myofiber (similar to 18 %) work and in global pump work (similar to 17 %) in all three geometries, while differences between geometries were below 5 %. The findings suggest that implementing a realistic myofiber orientation is at least as important as defining a patient-specific geometry.

Current in vitro models of the trabecular meshwork are oversimplified and do not capture the organized and complex three-dimensional nature of this tissue that consists primarily of collagen and glycoasaminoglycans. In this work, collagen and collagen-chondroitin sulfate (CS) scaffolds were fabricated via unidirectional freezing and lyophilization to induce the formation of aligned pores. Scaffolds were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis, and a chondroitin sulfate quantification assay. Scaffold characterization confirmed the formation of aligned pores, and also that the CS was leaching out of the scaffolds over time. Primary porcine trabecular meshwork (TM) cells were seeded onto the surface of scaffolds and their gene expression, proliferation, viability, migration into the scaffolds, and morphology were examined. The TM cells were viable and proliferated 2 weeks after seeding. The cells migrated down into the internal scaffold structure and their morphology reflected the topography and alignment of the scaffold structure. This work is a promising step toward the development of a three dimensional in vitro model of the TM that can be used for testing of glaucoma pharmacological agents in future experimentation and to better our understanding of the trabecular meshwork and its complex physiology.

Researchers and clinicians typically rely on the mean measure of ABP; however, there is considerable variability in the beat-to-beat BP. Although often ignored, this variability has been found to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality. The aim of this paper is to provide a conceptual review of ABP variability (ABPV) focusing on the following: associations between ABPV and health, whether ABPV is reliable, how to calculate ABPV, predictors of ABPV, and treatments for ABPV. Two future directions are discussed involving better understanding ABPV by momentary assessments and improving knowledge of the underlying physiology that explains ABPV. The results of this review suggest that the unique characteristics of ABPV provide insight into the role of BP variability in hypertension and subsequent cardiovascular illness.

Moreover, NREM sleep is thought to selectively benefit associations that are adaptive for the future. In line with this, the current study investigated whether different reward cues at encoding are associated with changes in sleep physiology and memory retention. Participants' associative memory was tested after learning a list of arbitrarily paired words both before and after taking a 90-min nap. During learning, word-pairs were preceded by a cue indicating either a high or a low reward for correct memory performance at test. The motivation manipulation successfully impacted retention such that memory declined to a greater extent from pre- to post sleep for low rewarded than for high rewarded word-pairs. In line with previous studies, positive correlations between spindle density during NREM sleep and general memory performance pre- and post-sleep were found. In addition to this, however, a selective positive relationship between memory performance for highly rewarded word-pairs at posttest and spindle density during NREM sleep was also observed. These results support the view that motivationally salient memories are preferentially consolidated and that sleep spindles may be an important underlying mechanism for selective consolidation.

To determine the physiological requirement for de novo endothelial cell BH4 synthesis for the vasomotor function of resistance arteries, we have generated a mouse model with endothelial cell-specific deletion of Gch1, encoding GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GTPCH), an essential enzyme for BH4 biosynthesis, and evaluated BH4-dependent eNOS regulation, eNOS-derived NO and ROS generation. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH The reactivity of mouse second-order mesenteric arteries was assessed by wire myography. High performance liquid chromatography was used to determine BH4, BH2 and biopterin. Western blotting was used for expression analysis. KEY RESULTS Gch1(fl/fl) Tie2cre mice demonstrated reduced GTPCH protein and BH4 levels in mesenteric arteries. Deficiency in endothelial cell BH4 leads to eNOS uncoupling, increased ROS production and loss of NO generation in mesenteric arteries of Gch1 fl/ fl Tie2cre mice. Gch1(fl/fl) Tie2cre mesenteric arteries had enhanced vasoconstriction to U46619 and phenylephrine, which was abolished by L-NAME. Endothelium-dependent vasodilatations to ACh and SLIGRL were impaired in mesenteric arteries from Gch1 fl/ fl Tie2cre mice, compared with those from wild-type littermates. Loss of eNOS-derived NO-mediated vasodilatation was associated with increased eNOS-derived H2O2 and cyclooxygenase-derived vasodilator in Gch1(fl/ fl) Tie2cre mesenteric arteries. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Endothelial cell Gch1 and BH4-dependent eNOS regulation play pivotal roles in maintaining vascular homeostasis in resistance arteries. Therefore, targeting vascular Gch1 and BH4 biosynthesis may provide a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of microvascular dysfunction in patients with cardiovascular disease.","Authors":"Chuaiphichai, S (Chuaiphichai, Surawee) ; Crabtree, MJ (Crabtree, Mark J.) ; Mcneill, E (Mcneill, Eileen) ; Hale, AB (Hale, Ashley B.) ; Trelfa, L (Trelfa, Lucy) ; Channon, KM (Channon, Keith M.) ; Douglas, G (Douglas, Gillian)","Title":"A key role for tetrahydrobiopterin- dependent endothelial NOS regulation in resistance arteries: studies in endothelial cell tetrahydrobiopterin-deficient mice"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396826900002 PubMed ID: 27573159 ISSN: 0007-4853 eISSN: 1475-2670","Keywords":"Bovine insulin; ILPs; reproduction; Chrysopa septempunctata KeyWords Plus:SILKMOTH BOMBYX-MORI; JUVENILE-HORMONE; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; DIGESTIVE PHYSIOLOGY; SIGNALING PATHWAY; GENE-EXPRESSION; AEDES-AEGYPTI; DROSOPHILA; MOSQUITO; INSECTS","Categories":"Entomology Web of Science Categories:Entomology","Journal Information":"BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH Volume: 107 Issue: 2 Pages: 148-154 DOI: 10.1017/S0007485316000742 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Insulin-like peptides (ILPs) act through a conserved insulin signaling pathway and play crucial roles in insect metabolism, growth, reproduction, and aging.

The regulation of blood pressure is multifactorial reflecting genetic susceptibility, in utero environment and external factors such as obesity and salt intake. In keeping with Arthur Guyton's hypothesis, the kidney plays a key role in blood pressure control and data from clinical studies; physiology and genetics have shown that hypertension is driven a failure of the kidney to excrete excess salt at normal levels of blood pressure. There is a number of rare Mendelian blood pressure syndromes, which have shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in dysregulated ion transport in the distal kidney. One in particular is Familial hyperkalemic hypertension (FHHt), an autosomal dominant monogenic form of hypertension characterised by high blood pressure, hyperkalemia, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and hypercalciuria. The clinical signs of FHHt are treated by low doses of thiazide diuretic, and it mirrors Gitelman syndrome which features the inverse phenotype of hypotension, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, and hypocalciuria. Gitelman syndrome is caused by loss of function mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na/Cl cotransporter (NCC); however, FHHt patients do not have mutations in the SCL12A3 locus encoding NCC. Instead, mutations have been identified in genes that have revealed a key signalling pathway that regulates NCC and several other key transporters and ion channels in the kidney that are critical for BP regulation. This is the WNK kinase signalling pathway that is the subject of this review.","Authors":"Murthy, M (Murthy, Meena) ; Kurz, T (Kurz, Thimo) ; O'Shaughnessy, KM (O'Shaughnessy, Kevin M.)","Title":"WNK signalling pathways in blood pressure regulation"}]
