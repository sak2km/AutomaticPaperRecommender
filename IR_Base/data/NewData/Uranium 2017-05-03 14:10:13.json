The mixed photocatalysts exhibit a double-layer configuration with crystalline structures of CuO and CuFeO2. On irradiation of the CuO/CuFeO2 electrodes (held at 0.5 V vs. SCE) with solar simulated light (air mass 1.5;100 mW cm(-2)), the U(VI) concentration decreases with time, while the total amount of uranium in solution does not change. This indicates that virtually all conversion reactions of U(VI) occur in the bulk solution, while surface reactions are limited due to insignificant adsorption of U(VI). U(VI) conversion leads to the mixed production of lower oxidation states U4+, u(14/3+), and U16/3+ at a ratio of 42:28:30, with an overall Faradaic efficiency of similar to 98%. The kinetics and induction time for U(VI) conversion are significantly influenced by the conditions of photocatalyst synthesis (CuO/CuFeO2, CuO, and CuFeO2; ED times of 2-4h), the applied potential value (-0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 V vs. SCE), and the seawater condition (air-equilibrated vs. N-2-purged; pH 3-10.4). Based on the obtained results, 02 is proposed to play a key role in shuttling photogenerated electrons between the electrodes and U(VI). In addition, the existence of an induction time is discussed in terms of material and reaction pathway. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Organic matter-consuming organisms like invertebrate shredders, grazers, and bioturbators significantly affect element fixation or remobilization by changing redox conditions or binding properties of organic sediments. Little is known about the effect of filter feeders, like the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, an invasive organism in North American and European freshwater ecosystems. A laboratory batch experiment exposing D. polymorpha\" (similar to 1200 organisms per m(2\\)) to organic sediment from a site contaminated with arsenic, copper, lead, and uranium revealed a significant uptake and accumulation of arsenic, copper, iron, and especially uranium both into the soft body tissues and the seashell. This is in line with previous observations of metal(loid) accumulation from biomonitoring studies. Regarding its environmental impact, D. polymorpha significantly contributed to mobilization of 'silicon, iron, phosphorus, arsenic, and copper and to immobilization of uranium (p < 0.001), probably driven by redox conditions, microbial activity within the gut system, or active control of element homeostasis. No net mobilization or immobilization was observed for zinc and lead, because of their low mobility at the prevailing pH of 7.5-8.5. The present results suggest that D. polymorpha can both ameliorate (nutrient mobilization, immobilization of toxicants mobile under oxic conditions) or aggravate negative effects (mobilization of toxicants mobile under reducing conditions) in ecosystems. Relating the results of the present study to observed population densities in natural freshwater ecosystems suggests a significant influence of D. polymorpha on element cycling and needs to be considered in future studies.

Several procedures have been developed to recover and re-use P resulting in a growing number of recycling fertilizers that are currently not regulated in terms of fertilizer efficiency. We tested various materials and matrices for their total P content, solubility of P in neutral ammonium citrate (Pnac) and water, and performed robustness tests to check if existing analytical methods are suitable for those new materials. Digestion with inverse aqua regia was best suited to determine the total P content. Pnac sample preparation and analyses were feasible for all matrices. However, we found significant time and temperature dependencies, especially for materials containing organic matter. Furthermore, several materials didn't reach equilibrium during the extractions.

In particular, a thorium-uranium fuel cycle is considered to remove the heterogeneity of the fuel assemblies for design simplification and to improve the core performance parameters by selectively adding thorium into both blanket and driver fuels. The results show that the use of TRU nuclides from PWR spent fuel leads to significant extension of the fuel cycle length, but considerable increase of burnup reactivity swing. In addition, these results also indicate that the uranium-thorium mixed fuels both in the lower blanket and driver considerably improve the inherent safety of the ultra-long-cycle core by reducing burnup reactivity and sodium void worth; this makes it possible to simplify the previous heterogeneous fuel assembly design with improved core performances.

The contaminated sediments reported leachable contents of U between 22.85 and 2700 mu g/g and those of Th between 4.800 and 102.1 mu g/g, which exceed by a few to several hundred times the respective content found in the background. Generally, the leachable U and Th contents in the stream sediments decrease with distance from the potential contamination sources. A special case is the runoff gathering reservoir located around 1 km downstream of the U mine-site, representing the most severe metal contamination hotspot within the alpine watershed, where the highest leachable content of U and Th in the inlet sediment was observed. The highest leachability of U (68.6%) and Th (44.8%) was observed in this sediment as well, indicating a high potential of bioaccumulation and bioconcentration of U and Th under changing geochemical conditions. Correlations analysis indicates that the dilute HCl leachable fraction of U and Th bound in the sediments are strongly dependent on anthropogenic inputs from the U mining/milling activities, and Ca salts are the main vectors.

At 6 MW, it delivers neutron flux and energy spectrum comparable to light water reactor (LWR) power reactors in a compact core using highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel. In the framework of nonproliferation policy, the international community aims to minimize the use of HEU in civilian facilities. Within this context, research and test reactors have started a program to convert HEU fuel to low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel. A new type of LEU fuel based on a high density alloy of uranium and molybdenum (U-10Mo) is expected to allow the conversion of U.S. domestic high performance reactors like MITR. The current study focuses on the impacts of MITR Maximum Hypothetical Accident (MHA), which is also the Design Basis Accident (DBA), with LEU fuel.

Its isotopic composition is here described by a single real number referred to as the Pu grade. Plutonium flows through both reactor types are characterized by using linear functions of the Pu grade in new fuels. These functions have been determined by fitting data from a former scenario study carried out with the COSI6 simulation software. Two different reprocessing strategies are considered. With joint reprocessing of all spent fuels, total and fissile plutonium flows balance for a unique fraction x of EPR (TM) in the fleet, equal to 0.2547. This x value is consistent with the results reported in the former scenario study mentioned above.

In some ways, the organo-f-element chemistry published in 2016 differs from that of previous years. For example, gasphase reactions of laser-vaporized lanthanide atoms with small unsaturated organic molecules have been the subject of several interesting experimental and theoretical studies. Various unstable homoleptic and heteroleptic gas-phase species have been generated that way and studied by spectroscopic methods. Notable in this area are e. g. the methylene derivative CH2CeF2, the ceracyclopropene Ce(C2H2), the perdeuterated yttrium phenyl cation [Y(C6D5)](+), and unusual scandium carbonyl complexes such as OScCO and OCScCO3. Remarkable divalent lanthanide alkyls and carbene complexes have also been described in 2016. A continuing trend for many years which continued into 2016 was the investigation of highly reactive lanthanide alkyl complexes supported by non-cyclopentadienyl ligands (e. g. amidinates, beta-diketiminates etc.). Many of these complexes found useful applications in homogeneous catalysis. Interesting reactivities have been reported e. g. for the first non-pincer-type mononuclear scandium alkylidene complexes and a series of mixed methyl/methylidene trinuclear rare-earth metal complexes. The isolation, structure and reactivity of a unique scandium boryl oxycarbene complex as well as the first molecular polyarsenides of the rare-earth elements have also been reported. Several examples of macrocyclic compounds (\"giant lanthanide wheels\") have been prepared with the use of specially designed Nchelating ligands. New chemistry has been developed around \"samarocene oxide\", Cp/2Sm-O-Cp/2 (Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) which is generally considered as an undesired decomposition product of the highly air-sensitive divalent samarocene Cp-2*Sm(THF) 2, and novel 1,1'-diphospaplumbocenes have been synthesized and subsequently employed as phospholyl ligand transfer reagents in organothulium chemistry. Synthesis and derivative chemistry of an Yb(II) triple-decker complex with the l-bridging naphthalene dianion have been investigated, including in formation of an unusual trinuclear Yb(II) complex with a l-bridging P-7(3) ligand. The cyclooctatetraenyl dianion (COT) continued to be a versatile building block for the synthesis of new half-sandwich, sandwich, and inverse sandwich complexes. Significant progress has also been made in the field of endohedral metallofullerenes, including the synthesis and characterization of an unusual non-isolated pentagon rule metallic carbide clusterfullerene containing a seven-membered ring, Sc2C2@C-s(hept)-C-88. In the field of heterometallic organolanthanide complexes, novel inclusion complexes of the composition (Cp/2Yb) 2(Cp2M) (Cp = cyclopentadienyl; M = V, Cr, Fe, and Co) have been isolated in the solid state. Once again, an impressive number of interesting contributions have been published in 2016 in the field of organolanthanide catalysis, with an emphasis on Ln-catalyzed olefin and diene polymerization. Unusual new Ln-catalyzed reactions included, among others, the simultaneous chain-growth and step-growth polymerization of meta-and para-methoxystyrene, the production of Si-H-containing syndiotactic polystyrene by the direct polymerization of 4-vinylphenyldimethylsilane, the formation of poly(2vinylpyridine) with highly isotactic and high-molecular-weight characteristics, and the C-H polyaddition of dimethoxyarenes to unconjugated dienes such as norbornadiene and 1,4-divinylbenzene. Moreover, the efficient and selective Ln-catalyzed ortho-alkylation of tertiary amines via C-H addition to alkenes has been achieved for the first time. In organoactinide chemistry, new homoleptic uranium(III) and thorium(IV) alkyl and aryl complexes have been synthesized and established as potential starting materials in organoactinide chemistry. These include e. g. U[g4-Me2NC(H)C6H5](3) and [Li(DME)(3)](2)[Th(C6H5)(6)]. Novel uranium(IV)-carbene-imido complexes and a uranium(IV)-carbene-imido-amide metalla-allene have also been reported in 2016, and the chemistry of new molecular complexes of U2+ has been further developed. The thorium(III) complex Cp '' 3Th (Cp '' = C5H3(SiMe3)(2)-1,3) has been reported to reacts with P4 to give (eta-g(1): eta(1)-P-4)[Cp '' 3Th](2), which has an unprecedented cyclo-P-4 binding mode. Moreover, various new and unusual transformations have been achieved using the Cp-2*Th platform, including the chemistry of the metallacyclopropene Cp-2*U[eta(2)-C-2(SiMe3)(2)], the generation of new phospha-and arsaazaallene thorium metallocenes, and the synthesis of the first thorium-copper heterobimetallic compounds. With the use of bulky cyclooctatetraenyl ligands, the synthesis and characterisation of novel U(V) oxo and nitrido complexes has been achieved. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Reliable interpretation of sedimentary isotopic information requires a thorough understanding of the environmental controls on isotopic fractionation in modern anoxic environments before being applied to the paleo-record. In this study, the relationship between ocean anoxia and the isotopic fractionation of U was investigated in the water column and sediments of the Black Sea, the world's largest anoxic basin. Paired measurements of U-238/U-235 and U concentration, supported by other redox parameters, were obtained for water column and sediment samples collected during the 2013 GA04N GEOTRACES expedition to the Black Sea. Removal of U from the water column occurs during the redox transition of soluble U(VI) to relatively insoluble U(IV), resulting in up to 43% of U being removed from solution in euxinic bottom waters. Uranium reduction and removal is accompanied by a progressive shift in U-238/U-235 towards isotopically light values in the water column as heavier 238 U is preferentially exported to sediments over lighter 235 U. This gives rise to apparent isotope enrichment factors of epsilon = -0.63 +/- 0.09% and epsilon = -0.84 +/- 0.11% when U removal is modelled by Rayleigh and closed system equilibrium isotope fractionation, respectively. These e values fall within the range determined for bacterial U reduction experiments, and together with a striking correlation between the distributions of U and H2S, implicate microbially-mediated U(VI)-U(IV) reduction as the primary mechanism controlling U isotopic shifts in the Black Sea. The U-238/U-235 of underlying sediments is related to the the U-238/U-235 of Black Sea bottom waters through the isotope enrichment factor of the U reduction reaction but the relationship between sedimentary and water column U-238/U-235 is complicated by mass transport processes, and the modelled e values may underestimate the true isotope enrichment factors. These new results for the Black Sea provide important constraints on the use of U-238/U-235 as a proxy of the redox state of ancient oceans. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Sedimentary distributions and accumulation rates of the elements were used to evaluate early diagenesis in sediments along this section and to estimate the importance of this margin as a sink for key elements in the polar and global oceans. Distributions of Mn, total S and reduced inorganic S demonstrated that diagenetic conditions and thus sedimentary carbon turnover in the NAAM is organized regionally: undetectable or very thin layers (<0.5 cm) of surface Mn enrichment occurred in the Bering-Chukchi shelves; thin layers (1-5 cm) of surface Mn enrichment occurred in Barrow Canyon and Lancaster Sound; and thick layers (5-20 cm) of surface Mn enrichment occurred in the Beaufort Shelf, Canadian Archipelago, and Davis Strait. Inventories of authigenic S below the Mn-rich layer decreased about fivefold from Bering-Chukchi shelf and Barrow Canyon to Lancaster Sound and more than ten-fold from Bering-Chukchi shelf to Beaufort Shelf, Canadian Archipelago and Davis Strait. The Mn, total S and reduced inorganic S distributions imply strong organic carbon (OC) flux and metabolism in the Bering-Chukchi shelves, lower aerobic OC metabolism in Barrow Canyon and Lancaster Sound, and deep O-2 penetration and much lower OC metabolism in the Beaufort Shelf, Canadian Archipelago, and Davis Strait. Accumulation rates of authigenic S, Mo, Cd, Re, and U displayed marked spatial variability along the NAAM reflecting the range in sedimentary redox conditions. Strong relationships between the accumulation rates and vertical carbon flux, estimated from regional primary production values and water depth at the coring sites, indicate that the primary driver in the regional patterns is the supply of labile carbon to the seabed. Thus, high primary production combined with a shallow water column (average 64 m) leads to high rates of authigenic trace element accumulation in sediments from the Bering-Chukchi shelves. High to moderate primary production combined with deep water (average 610 m) leads to moderate rates of authigenic trace element accumulation in sediments from Lancaster Sound. Low to very low primary production combined with moderate water depths (average 380 m) leads to low rates of authigenic trace element accumulation in sediments in the Beaufort Shelf, Davis Strait and Canadian Archipelago. Authigenic Mo accumulation rates show a significant relationship with vascular plant input to the sediments, implying that terrestrial organic matter contributes significantly to metabolism in Arctic margin sediments. Our results suggest that the broad and shallow shelf of the Chukchi Sea, which has high productivity sustained by imported nutrients, contributes disproportionately to global biogeochemical cycles.

This stratigraphic section was deposited in a coastal to shallow marine environment on the southern margin of the Tethys Ocean, an area that has not previously been the focus of rare earth element (REE) and redox-sensitive trace element studies. Geochemical data from this region may potentially inform ongoing discussions about redox conditions along the Tethys margin during the Permian-Triassic transition. To better understand redox conditions on the southern Tethyan margin, we analyzed a total of 33 samples from the PTB interval in the upper part of the Khuff Formation, for major and trace elements and REEs. The thorium-uranium ratio (Th/U), uranium (U) and vanadium (V) content, and cerium (Ce) anomaly all serve as potential redox indicators. Multivariate analysis (principal component analysis and linear regression) of the elemental composition of the samples suggests that these redox indicators are predominantly associated with the detrital fraction. Th/U ratios were generally >2, U and V concentrations do not show any significant authigenic enrichment, and Ce anomalies fluctuates around 1.0. Collectively, these results indicate that the distribution of redox indicators in this section is mainly controlled by the detrital composition, and that shallow marine waters at the time of deposition were oxic. Comparing our results with data from other Tethys sections reveals that redox conditions in shallow marine environments were heterogeneous in the aftermath of the Permian-Triassic extinction, and may reflect primarily local controls.

Marine inventories of redox-sensitive trace elements reflect the relative balance of oxidative weathering on land and deposition in anoxic water masses, and can be used to explore the evolution of oceanic and atmospheric redox conditions. For this study, we conducted a series of geochemical analyses on the upper Lantian, Piyuancun, and Hetang formations in the Chunye-1 well, part of the lower Yangtze Block in western Zhejiang. Iron speciation results indicate that the entire studied interval was deposited under anoxic conditions, with three intervals of persistent euxinia occurring in the uppermost Lantian Fm., the lower Hetang Formation (Fm.), and the upper Hetang Fm. Molybdenum (Mo) and uranium (U) contents and Mo/TOC and U/TOC ratios from the anoxic/euxinic intervals of the Chunye-1 well, combined with published data from the sections in the middle and upper Yangtze Block, suggest that the oceanic Mo reservoir declined consistently from the Ediacaran to Cambrian Stage 3, while the size of the oceanic U reservoir remained relatively constant. Both metals were depleted in the ocean in lower Cambrian Stage 4, before increasing markedly at the end of Stage 4. The lack of an apparent increase in the size of the marine Mo and U reservoir from the upper Ediacaran to Cambrian Stage 3 suggests that oxic water masses did not expand until Cambrian Stage 4. The increase in marine Mo and U availability in the upper Hetang Fm. may have been due to the expansion of oxic water masses in the oceans, associated with oxygenation of the atmosphere during Cambrian Stage 4. This expansion of oxic waters in the global ocean postdates the main phase of Cambrian diversification, suggesting that pervasive oxygenation of the ocean on a large scale was not the primary control on animal diversity following the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition.

The metal complexes displayed octahedral, tetrahedral and square-planar geometrical arrangements, while uranium complex displayed seven-coordinate. Kinetic parameters (Ea, A, Delta H, Delta S and Delta G) of the thermal decomposition stages have been evaluated using Coats -Redfern equations. The molecular structural parameters of the ligand and its metal complexes have been calculated and correlated with the experimental data such as IR. The antimicrobial activity of the ligand and its complexes was screened against some kinds of bacteria and fungi. The antitumor activity of the ligand and its Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes was investigated against HepG2 cell line. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The detection limit in deionized water reaches 0.9 mu g/L, far below the maximum contamination standard of 30 mu g/L in drinking water defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, making compound 1 currently the only MOF material that can achieve this goal. More importantly, this material exhibits great capability in detecting uranyl ions in natural water systems such as lake water and seawater with pH being adjusted to 4, where huge excesses of competing ions are present. The uranyl detection limits in Dushu Lake water and in seawater were calculated to be 14.0 and 3.5 mu g/L, respectively. This great detection capability originates from the selective binding of uranyl ions onto the Lewis basic sites of the MOF material, as demonstrated by synchrotion radiation extended X-ray adsorption fine structure, X-ray adsorption near edge structure, and first principles calculations, further leading to an effective energy transfer between the uranyl ions and the MOF skeleton.","Authors":"Liu, W (Liu, Wei) ; Dai, X (Dai, Xing) ; Bai, ZL (Bai, Zhuanling) ; Wang, YL (Wang, Yanlong) ; Yang, ZX (Yang, Zaixing) ; Zhang, LJ (Zhang, Linjuan) ; Xu, L (Xu, Lin) ; Chen, LH (Chen, Lanhua) ; Li, YX (Li, Yuxiang) ; Gui, DX (Gui, Daxiang) ; Juan, DW (Juan Diwu) ; Wang, JQ (Wang, Jianqiang) ; Zhou, RH (Zhou, Ruhong) ; Chai, ZF (Chai, Zhifang) ; Wang, SA (Wang, Shuao) ...More...Less","Title":"Highly Sensitive and Selective Uranium Detection in Natural Water Systems Using a Luminescent Mesoporous Metal-Organic Framework Equipped with Abundant Lewis Basic Sites: A Combined Batch, X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy, and First Principles Simulation Investigation"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398182000013 ISSN: 1434-1948 eISSN: 1099-0682","Categories":"Chemistry Web of Science Categories:Chemistry, Inorganic & Nuclear","Journal Information":"EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY Issue: 13 Pages: 1938-1946 DOI: 10.1002/ejic.201700024 Published: APR 3 2017","Abstract":"U-VI chemistry is dominated by the uranyl ( UO2) (2+) cation, in which the oxo group is essentially passivated by a triple bond to the metal center. Weak interactions between the oxo group Lewis acids or hydrogen- bond donors can be observed in extended solids, but there is little understanding of how the uranyl bond is affected by these additional forces. In the current study, the influence of charge- assisted hydrogen- bonding and crystallization effects on the uranyl oxo bond is explored through the synthesis and characterization of four uranyl compounds: [(UO2)(3)(Gly)(2)(O)(2)(OH)(2)](H2O)(1.5) ( UG1b), [( UO2)(4)( Gly)(3)( For)(O)(3)(OH)]( H2O)(6.5) (UGFA1a), [(UO2)(8)(Gly)(6)(For)(2)(O)(6)(OH)(2)](H2O)(10) ( UGFA1b), and [(UO2)(4)(Gly)(3)(O)(3)(OH)(2)](HFor)( H2O)(9.45) UGFA2). Each of these compounds contains uranyl infinite chain topologies that are built upon trimeric or tetrameric repeating units and are linked through multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions to the uranyl oxo groups. The impact on the uranyl bond was explored through an examination of hydrogen- bonding donor- acceptor distances and the calculation of force constants obtained from Raman and IR spectral bands. The stretching force constants are lower with cooperative hydrogen bonds to the uranyl oxo groups. This suggests that these interactions are important and can combine with crystallization effects to impact the uranyl oxo bond.","Authors":"de Groot, J (de Groot, Joshua) ; Cassell, B (Cassell, Brittany) ; Basile, M (Basile, Madeline) ; Fetrow, T (Fetrow, Taylor) ; Forbes, TZ (Forbes, Tori Z.)","Title":"Charge-Assisted Hydrogen-Bonding and Crystallization Effects within U-VI Glycine Compounds"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398429700088 ISSN: 2168-0485","Keywords":"Nanocomposites; Layered double hydroxides; Immobilization; U(VI); EXAFS KeyWords Plus:GRAPHENE OXIDE NANOSHEETS; GRAPHITIC CARBON NITRIDE; METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS; ZERO-VALENT IRON; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; ADSORPTIVE REMOVAL; SELECTIVE ADSORPTION; HYDROTHERMAL CARBON; MODELING TECHNIQUES; BACILLUS-SUBTILIS","Categories":"Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering Web of Science Categories:Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; GREEN & SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY; Engineering, Chemical","Journal Information":"ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING Volume: 5 Issue: 4 Pages: 3583-3595 DOI: 10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b00439 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Novel, efficient, glycerol-modified nanoscale layered double hydroxides (rods Ca/Al LDH-Gl and flocculent Ni/Al LDH-Gl) were successfully synthesized by a simple one-step hydrothermal synthesis route and showed excellent adsorption capacities for U(VI) from aqueous solutions under various environmental conditions. The advanced spectroscopy analysis confirmed the existence of abundant oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., C-O, O-C=O, and C=O) on the surfaces of Ca/AI LDH-Gl and Ni/Al LDH-Gl, which could provide enough free active sites for the binding of U(VI).

Macroscopic experiments proved that the interaction of U(VI) on Ca/Al LDH-Gl and Ni/Al LDH-Gl was due to surface complexation and electrostatic interactions. The extended Xray absorption fine structure analysis confirmed that U(IV) did not transformation to U(VI) on solid particles, and stable inner sphere complexes were not formed by reduction interaction but by chemical adsorption.

Of special interest are D-T neutron generators, which theoretically have shown the potential to be utilized as neutron sources for BNCT of deep-seated tumors. This work is devoted to investigate the feasibility of using the high-energy neutrons emitted from these generators for treatment of surface tumors, especially skin. Using a set of MCNPX simulations, the D-T neutrons are passed through an optimized arrangement of materials to slow-down toward the desired energy range, and to remove the neutron and gamma contamination considering the IAEA recommended criteria, especially determined for pre-clinical survey for treatment of surface tumors. By assessment with these parameters, it is shown that the designed beam, corresponding to a configuration composed of natural uranium as neutron multiplier, D2O as moderator, Pb as reflector, Bi as gamma filter, and polyethylene and BeO as collimators provides high-intensity of desired neutrons, and low-background doses as well. It was found that an appropriate material for collimator, if accompanied with an optimized geometry, is an important parameter for keeping the undesired components to the recommended level. A typical simulated phantom, subjected to the irradiation of the designed spectrum, is used to study the performance of the resultant beam in shallow tissue. For an arbitrary chosen B-10 concentration, the evaluated depth-dose curves show that the proposed configuration establishes acceptable agreement between the appropriate neutron intensity and penetration to desired depth in tissue in a reasonable treatment time of about 25-38 min. Considering the simulations carried out, the total dose delivered to the tumor is expected to be of about 4.2 times higher than that delivered to the first depths in healthy tissue, and of about 2.4 times higher than that delivered to the normal skin. These results in essence endorse the ability of D-T neutron generators to be used for BNCT of surface tumors, even with the yield of similar to 10(12) n/s.","Authors":"Masoudi, SF (Masoudi, S.

The skeleton is the main site of uranium long-term accumulation. While it has been shown that natural uranium is able to perturb bone metabolism through its chemical toxicity, its impact on bone resorption by osteoclasts has been poorly explored. Here, we examined for the first time in vitro effects of natural uranium on osteoclasts. Methods: The effects of uranium on the RAW 264.7 monocyte/macrophage mouse cell line and primary murine osteoclastic cells were characterized by biochemical, molecular and functional analyses. Results: We observed a cytotoxicity effect of uranium on osteoclast precursors. Uranium concentrations in the mu M range are able to inhibit osteoclast formation, mature osteoclast survival and mineral resorption but don't affect the expression of the osteoclast gene markers Nfatc1, Dc-stamp, Ctsk, Acp5, Atp6v0a3 or Atp6v0d2 in RAW 274.7 cells. Instead, we observed that uranium induces a dose-dependent accumulation of SQSTMl/p62 during osteoclastogenesis. Conclusions: We show here that uranium impairs osteoclast formation and function in vitro. The decrease in available precursor cells, as well as the reduced viability of mature osteoclasts appears to account for these effects of uranium. The SQSTMl/p62 level increase observed in response to uranium exposure is of particular interest since this protein is a known regulator of osteoclast formation.

It predicts simply that internal magnetization is allowed but localized magnetic moments are screened at distances of the order of the London penetration depth. A microscopic theory is considered for the case of ferromagnetic ordering, described in simple terms by electron-magnon coupling. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that itinerant electrons are not responsible for the magnetic ordering, but interact with phonon and magnon excitations, leading to an alternative Cooper pair channel. The temperature dependence and the isotope effect of the superconducting gap is also analysed.","Authors":"de Campos, FKR (Rodrigues de Campos, Fillipi Klos) ; Zanella, F (Zanella, Fernando) ; Dartora, C (Dartora, C.

Here, we present an in-depth study of metastable calcic amphibole megacrysts in basaltic andesites of Merapi volcano, Indonesia. Radiogenic Sr and Nd isotope compositions of the amphibole megacrysts overlap with the host rock range, indicating that they represent antecrysts to the host magmas rather than xenocrysts. Amphibolebased barometry suggests that the megacrysts crystallised at pressures of >500 MPa, i.e., in the mid-to lower crust beneath Merapi. Rare-earth element concentrations, in turn, require the absence of magmatic garnet in the Merapi feeding system and, therefore, place an uppermost limit for the pressure of amphibole crystallisation at ca. 800 MPa. The host magmas of the megacrysts seem to have fractionated significant amounts of amphibole and/or clinopyroxene, because of their low Dy/Yb ratios relative to the estimated compositions of the parent magmas to the megacrysts. The megacrysts' parent magmas at depth may thus have evolved by amphibole fractionation, in line with apparently coupled variations of trace element ratios in the megacrysts, such as e.g., decreasing Zr/Hf with Dy/Yb. Moreover, the Th/U ratios of the amphibole megacrysts decrease with increasing Dy/Yb and are lower than Th/U ratios in the basaltic andesite host rocks. Uranium in the megacrysts' parent magmas, therefore, may have occurred predominantly in the tetravalent state, suggesting that magmatic fO(2) in the Merapi plumbing system increased from below the FMQ buffer in the mid-to-lower crust to 0.6-2.2 log units above it in the near surface environment. In addition, some of the amphibole megacrysts experienced dehydrogenation (H-2 loss) and/or dehydration (H2O loss), as recorded by their variable H2O contents and D/H and Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios, and the release of these volatile species into the shallow plumbing system may facilitate Merapi's often erratic eruptive behaviour.","Authors":"Peters, STM (Peters, Stefan T.

When these plants were decommissioned and dismantled, the filters which mostly contained solid uranium fluoride and uranium oxyfluoride compounds and compressor ring dust, were broken into pieces, put into metal drums, and stored. This waste contains enriched uranium and can't be disposed of at the current disposal site (Vaalputs), which only accepts low and intermediate level waste. Initial attempts, directly after removal from the enrichment plants, to decontaminate these filters using various aqueous solutions, were unsuccessful probably because of the known non-wettability of PTFE surfaces. However, recent attempts to leach the absorbed enriched uranium were successful. This resulted in a study to determine the effect of mainly alpha-irradiation from the enriched uranium on the morphology of PTFE. A Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code (MCNP), a general purpose radiation transport code modelling the interaction of radiation with materials that simulate nuclear processes, was used to determine the rate of PTFE radiolysis. The results confirmed that the dose rate received from mainly the alpha-particles (97%) during the storage period had caused significant structural damage to the PTFE depending on the enrichment grade and the amount of uranium on the filters. To confirm the modelling data, analytical techniques, including micro X-ray tomography, thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray diffraction were used to study the morphology changes in the PTFE structure of the research samples. Experimental results indicated that the crystallinity increased while the molecular weight of the PTFE decreased. This could be attributed to the radiation induced degradation of the PTFE by the absorbed enriched uranium. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Authors":"Badenhorst, JJ (Badenhorst, J.

In particular, experimental observations indicate that substantial fission gas release (FGR) can occur on a small time scale during transients (burst release). To accurately reproduce the rapid kinetics of the burst release process in fuel performance calculations, a model that accounts for non-diffusional mechanisms such as fuel micro-cracking is needed. In this work, we present and assess a model for transient fission gas behaviOur in oxide fuel, which is applied as an extension of conventional diffusion-based models to introduce the burst release effect. The concept and governing equations of the model are presented, and the sensitivity of results to the newly introduced parameters is evaluated through an analytic sensitivity analysis. The model is assessed for application to integral fuel rod analysis by implementation in two structurally different fuel performance codes: BISON (multi-dimensional finite element code) and TRANSURANUS (1.5D code). Model assessment is based on the analysis of 19 light water reactor fuel rod irradiation experiments from the OECD/NEA IFPE (International Fuel Performance Experiments) database, all of which are simulated with both codes. The results point out an improvement in both the quantitative predictions of integral fuel rod FGR and the qualitative representation of the FGR kinetics with the transient model relative to the canonical, purely diffusion-based models of the codes. The overall quantitative improvement of the integral FGR predictions in the two codes is comparable. Moreover, calculated radial profiles of xenon concentration after irradiation are investigated and compared to experimental data, illustrating the underlying representation of the physical mechanisms of burst release.

The separation is based on the difference in solubility of the fission product metal oxides compared to the uranium oxide or molybdate in the molybdate melt. The molybdate melt dissolves uranium dioxide at high temperatures, and upon cooling, uranium precipitates as uranium dioxide or molybdate, whereas the fission product metals remain soluble in the melt. Small-scale experiments using gram quantities of uranium dioxide have been performed to investigate the feasibility of UO2 purification from the fission products. The composition of the uranium precipitate as well as data for partitioning of several fission product surrogates between the uranium precipitate and molybdate melt for various melt compositions are presented and discussed.

However, a zirconium (Zr) diffusion barrier must be used to eliminate interactions that form between the U-Mo monolith and aluminum alloy 6061 (AA6061) cladding during fabrication and are enhanced during irradiation. One aspect of fuel development and qualification is to demonstrate an appropriate understanding of the extent of fission product release from the fuel under anticipated service environments. An exothermic reaction has previously been observed between the AA6061 cladding and Zr diffusion layer. In this paper, two fuel segments with different irradiation history were subjected to specified thermal profiles under a controlled atmosphere using a thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyzer coupled with a mass spectrometer inside a hot cell. Samples from each segment were tested with cladding and without cladding to investigate the effect, if any, that the exothermic reaction has on fission gas release mechanisms. Measurements revealed there is an instantaneous effect of the cladding/Zr exothermic reaction, but not necessarily a cumulative effect above approximately 973 K (700 degrees C).

The recent finding of a U-specific stress response in Caulobacter crescentus has provided a foundation for studying the mechanisms of U-perception in bacteria. To gain insight into this process, we used a forward genetic screen to identify the regulatory components governing expression of the urcA promoter (PurcA) that is strongly induced by U. This approach unearthed a previously uncharacterized two-component system, named UzcRS, which is responsible for U-dependent activation of PurcA. UzcRS is also highly responsive to zinc and copper, revealing a broader specificity than previously thought. Using ChIP-seq, we found that UzcR binds extensively throughout the genome in a metal-dependent manner and recognizes a noncanonical DNA-binding site. Coupling the genome-wide occupancy data with RNA-seq analysis revealed that UzcR is a global regulator of transcription, predominately activating genes encoding proteins that are localized to the cell envelope; these include metallopeptidases, multidrug-resistant efflux (MDR) pumps, TonB-dependent receptors and many proteins of unknown function. Collectively, our data suggest that UzcRS couples the perception of U, Zn and Cu with a novel extracytoplasmic stress response.","Authors":"Park, DM (Park, Dan M.) ; Overton, KW (Overton, K.

These types of fuel based on mixing thorium as a fertile material with different fissile materials. The neutronic characteristics of these fuels are investigated by comparing their neutronic characteristics with the conventional uranium dioxide fuel using the MCNPX code. The objective of this study is to reduce the production of long-lived actinides, get rid of plutonium component and to improve the fuel cycle economy while maintaining acceptable values of the neutronic safety parameters such as moderator temperature coefficient, Doppler coefficient and effective delayed neutrons (beta). The thorium based fuel has a more negative Doppler coefficient than uranium dioxide fuel. The moderator temperature coefficient (MTC) has been calculated for the different proposed fuels. Also, the fissile inventory ratio has been calculated at different burnup step. The use of Th-232 as a fertile material instead of U-238 in a nuclear fuel is the most promising fuel in VVER-1200 as it is the ideal solution to avoid the production of more plutonium components and long-lived minor actinides. The reactor grade plutonium accumulated in light water reactor with burnup can be recycled by mixing it with Th-232 to fuel the VVER-1200 assembly. The concentrations of Xe-135 and Sm-151 have been investigated, due to their high thermal neutron absorption cross section. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Uranium mineralization is hosted in Neogene fluvial sediments that consist of predominantly sandstone and conglomerate inter layered with siltstone, claystone and mudstone. Sediments were primarily derived from metamorphic rocks adjacent to the basins of deposition, with some volcanic contribution in the form of tuffs. The sandstones and conglomerates are the most widespread sediments within the study area and host the majority of the U ore. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis were used to identify the ore and associated minerals. The uranium ore minerals of the host sedimentary rocks are torbernite, meta-torbernite and meta-autunite. These coexist with jarosite, various clays (chlorite/kaolinite, illite, and smectite), and Fe- and Mn-(hydr) oxides with minor titanium oxide. Additionally, quartz, feldspars and a minor amount of mica (muscovite and biotite) are the main primary minerals in the sedimentary rocks. The uranyl phosphates coat the surfaces of pebbles and some mineral grains, fill cracks, and are disseminated within the pores of the host sedimentary rocks. Uranyl phosphates are commonly associated with Fe-(hydr) oxides and clays, although some were observed in millimeter- or centimeter wide gaps within Koprubasi sediments. Oxides of manganese are also locally abundant and associated with uranyl phosphates. The uranyl phosphates in the sediments of the Koprubasi area most likely formed when oxidizing groundwater moved through the host rock. The common association of uranyl phosphates with Fe(hydr) oxides and clays suggests that the precipitation of uranyl phosphate minerals is mainly due to adsorption of the uranyl and phosphate to the surface of Fe-(hydr) oxides and clays.

Linear excess relative risks (ERR) and 95% CIs were estimated via Poisson regression for chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL) and non-CLL. Results The mean cumulative low-LET and high-LET RBM doses among the 86% radiation-exposed workers were 48 and 9 mGy, respectively. There was a positive non-significant dose-response for mortality from non-CLL (n= 120) in relation to low-LET (ERR/Gy=2.18; 95% CI-0.41 to 6.37) and high-LET radiation (ERR/Gy=16.65; 95% -1.13 to 46.75). A statistically significant excess was found for the subgroup chronic myeloid leukaemia (n= 31) in relation to low-LET radiation (ERR/Gy=7.20; 95% CI 0.48 to 24.54) and the subgroup myeloid leukaemia (n= 99) (ERR/Gy=26.02; 95% CI 2.55 to 68.99) for high-LET radiation. The ERR/Gy tended to be about five to ten times higher for high-LET versus low-LET radiation; however, the CIs largely overlapped. Results indicate no association of death from CLL (n= 70) with either type of radiation. Conclusions Our findings indicate an increased risk of death for specific subtypes from non-CLL in relation to chronic low-LET and high-LET radiation, but no such relation for CLL.","Authors":"Kreuzer, M (Kreuzer, Michaela) ; Sobotzki, C (Sobotzki, Christina) ; Fenske, N (Fenske, Nora) ; Marsh, JW (Marsh, James W.) ; Schnelzer, M (Schnelzer, Maria)","Title":"Leukaemia mortality and low-dose ionising radiation in the WISMUT uranium miner cohort (1946-2013)"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398579400035 ISSN: 0025-3162 eISSN: 1432-1793","Categories":"Marine & Freshwater Biology Web of Science Categories:Marine & Freshwater Biology","Journal Information":"MARINE BIOLOGY Volume: 164 Issue: 4 Article Number: 96 DOI: 10.1007/s00227-017-3099-8 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Studies on the growth response of corals to changing climate have largely focused on long-lived corals with relatively distinct density bands such as massive Porites corals. Little is known about the climatic response of other more abundant growth forms, such as branching Acropora corals, largely because of the absence of a clear annual density banding pattern. Using a combination of X-radiography, gamma densitometry, Sr/Ca analysis, and Uranium-Thorium (U-Th) dating, we quantified patterns of annual growth in the robust branching coral Isopora palifera from the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia (18 degrees 16' S 147 degrees 22' E) collected in May 2013. While visual analysis of the positive X-radiographs revealed alternating patterns of high-and low-density bands along the central growth axis, gamma-densitometry analysis suggests that these bands do not exhibit a clear annual cycle.

Comparisons between SST-Sr/Ca calibrations derived from our I. palifera samples with (i) massive Porites from the same location and (ii) Isopora spp. from the GBR and Papua New Guinea revealed significant differences of up to 3.5 degrees C, implying palaeoclimate reconstructions should use site-specific and species-specific Sr/Ca-SST calibrations.

Static steam autoclave tests were performed at 300 degrees C and 9 MPa for period of 0.5-1.5 hours. Microstructural analyses of UN pellets show that, in a high-pressure atmosphere, the fuel collapses principally by intergranular cracking generated by the precipitation of an oxide phase in the grain boundaries. This mechanism leads to a premature mechanical collapse of the fuel pellet, exposing fresh surfaces to steam, and ultimately accelerating the oxidation process. Increasing density (specifically eliminating open porosity) was found to delay the oxidation process, while increasing grain size was found to accelerate the degradation process due to a greater susceptibility to mechanical fracture by way of intergranular oxidation. The performance of the UN-10%U3Si2 composite proved to be better when compared to UN. The U3Si2 phase served to stabilize the UN grain boundary interface and reacted preferentially with the steam, thereby altering the failure mechanism. In this composite material, the cracking was predominantly intra-granular and the exposure of fresh surfaces was limited, resulting in a slower degradation process.","Authors":"Lopes, DA (Lopes, Denise Adorno) ; Uygur, S (Uygur, Selim) ; Johnson, K (Johnson, Kyle)","Title":"Degradation of UN and UN-U3Si2 pellets in steam environment"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397874400014 ISSN: 1342-937X eISSN: 1878-0571","Keywords":"Euxinic basins; Photic zone euxinia; Basin restriction; Element drawdown; Freshwater influx KeyWords Plus:LOWER RHINE BASIN; PHOTIC-ZONE ANOXIA; PALEOENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS; MARINE-SEDIMENTS; MODERN BLACK; RIVER WATER; EVENT 2; GERMANY; FRACTIONATION; INDICATORS","Categories":"Geology Web of Science Categories:Geosciences, Multidisciplinary","Journal Information":"GONDWANA RESEARCH Volume: 44 Pages: 205-218 DOI: 10.1016/j.gr.2016.10.017 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"The key drivers controlling the redox state of seawater and sediment pore waters in low energy environments can be inferred from redox-sensitive trace elements (RSTE), molecular biomarkers and trace metal isotopes. Here, we apply a combination of these tools to the Upper Permian Kupferschiefer (T1) from the Thuringian Basin, deposited in the southern part of the semi-enclosed Kupferschiefer Sea. Enrichment patterns of the RSTEs molybdenum (Mo) and uranium (U) as well as biomarker data attest to the rapid development of euxinic conditions in basin settings during early T1 times, which became progressively less extreme during T1 deposition. The evolution of redox conditions in basinal settings, and the associated delay in the onset of euxinia at more shallow marginal sites, can be attributed to the interaction of sea-level change with basin paleogeography. Euxinia in the southern Kupferschiefer Sea did not lead to near-quantitative depletion of aqueous Mo, possibly due to short deepwater renewal times in the Thuringian Basin, low aqueous H2S concentrations, the continuous resupply of RSTE during transgression and declining burial rates of RSTEs throughout T1 times. Drawdown of RSTE is, however, indicated for euxinic lagoon environments. Moreover, admixture of freshwater supplied to these lagoons by rivers strongly impacted local seawater chemistry. The highest Mo-isotope compositions of similar to 1.70 parts per thousand in basin sediments allow a minimum Kupferschiefer Sea seawater composition of similar to 2.40 parts per thousand to be estimated. This composition is similar to the similar to 2.30 parts per thousand estimate for the Late Permian open ocean, and confirms a strong hydrographic connection between the epeiric Kupferschiefer Sea and the global ocean. The substantial variation in Mo-isotope signatures is paralleled by diagnostic shifts in biomarkers responding to oxygenation in different parts of the water column. Water column chemistry has been affected by variation in sea level, hydrodynamic restriction, riverine freshwater influx and evaporitic conditions in shallow lagoons. Elucidation of the relative role of each driving factor by a single geochemical proxy is not feasible but the complex scenario can be disentangled by a multiproxy approach.

This study proposes the first metallogenic model for the Baxingtu deposit and provides new data on genetic processes involved in the uranium mineralisation of sandstone-type deposits that were characterised through petrographic observations, whole-rock geochemistry, and geochemical and/or mineralogical study of iron disulphide, uranium minerals, Fe-Ti oxides (EPMA, LA-ICP-MS), and organic matter (REP). The delta S-34 value has been measured in situ by SIMS on the different generations of iron disulphide. Within regional primary reduced sandstones, pre-ore uranium enrichment (U-mean = 7.6 ppm in whole rock) was identified on altered Fe-Ti oxides along with minor concentrations on organic matter (respectively 26.3% and 1.3% of the whole-rock U content), which together represent a significant source of uranium for the mineralisation. Additional pre-ore uranium concentrations may also be associated with clay minerals. Petrographic observations and REP data indicate that organic matter occurring in the host sandstone is mainly inherited from land plants and corresponds to type III or type IV kerogens. Ore stage iron disulphides largely occur as framboids and in replacement of organic matter or also as subidiomorphic to idiomorphic cement and crystal. Trace element signatures detected within framboids are likely indicative of formation mainly from a single event. Framboids and iron disulphide in replacement of organic matter have a light sulphur isotope signature characterised by delta S-34 values from -72.0 to -6.2 parts per thousand, suggesting that sulphur originated from bacterial sulphate reduction, which was mainly responsible for (1) the liberation of U from Fe-Ti oxides and organic matter, (2) the generation of ore-stage iron disulphides, (3) the bioreduction of uranium and (4) the production of a secondary H2S-rich reducing barrier also involved in uranium reduction. Uranyl and sulphate ions were transported through the host sandstone by low-temperature oxygenated groundwater and U(IV) was precipitated at the redox interface as nano to microcrystals of pitchblende and coffinite, dominantly associated with bacterial substrate and as intergrowth with biogenic iron disulphide or directly associated with organic matter and residual Ti-Fe oxides. The uranium mineralisation does not replace ore-stage iron disulphides.

Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of the goethite alpha-FeOOH (100) surface and the structure, water bond formation and dynamics of water molecules in the mineral/aqueous interface are presented. Several exchange correlation functionals were employed (PBE96, PBE96 + Grimme, and PBE0) in the simulations of a (3 x 2) goethite surface with 65 absorbed water molecules in a 3D-periodic supercell (a = 30 angstrom, FeOOH slab similar to 12 angstrom thick, solvation layer similar to 18 angstrom thick). Results: The lowest energy goethite (100) surface termination model was determined to have an exposed surface Fe3+ that was loosely capped by a water molecule and a shared hydroxide with a neighboring surface Fe3+. The water molecules capping surface Fe3+ ions were found to be loosely bound at all DFT levels with and without Grimme corrections, indicative that each surface Fe3+ was coordinated with only five neighbors. These long bonds were supported by bond valence theory calculations, which showed that the bond valence of the surface Fe3+ was saturated and surface has a neutral charge. The polarization of the water layer adjacent to the surface was found to be small and affected only the nearest water. Analysis by density difference plots and localized Boys orbitals identified three types of water molecules: those loosely bound to the surface Fe3+, those hydrogen bonded to the surface hydroxyl, and bulk water with tetrahedral coordination. Boys orbital analysis showed that the spin down lone pair orbital of the weakly absorbed water interact more strongly with the spin up Fe3+ ion. These weakly bound surface water molecules were found to rapidly exchange with the second water layer (similar to 0.025 exchanges/ps) using a dissociative mechanism. Conclusions: Water molecules adjacent to the surface were found to only weakly interact with the surface and as a result were readily able to exchange with the bulk water. To account for the large surface Fe-OH2 distances in the DFT calculations it was proposed that the surface Fe3+ atoms, which already have their bond valence fully satisfied with only five neighbors, are under-coordinated with respect to the bulk coordination.","Authors":"Chen, Y (Chen, Ying) ; Bylaska, EJ (Bylaska, Eric J.) ; Weare, JH (Weare, John H.)","Title":"Weakly bound water structure, bond valence saturation and water dynamics at the goethite (100) surface/aqueous interface: ab initio dynamical simulations"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398247800022 PubMed ID: 28304163 ISSN: 1089-5639","Categories":"Chemistry; Physics Web of Science Categories:Chemistry, Physical; Physics, Atomic, Molecular & Chemical","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A Volume: 121 Issue: 12 Pages: 2523-2530 DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpca.7b01344 Published: MAR 30 2017","Abstract":"Actinide trioxide (AnO(3), An = U, Np, Pu, Am, Cm) molecules have been investigated by relativistic multi reference quantum chemical calculations with the goal to elucidate their electronic structures.

Our previously introduced, new chromium-based EA-Cr/HTC-IRMS (Elemental Analyzer-Chromium/High-Temperature Conversion Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry) technique focused primarily on nitrogen-bearing compounds. Several technical and analytical issues concerning halogen-and sulfur-bearing samples, however, remained unresolved and required further refinement of the reactor systems. METHODS: The EA-Cr/HTC reactor was substantially modified for the conversion of halogen-and sulfur-bearing samples. The performance of the novel conversion setup for solid and liquid samples was monitored and optimized using a simultaneously operating dual-detection system of IRMS and ion trap MS. The method with several variants in the reactor, including the addition of manganese metal chips, was evaluated in three laboratories using EA-Cr/HTC-IRMS (on-line method) and compared with traditional uranium-reduction-based conversion combined with manual dual-inlet IRMS analysis (off-line method) in one laboratory. RESULTS: The modified EA-Cr/HTC reactor setup showed an overall H-2-recovery of more than 96% for all halogen-and sulfur-bearing organic compounds. All results were successfully normalized via two-point calibration with VSMOW-SLAP reference waters. Precise and accurate hydrogen isotopic analysis was achieved for a variety of organics containing F-, Cl-, Br-, I-, and S-bearing heteroelements. The robust nature of the on-line EA-Cr/HTC technique was demonstrated by a series of 196 consecutive measurements with a single reactor filling. CONCLUSIONS: The optimized EA-Cr/HTC reactor design can be implemented in existing analytical equipment using commercially available material and is universally applicable for both heteroelement-bearing and heteroelement-free organic-compound classes. The sensitivity and simplicity of the on-line EA-Cr/HTC-IRMS technique provide a much needed tool for routine hydrogen-isotope source tracing of organic contaminants in the environment.

However, the types of species and the structural details of the uranyl-mandelate complexes are still unknown. Understanding the nature of these complex species would provide better insight into the mechanism of their separation in liquid chromatography. METHODS: Formation of different species of the uranyl ion (UO2) with mandelic acid was studied using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with a quadrupole time-of-flight analyzer. The different species of uranyl nitrate with mandelic acid (MA) at ligand (L) to metal ratios in the range 1-10 were examined in both positive and negative ion modes. The stability of different species with the possible pathways of formation was scrutinized using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. RESULTS: In negative ion mode, nitrate-containing UO2(MA)(1), UO2(MA)(2) and UO2(MA)(3) species were found in good abundance. In positive ion mode, under-coordinated uranyl-mandelate species, and solvated (S) species of types UO2(MA)(1)(S), UO2(MA)(1)(S)(2) and UO2(MA)(2)(S), were observed whereas nitrate-containing species were absent. Interestingly, doubly and singly charged dimeric species were also identified in positive ion mode. The theoretically computed energetics of the various species are in close agreement with their experimentally observed intensities in ESI-MS. CONCLUSIONS: The most intense peak observed in ESI-MS, UO2(MA)(3), was found to be the energetically most favorable amongst different UO2(MA)(n) type species. Metal-ligand equilibria studied in the two modes yielded similar results.

Here, different types of apatite were synthesized using tributyl phosphate (TBP) and tested for the removal of uranium from various solutions using different reaction times and uranium concentrations. The uranium adsorption results showed that uranium adsorption reached a steady state within 24 h in tests open to atmosphere at a slightly alkaline pH in different background solutions. TBP-coated hydroxyapatite removed U better than hydroxyapatite alone did. The U removal mechanism was considered as multilayer adsorption, showing the best fit to the Freundlich isotherm. The maximal U adsorption capacity determined from the Langmuir isotherm is 38 mg of U g(-1). Because of the high U removal efficiency, even at the high pH used in this study, TBP-coated hydroxyapatite appears to be a promising adsorbent for the removal of U from various waste streams as well as for recovery of U from seawater.","Authors":"Kim, H (Kim, HyunJu) ; Um, W (Um, Wooyong) ; Kim, WS (Kim, Won-Seok) ; Chang, S (Chang, Seeun)","Title":"Synthesis of Tributyl Phosphate-Coated Hydroxyapatite for Selective Uranium Removal"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397834400002 ISSN: 0277-5387","Keywords":"Uranium; Halide; Azide; Triamidoamine; Sterically demanding KeyWords Plus:ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; MOLECULAR-STRUCTURE; OXIDE DERIVATIVES; CARBON-MONOXIDE; EARLY ACTINIDES; COMPLEXES; CHEMISTRY; BOND; SINGLE; METAL","Categories":"Chemistry; Crystallography Web of Science Categories:Chemistry, Inorganic & Nuclear; Crystallography","Journal Information":"POLYHEDRON Volume: 125 Pages: 2-8 Special Issue: SI DOI: 10.1016/j.poly.2016.07.001 Published: MAR 29 2017","Abstract":"Treatment of tri(2-aminoethyl)amine with three equivalents of (BuLi)-Li-n followed by the addition of three equivalents of Ph3SiCI afforded the triaminoamine Tren(TPs)H(3) [1, Tren(TPS)H(3) = N{CH2CH2N(H)SiPh3}(3)].

However, these concepts have not achieved the full modularization including power conversion system. This study suggests an innovative concept of a reactor cooled by supercritical state carbon dioxide (S-CO2). A reactor core with uranium carbide fuel controlled by drum type control rods was designed. The core has long life (20years) without refueling or reshuffling as well as inherent safety features. The reactor can be used as a distributed power source and replace outdated fossil fuel power plants for small cities. Moreover, the authors propose the S-CO2 Brayton cycle as a power conversion system to achieve compact and lightweight module. Because of compact core and power conversion system, the entire system can be contained in a single module. The target of the system is to be able to transport a single core and power conversion system module via ground transportation. In order to meet this target, single module's total weight is minimized in the order of 100 tons. The external size of a module is less than 7m in length and 4m in diameter. It produces 12MWe electricity from 36MWt reactor core. The S-CO2 Brayton cycle was optimized, and the cycle components such as turbomachineries and heat exchangers were designed preliminarily to observe the potential to maximize the performance while minimizing the weight. Moreover, a dry air-cooling option to reject waste heat for inland installation was selected for the suggested nuclear system. A concept of passive decay heat removal system was developed, and its performance was examined to determine the required heat removal capacity of the system to assure the system's safety under various anticipated accidents.

But compared with uranium, much less is known about the solvation and speciation of the vanadate ion in seawater. Herein, we utilize both first principles molecular dynamics and classical molecular dynamics simulations to provide a microscopic insight into the solvation of the HVO42- ion in pure water and in seawater. In pure water, we found that the dianion state is the most probable structure. But in a simulated seawater with 0.55 M NaC1, the NaHVO4 (-) over bar ion is most probable, followed by the neutral Na2HVO(4); averaging over 100-ns trajectory, the coordination number of Na+ ions around V was found to be 1.5 within a radius of 4.0 A. We found that the NaHVai4 (-) over bar ion can exist in two interchangeable states: a bidentate state where the Na+ ion interacts directly with two vanadate oxo groups; a monodentate where the Na+ ion interacts with only one vanadate oxo group. From this monodentate state, the Na+ ion can further dissociate away with a free -energy barrier of 2.5 kcal/mol. Our work therefore demonstrates that Na+ ions are closely associated with the vanadate species in seawater. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The response to this perturbation is localized due to distinct physico-biogeochemical environments and relatively long time scales for transport through the floodplain aquifer and vadose zone. Naturally reduced zones (NRZs) containing sediments higher in organic matter, iron sulfides, and non-crystalline U(IV) rapidly consume DO and nitrate to maintain anoxic conditions, yielding Fe(II) from FeS oxidative dissolution, nitrite from denittification, and U(VI) from nitrite-promoted U(IV) oxidation.

Depth-dependent activity of fermenters, aerobes, nitrate reducers, sulfate reducers, and chemolithoautotrophs (e.g., oxidizing Fe(II), S compounds, and ammonium) is linked to the presence of DO) which has higher concentrations near the water table.","Authors":"Yabusaki, SB (Yabusaki, Steven B.) ; Wilkins, MJ (Wilkins, Michael J.) ; Fang, YL (Fang, Yilin) ; Williams, KH (Williams, Kenneth H.) ; Arora, B (Arora, Bhavna) ; Bargar, J (Bargar, John) ; Beller, HR (Beller, Harry R.) ; Bouskill, NJ (Bouskill, Nicholas J.) ; Brodie, EL (Brodie, Eoin L.) ; Christensen, JN (Christensen, John N.) ; Conrad, ME (Conrad, Mark E.) ; Danczak, RE (Danczak, Robert E.) ; King, E (King, Eric) ; Soltanian, MR (Soltanian, Mohamad R.) ; Spycher, NF (Spycher, Nicolas F.) ; Steefel, CI (Steefel, Carl I.) ; Tokunaga, TK (Tokunaga, Tetsu K.) ; Versteeg, R (Versteeg, Roelof) ; Waichler, SR (Waichler, Scott R.) ; Wainwright, HM (Wainwright, Haruko M.) ...More...Less Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number Steefel, Carl  B-7758-2010  ","Title":"Water Table Dynamics and Biogeochemical Cycling in a Shallow, Variably-Saturated Floodplain"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397454400002 ISSN: 2491-9292","Categories":"Nuclear Science & Technology Web of Science Categories:Nuclear Science & Technology","Journal Information":"EPJ NUCLEAR SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES Volume: 3 Article Number: 2017006 DOI: 10.1051/epjn/2017006 Published: MAR 21 2017","Abstract":"SGaRD (Spectroscopy, Gamma rays, Rapid, Deterministic) code is used for the fast calculation of the gamma-ray spectrum, produced by a spherical shielded source and measured by a detector. The photon source lines originate from the radioactive decay of the unstable isotopes. The leakage spectrum is separated in two parts: the uncollided component is transported by ray tracing, and the scattered component is calculated using a multigroup discrete ordinates method. The pulse height spectrum is then simulated by folding the leakage spectrum with the detector response function, which is precalculated for each considered detector type. An application to the simulation of the gamma spectrum produced by a natural uranium ball coated with plexiglass and measured using a NaI detector is presented. The SGaRD code is also used to infer the dimensions of a one-dimensional model of a shielded gamma ray source. The method is based on the simulation of the uncollided leakage current of discrete gamma lines that are produced by nuclear decay. The material thicknesses are computed with SGaRD using a fast ray-tracing algorithm embedded in a nonlinear multidimensional iterative optimization procedure that minimizes the error metric between calculated and measured signatures.","Authors":"Humbert, P (Humbert, Philippe) ; Mechitoua, B (Mechitoua, Boukhmes)","Title":"Gamma ray transport simulations using SGaRD code"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397454400001 ISSN: 2491-9292","Categories":"Nuclear Science & Technology Web of Science Categories:Nuclear Science & Technology","Journal Information":"EPJ NUCLEAR SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES Volume: 3 Article Number: 2017001 DOI: 10.1051/epjn/2017001 Published: MAR 21 2017","Abstract":"Recently, increasing demands on the reduction of fuel cycle costs have led to higher burnup fuel designs. According to the erbia-credit super high burnup fuel concept, developed by mixing low content of erbia toUO(2) powder directly after reconversion process so that all fuel pins in a given fuel assembly are homogeneously doped, the present study aims to characterize, from a neutronic point of view, a 17 x 17 pressurized water reactor assembly enriched to 10.27 wt.% in U-235 with an erbia content of 1 at.% (i. e. 0.7 wt.%) by means of the deterministic neutronic code APOLLO2. For this purpose, a simplified thermal-hydraulic analysis was performed in order to evaluate the effects on fuel thermal conductivity of adding erbia to uranium oxide. The results obtained allow to conclude that an Er-doped assembly enriched to > 5 wt.% in U-235 represents an advantageous solution for very long fuel cycles, and it is so suited for very high burnups.","Authors":"Pergreffi, R (Pergreffi, Roberto) ; Mattioli, D (Mattioli, Davide) ; Rocchi, F (Rocchi, Federico)","Title":"Neutronics characterization of an erbia fully poisoned PWR assembly by means of the APOLLO2 code"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397313600028 PubMed ID: 28330357 ISSN: 0021-9606 eISSN: 1089-7690","Categories":"Chemistry; Physics Web of Science Categories:Chemistry, Physical; Physics, Atomic, Molecular & Chemical","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS Volume: 146 Issue: 11 Article Number: 114703 DOI: 10.1063/1.4978481 Published: MAR 21 2017","Abstract":"We describe a detailed theoretical analysis of how distortions from ideal cubic or O-h symmetry to tetrahedral, D-4h, symmetry affect the shape, in particular the width, of the U L-3-edge NEXAFS for U(VI) in octahedral coordination. The full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of the L-3-edge white line decreases with increasing distortion from O-h symmetry. In particular, the FWHM of the white line narrows whether the tetragonal distortion is to compression or to extension. The origin of this decrease in theFWHMis analyzed in terms of the electronic structure of the excited levels arising from the unoccupied U(6d). The relative importance of ligand field and of spin-orbit effects is examined, where the dominant role of ligand field effects is established. Especially at higher distortions, the ligand splittings decrease rapidly and lead to an accelerated, quadratic decrease in theFWHMwith increasing distortion. This is related to the increase of covalent character in the appropriate component of the Oh derived eg orbitals. Our ab initio theory uses relativistic wavefunctions for cluster models of the structures; empirical or semi-empirical parameters were not used to adjust prediction to experiment. A major advantage is that it provides a transparent approach for determining howthe character and extent of the covalent mixing of the relevant U and O orbitals affect the U L-3-edge white line.

The approach for purposeful control of a size of the incorporated particles has been developed based on Ostwald-Freundich equation. This equation has been adapted for precipitation in ion exchange materials. Both single nanoparticles (2-20 nm) and their aggregates were found in the polymer. Regulation of salt or acid concentration allows us to decrease size of the aggregates approximately in 10 times. Smaller particles are formed in the resin, which possess lower exchange capacity. Sorption of U(VI) cations from the solution containing also hydrochloride acid was studied. Exchange capacity of the composites is approximate to 2 times higher in comparison with the pristine resin. The organic-inorganic sorbents show higher sorption rate despite chemical interaction of sorbed ions with functional groups of the inorganic constituent: the models of reaction of pseudo-first or pseudo-second order can be applied. In general, decreasing in size of incorporated particles provides acceleration of ion exchange. The composites can be regenerated completely, this gives a possibility of their multiple use.","Authors":"Perlova, N (Perlova, Nataliya) ; Dzyazko, Y (Dzyazko, Yuliya) ; Perlova, O (Perlova, Olga) ; Palchik, A (Palchik, Alexey) ; Sazonova, V (Sazonova, Valentina)","Title":"Formation of Zirconium Hydrophosphate Nanoparticles and Their Effect on Sorption of Uranyl Cations"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:Chinese Accession Number: WOS:000398077600007 ISSN: 1000-3290","Keywords":"Np(NO3)(q)(n); density functional theory; binding energy; infrared spectral analysi KeyWords Plus:EFFECTIVE CORE POTENTIALS; PSEUDOPOTENTIALS; COMPLEXES; ENERGIES; DENSITY; SETS","Categories":"Physics Web of Science Categories:Physics, Multidisciplinary","Journal Information":"ACTA PHYSICA SINICA Volume: 66 Issue: 6 Article Number: 063101 DOI: 10.7498/aps.66.063101 Published: MAR 20 2017","Abstract":"In the process of nuclear waste disposal, the valuable uranium and plutonium are recycled and separated by dissolving the spent fuel in nitric acid. However, transuranic Np greatly influences the process of separation and recovery. Therefore, it is vital to study the structure and properties of nitrate, which is combined with neptunium ions and nitric acid. Furthermore, there are few researches about nitrate formed by tetravalent neptunium ions. So in this article, by using B3LYP hybrid method of density functional theory, the Gaussian 03 program is used to optimize the geometric construction of the coordination compounds Np(NO3)(q)(n) (n = 1-6, q = -2-+3) formed by the tetravalent neptunium ions (Np4+) and nitrate ion (NO3-). Under the relativistic effective core potential model, the structure parameters and properties are reported. It is found that NO3 coordinates to Np4+ as a bidentate ligand, and the Np-N and Np-O bonds are the shortest in Np(NO3)(2)(+2), while the binding energy of the Np(NO3)(4) is the largest. The infrared spectra of Np(NO3)(4) are calculated in the gas and liquid phase. Comparing with the available experimental data, the reliability of the calculation results in this work is confirmed.","Authors":"Ma, L (Ma Lei) ; Yin, YP (Yin Yao-Peng) ; Ding, XB (Ding Xiao-Bin) ; Dong, CZ (Dong Chen-Zhong)","Title":"Structures and properties of Np(NO3)(q)(n) (n=1-6, q =-2-+3) coordination compound"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397171100014 PubMed ID: 28316246 ISSN: 0020-1669 eISSN: 1520-510X","Categories":"Chemistry Web of Science Categories:Chemistry, Inorganic & Nuclear","Journal Information":"INORGANIC CHEMISTRY Volume: 56 Issue: 6 Pages: 3201-3206 DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02123 Published: MAR 20 2017","Abstract":"We present the synthesis, characterization, and one -electron oxidation of two uranium(IV) complexes, coordinated to the cyclen-anchored tetrakis(aryloxide) ligands tetrakishy hydroxybenzyl- 1, 4,7, 1 0 tetraazacyclododecane, ((ArOH)-Ar-R,R)(4)cyclen; R = Bu-t, Me.
