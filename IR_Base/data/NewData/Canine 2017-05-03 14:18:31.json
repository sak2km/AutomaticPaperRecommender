Canine prostate cancer (PCa) is an excellent preclinical model for human PCa. AR-42 is a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) developed at The Ohio State University that inhibits the proliferation of several cancers, including multiple myeloma, lung, and hepatocellular cancer. In this study, we investigated whether AR-42 would prevent or decrease. The growth and metastasis of a canine PCa (Ace-1 cells) to bone in vitro and in vivo. METHODS. Proliferation, cell viability, invasion, and metastasis of a canine prostate cancer cell line (Ace-1) were measured following treatment with AR-42. Expression of anoikis resistance, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and stem cell-related markers were also evaluated. To assess the efficacy of AR-42 on prevention of PCa metastasis to bone, Ace-1 cells were injected in the left cardiac ventricle of nude mice, mice were treated with AR-42, and the incidence and growth of bone metastasis were measured. Bioluminescence was performed to monitor the bone metastases in nude mice. RESULTS. AR-42 inhibited the in vitro proliferation of Ace-1 cells in a time-and dosedependent manner. The IC50 concentration of AR-42 for Ace-1 cells was 0.42mM after 24hr of treatment. AR-42 induced apoptosis, decreased cell migration, and increased the stem cell properties of Ace-1 cells in vitro. AR-42 downregulated E-cadherin, N-cadherin, TWIST, MYOF, anoikis resistance, and osteomimicry genes, while it upregulated SNAIL, PTEN, FAK, and ZEB1 gene expression in Ace-1 cells. Importantly, AR-42 decreased the bioluminescence and incidence of bone metastasis in nude mice. In addition, AR-42 induced apoptosis and altered the tumor cell morphology to an irregular cell phenotype with condensed chromatin in the bone metastases. CONCLUSION. AR-42 decreased PCa growth and bone metastasis, induced apoptosis, and downregulated osteomimicry genes in PCa cells in the bone microenvironment.

Cluster-based studies are often utilized to assess levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices of a population in response to education campaigns. The design of cluster-based studies requires estimates of intra-cluster correlation coefficients obtained from previous studies. This study estimates the school-level intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) for rabies knowledge change following an educational intervention program. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 226 students from 7 schools in Sikkim, India, using cluster sampling. In order to assess knowledge uptake, rabies education sessions with pre- and post session questionnaires were administered. Paired differences of proportions were estimated for questions answered correctly. A mixed effects logistic regression model was developed to estimate school-level and student-level ICC5 and to test for associations between gender, age, school location and educational level. Results: The school- and student-level ICC5 for rabies knowledge and awareness were 0.04 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.19) and 0.05 (95% CI: 0.2, 0.09), respectively. These ICCs suggest design effect multipliers of 5.45 schools and 1.05 students per school, will be required when estimating sample sizes and designing future cluster randomized trials. There was a good baseline level of rabies knowledge (mean pre-session score 71%), however, key knowledge gaps were identified in understanding appropriate behavior around scared dogs, potential sources of rabies and how to correctly order post rabies exposure precaution steps. After adjusting for the effect of gender, age, school location and education level, school and individual post session test scores improved by 19%, with similar performance amongst boys and girls attending schools in urban and rural regions. The proportion of participants that were able to correctly order post-exposure precautionary steps following educational intervention increased by 87%. Conclusion: The ICC estimates presented in this study will aid in designing cluster-based studies evaluating educational interventions as part of disease control programs. This study demonstrates the likely benefits of educational intervention incorporating bite prevention and rabies education. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This species has been proven to be an opportunistic agent in HIV+ patients and is also responsible of sporadic cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL).This work aims to evaluate the genetic variability of Moroccan L infantum strains based on PCR-RFLP analysis of the kinetoplastid DNA (kDNA) minicircles. A total of 75 DNA samples extracted from positive Giemsa-stained smears (n =32) and from L infantum cultures (n = 43) was studied. The samples have been taken from VL patients infected (n = 7) or not (n= 56) by HIV, patients with CL (n =2) and finally from infected dogs (n = 10). An hypervariable region of kDNA was amplified using the primers MC1 and MC2; the PCR products were digested separately by a panel of nine restriction enzymes. The presence or absence of restriction fragments was scored in a binary matrix and the SplitsTree4 software was used for the construction of a Neighbor-Net network. Moroccan L. infantum population showed an important level of variability with the identification of 6 genotypes. For each genotype a PCR product was sequenced, confirming the presence of all the expected restriction sites. The predominant profile was the genotype B. A new genotype, named Q was detected for the first time, whereas the four other genotypes (G, K, N and O) were reported sporadically in the Mediterranean basin. The Neighbor-Net network segregates our L infantum population into 3 clusters: Cluster I includes genotype B, cluster II grouping the genotypes O, Q and G and finally the cluster III contains the genotype N. The kDNA-PCR-RFLP assay is suitable for use directly on biological samples; it reveals an important degree of genetic variability among L infantum strains even those belonging to the same zymodeme what is of great epidemiological interest.

Early Childhood Caries (ECC) continues to be the most common public health issue in developing countries. Aim. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of ECC in 0- to 3-year-old children from rural areas of South India, using the ICDAS. Design. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 1486 children aged 0-3 years in South India. Two calibrated examiners performed the oral examinations using International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) criteria. Data analysis involved the use of the new ICDAS epidemiological software tool. Results. Prevalence of ECC in studied child population was 40.6%. Among the 604 children with ECC, only non-cavitated teeth were present in 314 children, and only cavitated teeth were present in 84 children. The remaining 206 children had both cavitated and non-cavitated teeth. Interesting lesion behavior was observed in 27 children, who had enamel lesions in mandibular canines only, in an otherwise sound dentition. On examining the teeth surfaces affected (n = 102,274), 50.3% had non-cavitated surfaces and 49.7% had cavitated surfaces. Conclusions. The results demonstrate the high prevalence of ECC in this population and the need to consider early diagnosis and specific preventive interventions.

Previous reports revealed that various flavonoids have anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, and cell differentiation-regulating activities with a number of physiological benefits, including protection from cardiovascular disease, cancers, and oxidative stress. As we found that the hydroxylation patterns of the flavonoid B ring are known to play a critical role in their function, we screened several flavonoids containing different numbers and positions of OH substitutions in B ring for their modulatory property on adipogenesis. In this study, we revealed the anti-adipogenic activity of the naturally derived flavonoid, 3,4-dihydroxyflavone (3,4-DHF) in murine 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and equine adipose-derived stromal cells (eADSCs). We found that treatment with 3,4-dihydroxyflavone (3,4-DHF) led to decreased expression of adipogenic markers and lipid deposition with differential modulation of ROS and kinase signaling pathways. Regulation of ROS generation through the differential modulation of ROS-regulating gene expression was revealed to have an important role in the suppression of adipogenesis and increase of osteogenesis in eADSCs following 3,4-DHF treatment. These results suggest that the flavonoid 3,4-DHF can be used to regulate adipogenesis in ADSCs, which has potential therapeutic application in regenerative medicine or health care for humans and many sport or companion animals.

The wild type and vaccine strains of canine distemper virus (CDV), influenza virus, canine herpesvirus (CHV), Bordetella bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma cynos were detected and differentiated simultaneously on a microarray chip. The detection limit is 10, 10, 100, 50 and 50 copy numbers for CDV, influenza virus, CHV, B. bronchiseptica and M. cynos, respectively.

Tumor stress often activates HSPs and the UPR as pro-survival mechanisms. This begs the question of stress effects on chemotherapeutic efficacy, particularly with drugs targeting chaperones such as HSP90 or GRP94. We tested the utility of several HSP90 inhibitors, including PU-H71 (targeting GRP94), on a primary canine lung cancer line under HS/UPR stress compared to control conditions.Methods: We cultured canine bronchoalveolar adenocarcinoma cells that showed high endogenous HSP90 and GRP94 expression; these levels substantially increased upon HS or UPR induction. We treated cells with HSP90 inhibitors 17-DMAG, 17-AAG or PU-H71 under standard conditions, HS or UPR. Cell viability/survival was assayed. Antibody arrays measured intracellular signalling and apoptosis profiles.Results: HS and UPR had varying effects on cells treated with different HSP90 inhibitors; in particular, HS and UPR promoted resistance to inhibitors in short-term assays, but combinations of UPR stress and PU-H571 showed potent cytotoxic activity in longer-term assays. Array data indicated altered signalling pathways, with apoptotic and pro-survival implications. UPR induction+dual targeting of HSP90 and GRP94 swayed the balance toward apoptosis.Conclusion: Cellular stresses, endemic to tumors, or interventionally inducible, can deflect or enhance chemo-efficacy, particularly with chaperone-targeting drugs. Stress is likely not held accountable when testing new pharmacologics or assessing currently-used drugs. A better understanding of stress impacts on drug activities should be critical in improving therapeutic targeting and in discerning mechanisms of drug resistance.","Authors":"Graner, AN (Graner, Arin N.) ; Hellwinkel, JE (Hellwinkel, Justin E.) ; Lencioni, AM (Lencioni, Alex M.) ; Madsen, HJ (Madsen, Helen J.) ; Harland, TA (Harland, Tessa A.) ; Marchando, P (Marchando, Paul) ; Nguyen, GJ (Nguyen, Ger J.) ; Wang, M (Wang, Mary) ; Russell, LM (Russell, Laura M.) ; Bemis, LT (Bemis, Lynne T.) ; Anchordoquy, TJ (Anchordoquy, Thomas J.) ; Graner, MW (Graner, Michael W.) ...More...Less","Title":"HSP90 inhibitors in the context of heat shock and the unfolded protein response: effects on a primary canine pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line*"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000394033400008 PubMed ID: 27653948 ISSN: 0213-3911 eISSN: 1699-5848","Keywords":"Ageing; Polyglucosan bodies; Prostate; Smooth muscle cells KeyWords Plus:LAFORA-LIKE BODIES; CORPORA-AMYLACEA; BODY DISEASE; EPILEPSY; INCLUSIONS; CANINE; TRACT","Categories":"Cell Biology; Pathology Web of Science Categories:Cell Biology; Pathology","Journal Information":"HISTOLOGY AND HISTOPATHOLOGY Volume: 32 Issue: 5 Pages: 499-502 DOI: 10.14670/HH-11-818 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"Polyglucosan bodies (PGB) in the prostate of aged dogs without neurological signs were examined by light microscopy, histochemistry and immunohistochemistry.

Ultrasonography gives a reliable estimate of the prostatic size, but a method for screening the prostate size using a serum sample has advantages, such as requiring less expensive equipment The primary aim of the study was to study the association between the concentration of the circulating biomarker canine prostate specific esterase (CPSE) and prostatic size. Seventy-nine dogs that were four years old or older were included in the study. Ultrasonography was used for calculating the volume of the prostate. The calculated volume was divided by an estimate of the normal prostatic volume in dogs aged one to four years, to determine the relative prostatic size: the size of the prostate in relation to the normal size in dogs 1-4 years old (S-rel). CPSE was analyzed from serum samples. Multiple linear regression analysis was used for studying associations between variables. Prediction intervals for the relative prostatic size based on CPSE concentrations were calculated, as were receiver operating curves for CPSE concentrations predicting S-rel. The concentration of CPSE was associated with the relative size and contour of the prostate (P < 0.001). All dogs with clinical signs of BPH had an S-rel >= 2.5. A CPSE concentration of 200 ng/mL predicted S-rel to 2.5 (95% P.I: 1.2-4.8). Based on ROC analysis, the optimal discrimination threshold for CPSE concentration for S-rel > 2.5 was estimated as 90 ng/mL (95% confidence interval: 50-140), with a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 72%. Screening for CPSE is of potential value in the aging intact male dogs. Although many dogs with an S-rel > 2.5 show no clinical signs, the insidious nature of BPH supports further investigations of the prostate in these dogs, corresponding to a CPSE concentration of approximately 90 ng/mL or higher.

Dog ovaries were obtained from 1-6y bitches at proestrus/estrus, anestrus and diestrus stages following ovariohysterectomy. Follicular cells were mechanically recovered from follicles distributed into four types (preantral, small antral, medium antral and large antral). Total RNA extraction was performed and the evaluation of gene expression levels was achieved by relative quantification q-PCR analysis. Intrafollicular amounts of LHR were assessed by western blot method. All results were evaluated by ANOVA. The expression levels of mRNA LHR in follicular cells were observed in every stage of development, however this gene expression varied over the estrous cycle. LHR transcripts increased (P < 0.05) from preantral to antral stage. There were not differences in LHR gene expression among follicles at preantral stages; however, at antral stages the lowest (P < 0.05) LHR mRNA expression was found at anestrus and the highest (P < 0.05) at proestrus/estrus. The LHR protein was also detected in dog follicles in all reproductive phases with patterns varying with stage of follicular development over the reproductive cycle. The antibody against human LHR revealed two bands at similar to 90 and similar to 67 kDa, probably representing the matured protein and its precursor respectively. Both bands LHR appeared already at preantral follicles increasing (P < 0.05) with growth. A high proportion of LHR was presented as immature forms in all follicles stages during different phases of the estrous cycle. In conclusion, the gene and protein of LHR are differentially expressed in dog follicles over the estrous cycle, increasing with growth and the precursor protein is the most predominant LHR form present in canine follicles.

The extrusion process can be triggered by apoptotic signalling(1), oncogenic transformation(2,3) and overcrowding of cells(4-6). Despite the important linkage of cell extrusion to developmental(7), homeostatic(5) and pathological processes(2,8) such as cancer metastasis, its underlying mechanism and connections to the intrinsic mechanics of the epithelium are largely unexplored. We approach this problem by modelling the epithelium as an active nematic liquid crystal (that has a long range directional order), and comparing numerical simulations to strain rate and stress measurements within monolayers of MDCK (Madin Darby canine kidney) cells. Here we show that apoptotic cell extrusion is provoked by singularities in cell alignments(9,10) in the form of comet-shaped topological defects. We find a universal correlation between extrusion sites and positions of nematic defects in the cell orientation field in different epithelium types. The results confirm the active nematic nature of epithelia, and demonstrate that defect-induced isotropic stresses are the primary precursors of mechanotransductive responses in cells, including YAP (Yes-associated protein) transcription factor activity(11), caspase-3-mediated cell death, and extrusions. Importantly, the defectdriven extrusion mechanism depends on intercellular junctions, because the weakening of cell-cell interactions in an a-catenin knockdown monolayer reduces the defect size and increases both the number of defects and extrusion rates, as is also predicted by our model. We further demonstrate the ability to control extrusion hotspots by geometrically inducing defects through microcontact printing of patterned monolayers. On the basis of these results, we propose a mechanism for apoptotic cell extrusion: spontaneously formed topological defects in epithelia govern cell fate. This will be important in predicting extrusion hotspots and dynamics in vivo, with potential applications to tissue regeneration and the suppression of metastasis. Moreover, we anticipate that the analogy between the epithelium and active nematic liquid crystals will trigger further investigations of the link between cellular processes and the material properties of epithelia.","Authors":"Saw, TB (Saw, Thuan Beng) ; Doostmohammadi, A (Doostmohammadi, Amin) ; Nier, V (Nier, Vincent) ; Kocgozlu, L (Kocgozlu, Leyla) ; Thampi, S (Thampi, Sumesh) ; Toyama, Y (Toyama, Yusuke) ; Marcq, P (Marcq, Philippe) ; Lim, CT (Lim, Chwee Teck) ; Yeomans, JM (Yeomans, Julia M.) ; Ladoux, B (Ladoux, Benoit)","Title":"Topological defects in epithelia govern cell death and extrusion"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398604700001 PubMed ID: 28388948 ISSN: 1746-6148","Keywords":"Canine; Epilepsy; Anxiolytic; Anxiety; Fear; Behaviour; Seizure; Idiopathic KeyWords Plus:QUALITY-OF-LIFE; BEHAVIOR; COMORBIDITIES; QUESTIONNAIRE; PREVALENCE; DEPRESSION; EFFICACY; SAFETY; TOLERABILITY; PHARMACOLOGY","Categories":"Veterinary Sciences Web of Science Categories:Veterinary Sciences","Journal Information":"BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH Volume: 13 Article Number: 90 DOI: 10.1186/s12917-017-1000-0 Published: APR 7 2017","Abstract":"Background: Behavioural changes associated with idiopathic epilepsy (IE) have been identified in dogs, with fear and anxiety-related problems seen in both drug-naive dogs and dogs treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Treating anxiety-related behaviour in dogs with IE may be challenging, as seizures are a contraindication for many conventional anxiolytic drugs. In addition, many dogs with IE are already treated with AEDs to reduce their seizure frequency, which may have negative effects if used in polytherapy. Imepitoin is low-affinity partial agonist at the benzodiazepine (BDZ) site of the GABAA receptor, and has been demonstrated to have both anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects in laboratory rodents. Imepitoin has been developed for the treatment of IE in dogs, with demonstrated anticonvulsant effects and high tolerability and safety. To date, imepitoin's potential to reduce anxiety in dogs with IE has not been investigated. An online survey was conducted to investigate the effect of imepitoin on fear and anxiety-related behaviours in dogs with IE. Eighty-five valid responses were received from owners of dogs with IE currently treated with imepitoin. Anxiety-related behaviour was quantified before and during imepitoin treatment using a validated questionnaire tool (C-BARQ). Results: No differences were observed in the five fear/anxiety-related measures between the two time periods (before vs. during treatment) for dog directed fear, stranger directed fear, non-social fear, pain sensitivity and separation related behaviour. A median 45% reduction in seizure frequency/month was observed following imepitoin treatment; however, imepitoin did not appear effective in reducing seizure frequency in a minority of cases. Polyphagia was the most common chronic side effect, and more side effects were reported in polytherapy cases. Conclusions: Imepitoin does not appear to improve anxiety-related behaviour in dogs with IE treated with this medication for its anti-epileptic effects. Investigating the effects of imepitoin upon the behaviour of dogs with recognised behavioural anxiety-related problems (e.g. specific fears and phobias, separation related behaviours), in both healthy dogs and dogs with epilepsy is required to further explore any potential anxiolytic effects of this medication.","Authors":"Packer, RMA (Packer, Rowena M.

Here we use an expanding island of confluent Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells as a model system to quantify the collective cell migration. In the absence of HGF, cell trajectories are highly tortuous whereas in the presence of HGF, they become far less so, resembling free expansion of a gas. At the level of cell-to-cell junctions, HGF attenuates the linkage of stress fibers to cell-to-cell junctions with concomitant decrease in intercellular stress. At the level of cell-to-substrate junctions, HGF augments the linkage of stress fibers to cell-to-substrate junctions with no apparent effect on traction. Together, HGF induces both structural changes in the actin-bound junctional protein complex and physical forces spanning multicellular clusters, which further promotes the expansion of confluent cellular layer.","Authors":"Jang, H (Jang, Hwanseok) ; Notbohm, J (Notbohm, Jacob) ; Gweon, B (Gweon, Bomi) ; Cho, YB (Cho, Youngbin) ; Park, CY (Park, Chan Young) ; Kee, SH (Kee, Sun-Ho) ; Fredberg, JJ (Fredberg, Jeffrey J.) ; Shin, JH (Shin, Jennifer H.) ; Park, Y (Park, Yongdoo)","Title":"Homogenizing cellular tension by hepatocyte growth factor in expanding epithelial monolayer"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398135000008 PubMed ID: 28373696 ISSN: 2045-2322","Categories":"Science & Technology - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:Multidisciplinary Sciences","Journal Information":"SCIENTIFIC REPORTS Volume: 7 Article Number: 534 DOI: 10.1038/s41598-017-00642-6 Published: APR 3 2017","Abstract":"Left stellate ganglion (LSG) hyperactivity promotes ischemia induced ventricular arrhythmia (VA).

VA was assessed for 60 min after ischemia and then LSG tissues were collected for molecular biological experiments. Compared with DMSO, concentration-dependent prolonged action potential duration and effective refractory period, decreased LSG function were identified after A-803467 treatment. Moreover, the severity of ischemia induced VA was decreased in A-803467 groups.

Despite orofacial clefting and oligodontia being central features of the condition, detailed reports of dental and craniofacial characteristics are scarce. The aim of this study was to analyze the dental and craniofacial features in a group of patients with BCD syndrome (three of which were related). Cephalometric radiographic analyses were performed on BCD syndrome patients (all radiographs taken at age 8 years) and compared to 40 randomly selected age-matched controls (20 non-syndromic BCLP, 20 non-cleft). Also, we assessed clinical records, photographs, dental study casts, and dental radiographs to determine the extent and pattern of tooth agenesis, dental morphology and malocclusion. BCD syndrome patients showed a very severe skeletal III malocclusion (maxillary-mandibular sagittal discrepancy) and reduced anterior lower face measurement compared to non-syndromic BCLP and non-cleft controls (P = 0.001, P = 0.027). All patients exhibited oligodontia (mean number of missing permanent teeth 13.7, range 7-17). All patients exhibited missing upper central and lateral incisor, upper canine and premolar teeth. Variations in dental morphology included taurodontism, conical-shaped teeth, and notching of the incisal edges. All patients had a short and narrow maxilla which translated into anterior and posterior cross bites. We conclude that, in our BCD syndrome group, the craniofacial skeletal defects are more severe than patients with BCLP. The pattern of tooth agenesis is unusual as it included teeth that are normally highly resistant to agenesis, namely upper central incisor and canine teeth.

As its appearance was similar to toothpick grooves described in other Homo species, it could correspond to early stages on its formation. To test this hypothesis we developed an experimental replication of a groove using grass stalks. Materials and Methods: Comparisons between 204 isolated Neandertal teeth and the two experimental dental specimens corroborate that the marks correspond to initial stages of toothpick groove formation, and we propose a five-grade recording scale that summarized the groove formation process. Results: Using this new recording procedure, we found that Hortus individuals have higher incidence of this trait (eight individuals out of nine) than the El Sidron individuals (nine out of 11). Toothpick grooves from El Sidron show the earliest stages of development, whereas the grooves found on Hortus Neandertals were well-developed. Toothpick grooves were also found in 21 incisors and canines. Conclusions: These differences could be due to the more advanced occlusal dental wear in Hortus individuals, maybe age-related and with a more meat-based diet maybe favoring the inclusion of food debris and thus probing as the cleaning methodology. Our results allow the identification and characterization of incipient toothpick grooves on the human fossil record and contribute to increase our knowledge on Neandertals behavioral and oral care habits.","Authors":"Estalrrich, A (Estalrrich, Almudena) ; Alarco, JA (Antonio Alarcon, Jose) ; Rosas, A (Rosas, Antonio)","Title":"Evidence of toothpick groove formation in Neandertal anterior and posterior teeth"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397872800002 PubMed ID: 28122720 ISSN: 0363-6119 eISSN: 1522-1490","Keywords":"VO2 kinetics; O-2 extraction; near-infrared spectroscopy; flow-mediated dilation; short-term exercise training KeyWords Plus:FLOW-MEDIATED DILATION; MODERATE-INTENSITY EXERCISE; MUSCLE DEOXYGENATION KINETICS; O-2 UPTAKE KINETICS; SITU CANINE MUSCLE; UPTAKE ON-KINETICS; DOTO(2) KINETICS; GAS-EXCHANGE; TIME-COURSE; OXIDATIVE-PHOSPHORYLATION","Categories":"Physiology Web of Science Categories:Physiology","Journal Information":"AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-REGULATORY INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY Volume: 312 Issue: 4 Pages: R467-R476 DOI: 10.1152/ajpregu.00399.2016 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine the time course of changes in the oxygen uptake (VO2) kinetics response subsequent to short-term exercise training (i. e., 24, 48, 72, and 120 h posttraining) and examine the relationship with the time course of changes in microvascular [deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration ([HHb])-to-VO2 ratio ([HHb])/VO2)] and macrovascular [flow-mediated dilation (FMD)] O-2 delivery to the active tissues/limbs.

However, carnivore intraguild interactions are hard to quantify. In this study, we asked 512 villagers residing around a conservation area in the Serengeti Ecosystem, Tanzania, to report on the presence of wild carnivores in their village, the number of domestic dogs Canis familiaris and cats Felis catus in their household and interactions between domestic and wild carnivores. Wild carnivores are abundant near households surrounding the Serengeti National Park, villagers have many free-ranging domestic dogs (and would like to have more) and direct and indirect contacts between wild and domestic carnivores are common. Large carnivores, such as spotted hyenas and leopards, often killed or wounded domestic dogs. Small carnivores, such as mongoose, bat-eared fox, serval and wildcat, are locally abundant and frequently interact with domestic dogs. We demonstrate that interspecific carnivore behavior, human culture and local and regional geography play a complex role in domestic and wild carnivore interaction risk around conservation areas. Through the use of household surveys, we were able to efficiently obtain data on a wide scope of carnivore interactions over a large area, which may provide a direction for future targeted and in-depth research to reduce interspecific conflict. Improving the health and husbandry of domestic animals and reducing the unintentional feeding of wild carnivores could reduce dog-wildlife interactions and the potential for pathogen transmission at the domestic-wild animal interface.","Authors":"Craft, ME (Craft, M.

Prophylactics and therapies are urgently needed to address this public health problem. We report here the efficacy of a vaccine consisting of chimeric virus-like particles (VLP) expressing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV. In this study, a fusion of the canine parvovirus (CPV) VP2 structural protein gene with the RBD of MERS-CoV can self-assemble into chimeric, spherical VLP (sVLP) sVLP retained certain parvovirus characteristics, such as the ability to agglutinate pig erythrocytes, and structural morphology similar to CPV virions. Immunization with sVLP induced RBD-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. sVLP-specific antisera from these animals were able to prevent pseudotyped MERS-CoV entry into susceptible cells, with neutralizing antibody titers reaching 1: 320. IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-2 secreting cells induced by the RBD were detected in the splenocytes of vaccinated mice by ELISpot. Furthermore, mice inoculated with sVLP or an adjuvanted sVLP vaccine elicited T-helper 1 (Thl) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cell-mediated immunity. Our study demonstrates that sVLP displaying the RBD of MERS-CoV are promising prophylactic candidates against MERS-CoV in a potential outbreak situation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In vertebrate epithelia and endothelia, tight and adherens junctions (AJ) play critical roles in barrier and adhesion functions, and are connected to the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. The interaction between junctions and the cytoskeleton is crucial for tissue development and physiology, and is involved in the molecular mechanisms governing cell shape, motility, growth and signalling. The machineries which functionally connect tight and AJ to the cytoskeleton comprise proteins which either bind directly to cytoskeletal filaments, or function as adaptors for regulators of the assembly and function of the cytoskeleton. In the last two decades, specific cytoskeleton-associated junctional molecules have been implicated in mechanotransduction, revealing the existence of multimolecular complexes that can sense mechanical cues and translate them into adaptation to tensile forces and biochemical signals. Here, we summarise the current knowledge about the machineries that link tight and AJ to actin filaments and microtubules, and the molecular basis for mechanotransduction at epithelial and endothelial AJ.","Authors":"Sluysmans, S (Sluysmans, Sophie) ; Vasileva, E (Vasileva, Ekaterina) ; Spadaro, D (Spadaro, Domenica) ; Shah, J (Shah, Jimit) ; Rouaud, F (Rouaud, Florian) ; Citi, S (Citi, Sandra)","Title":"The role of apical cell-cell junctions and associated cytoskeleton in mechanotransduction"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398652100011 PubMed ID: 28082076 ISSN: 8756-3282 eISSN: 1873-2763","Keywords":"Implant fixation; Allograft; Bisphosphonate; Bone morphogenetic protein; Joint replacement KeyWords Plus:ALLOGRAFT BONE; FOLLOW-UP; OP-1; ZOLEDRONATE; INCREASES; MODEL; PROSTHESES; SECTIONS; CHAMBER; DENSITY","Categories":"Endocrinology & Metabolism Web of Science Categories:Endocrinology & Metabolism","Journal Information":"BONE Volume: 97 Pages: 76-82 DOI: 10.1016/j.bone.2017.01.007 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Bone allograft is used in total joint arthroplasties in order to enhance implant fixation. BMPs are known to stimulate new bone formation within allograft, but also known to accelerate graft resorption. Bisphosphonates are strong inhibitor of bone resorption. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the bisphosphonate zoledronate was able to counteract the accelerated graft resorption without interfering with the BMP induced bone formation. In the present study the two drugs alone and in combination were studied in our canine model of impaction bone grafting. We included 10 dogs in this study. Cancellous allograft bone grafts were soaked in either saline or zoledronate solution (0.005 mg/mL) and then vehicle or BMP2 (0.15 mg rhBMP2) was added. This produced four treatment groups: A) control, B) BMP2, C) zoledronate and D) BMP2 + zoledronate. The allograft treated with A, B, C or D was impacted into a circumferential defect of 2.5 mm around HA-coated porous Ti implants. Each dog received all four treatment groups with two implants in the distal part of each femur. The group with allograft soaked in zoledronate (C) showed better biomechanical fixation than all other groups (p < 0.05). It had less allograft resorption compared to all other groups (p < 0.005) without any statistically significant change in new bone formation. The addition of BMP2 to the allograft did not increase new bone formation significantly, but did accelerate allograft resorption. This was also the case where the allograft was treated with BMP2 and zoledronate in combination (D). This caused a decrease in mechanical implant fixation in both these groups compared to the control group, however only statistically significant for the BMP2 group compared to control. The study shows that topical zoledronate can be a valuable tool for augmenting bone grafts when administered optimally. The use of BMP2 in bone grafting procedures seems associated with a high risk of bone resorption and mechanical weakening. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Two chitosan-based radiopaque hydrogels were prepared, one with STS and one without STS. Their rheological, injectability, and embolizing properties were assessed in vitro; afterwards, their efficacy in occluding endoleaks was compared in a canine bilateral aneurysm model reproducing type I endoleaks (n = 9 each). The primary endpoint was endoleak persistence at 3 or 6 months, assessed on a CT scan and macroscopic examination. Secondary endpoints were the occurrence of stent-graft (SG) thrombosis, the evolution of the aneurysm mean diameter, as well as aneurysm healing and inflammation scores in pathology examinations. In vitro experiments showed that both products gelled rapidly and presented initial storage moduli greater than 800 Pa, which increased with time. Both gels were compatible with microcatheter injection and occlude flow up to physiological pressure in vitro. In a type I endoleak model, the injection of CH-STS sclerosing gel tended to reduce the risk of occurrence of endoleaks, compared to CH non-sclerosing agent (2/9 vs. 6/9, p = 0.069). No case of SG thrombosis was observed. Moderate inflammation was found around both gels, with a comparable intensity score in both CH and CH-STS groups (2.6 +/- 0.9 and 2.7 +/- 0.9, respectively; p = 0.789). Flow occlusion combined with chemical endothelial denudation appears promising for the treatment of endoleaks.

Materials In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study, OA was induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) according to the Pond-Nuki model in 32 canines. All canines were allocated into 4 treatment subgroups with treatment administered for 8 weeks: GS (400 mg) intra-articular, placebo intra-articular, GS (200 mg/kg body weight) oral, and placebo oral. The contralateral nonoperated stifle (knee) served as control. After 8 weeks, the medial and lateral femoral condyles, the medial and lateral tibial plateau and patella were histologically examined and anatomic changes quantified by light microscopy using the modified Mankin score. Results After 8 weeks, mean Mankin score values significantly (P < 0.002) decreased in the intra-articular GS group (8.1; range 7.9-8.8) compared with the intra-articular placebo group (13.9; range 11.6-15.9) and again significantly (P < 0.002) in the oral GS group (12.1; range 9.9-12.7) compared with the oral placebo group (15.1; range 12.5-17.0).

The major ion channels were constructed based on published data recorded from isolated human colonic myocytes.

Material and Methods Forty morse-taper abutment/implant sets of titanium were divided into four groups (N=10): G4.8S-4.8 abutment with screw-retained crown; G4.8C-4.8 abutment with cemented crown; G3.8S-3.8 abutment with screw-retained crown; and G3.8C-3.8 abutment with cemented crown. Copings were waxed on castable cylinders and cast by oxygen gas flame and injected by centrifugation. After, esthetic veneering ceramic was pressed on these copings for obtaining metalloceramic crowns of upper canine. Cemented crowns were cemented on abutments with provisional cement (Temp Bond NE), and screw-retained crowns were tightened to their abutments with torque recommended by manufacturer (10Ncm). The misfit was measured using a stereomicroscope in a 10x magnification before and after cyclic loading (300,000 cycles). Tests were visually monitored, and failures (decementation, screw loosening and fractures) were registered. Misfit was analyzed by mixed linear model while failure modes by chi-square test (=0.05). Results Cyclic loading affected misfit of 3.8C (P0.0001), 3.8S (P=0.0055) and 4.8C (P=0.0318), but not of 4.8S (P=0.1243). No differences were noted between 3.8S with 4.8S before (P=0.1550) and after (P=0.9861) cyclic loading, but 3.8C was different from 4.8C only after (P=0.0015) loading. Comparing different types of retentions at the same diameter abutment, significant difference was noted before and after cyclic loading for 3.8 and 4.8 abutments. Analyzing failure modes, retrievable failures were present at 3.8S and 3.8C groups, while irretrievable were only present at 3.8S. Conclusions The cyclic loading decreased misfit of cemented and screw-retained crowns on reduced diameter abutments, and misfit of cemented crowns is greater than screw-retained ones.

Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were exposed to 2 mM oxalate for 48 h to evaluate the protective effect of T. arjuna aqueous extract on cell viability, CaOx crystal adherence and apoptotic changes caused by oxalate. The results confirmed that oxalate injured MDCK cells were protected by T. arjuna extract. On treatment with a range concentrations, the cell viability increased in a concentration dependent manner. Moreover, the extract prevented the interaction of the calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals with the cell surface and reduced the number of apoptotic cells. The current data suggests that T. arjuna bark confers a cytoprotective role and based on our results it could be a potential candidate from natural plant sources against urolithiasis.","Authors":"Mittal, A (Mittal, Amisha) ; Tandon, S (Tandon, Simran) ; Singla, SK (Singla, Surender Kumar) ; Tandon, C (Tandon, Chanderdeep)","Title":"Cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic role of Terminalia arjuna on oxalate injured renal epithelial cells"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397479600007 PubMed ID: 27940099 ISSN: 0739-7240 eISSN: 1879-0054","Keywords":"Steroid; Cortisol; HPA axis; Stress; Canine; Keratin KeyWords Plus:PITUITARY-DEPENDENT HYPERADRENOCORTICISM; HAIR CORTISOL; FUTURE-DIRECTIONS; STRESS RESPONSES; SALIVA CORTISOL; PLASMA-CORTISOL; DIAGNOSIS; HYPERCORTISOLISM; RATIO; PIGS","Categories":"Agriculture; Endocrinology & Metabolism Web of Science Categories:Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Endocrinology & Metabolism","Journal Information":"DOMESTIC ANIMAL ENDOCRINOLOGY Volume: 59 Pages: 53-57 DOI: 10.1016/j.domaniend.2016.11.003 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Cortisol, a glucocorticoid secreted in response to stress, is used to assess adrenal function and mental health in clinical settings.

Validation experiments demonstrated accuracy (r = 0.836, P < 0.001) precision (15.1% coefficients of variation), and repeatability (14.4% coefficients of variation) with this method. Furthermore, nail cortisol concentrations were positively correlated to an established hair cortisol method (r = 0.736, P < 0.001). Nail cortisol concentrations did not differ with dog sex, breed, age, or weights; however, sample size limitations may preclude statistical significance.

This study was conducted to evaluate biomarkers of immunometabolic health in relation to changes in physical activity and adiposity. Client-owned overweight dogs participated in a 12-wk intervention based on caloric restriction combined with a training program (fitness and diet [FD] group, n = 8), or caloric restriction alone (diet-only [DO] group, n = 8). Physical activity was monitored by accelerometry. All dogs were fed the same diet and achieved similar weight loss. Fasting blood samples were collected before and after 6- and 12-wk intervention. Insulin resistance was evaluated from plasma insulin and C-peptide as well as homeostasis model assessment. Inflammation and dyslipidemia were evaluated from circulating leptin, adiponectin, C-reactive protein (CRP), monocyte chemoattractant factor-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and cholesterol. Accelerometer counts in both groups were high compared with previous reports of physical activity in overweight dogs. No difference in blood parameters was evident between groups, evaluated by linear mixed-effects model (P > 0.05). Within the groups, the following changes were significant by t-test (P < 0.05): leptin decreased in both groups. Within the FD group, IL-8, MCP-1, and CRP decreased at 6 wk and IL-8 and cholesterol at 12 wk. Within the DO group, C-peptide and HOMA decreased at 6 wk and C-peptide at 12 wk.

Using a mating-based splitubiquitin-yeast 2-hybrid system, pull-down experiments, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, F oorster resonance energy transfer, and biotinylation assays, we found that CD63 interacts with human organic cation transporter 2 (hOCT2), which transports endogenous and exogenous substrates, such as neurotransmitters and drugs in several epithelial cells. CD63 overexpression affects cellular localization of hOCT2 expressed inhuman embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Studies with CD63-knockout mice indicate that in renal proximal tubules, CD63 determines the insertion of the mouse ortholog of the transporter into the proper membrane domain and mediates transporter regulation by trafficking processes. In polarized Madin-Darby kidney canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells, CD63 and hOCT2 colocalize with the small GTPase Rab4, which controls the rapid recycling from sorting end osomes back to the cell surface. Suitable negative and positive control experiments were performed for each experimental approach. Empty vector transfected cells and wild-type mice were used as control. CD63 seems to play a role in the recycling of hOCT2 from endosomes to the basolateral membrane in polarized epithelia. These data indicate that CD63 has a previously uncharacterized function in regulating trafficking of specific membrane proteins in polarized cells.-Schulze, U., Brast, S., Grabner, A., Albiker, C., Snieder, B., Holle, S., Schlatter, E., Schroter, R., Pavenstadt, H., Herrmann, E., Lambert, C., Spoden, G.

The inflamed mucosa is hallmarked by large, foamy, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive macrophages infiltrating the colonic mucosa. As little is known about their origin and phenotype, an immunohistochemical study was performed using different macrophage markers. Generally, canine colonic macrophages showed high expression of ionised calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 and MHC class II. In canine HUC, macrophages revealed up-regulation of lysozyme and L1 Ag but decreased CD163 expression compared with controls, suggesting them to be pro-inflammatory cells, whereas the healthy colonic mucosa was characterised by an anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype. In addition, PAS reaction was used to discriminate macrophage subpopulations. PAS(-) macrophages displayed higher expression of L1 Ag and CD64, whereas PAS(+) cells, which were only present in HUC patients, were characterised by increased expression of lysozyme, inducible nitric oxide synthase and CD204. This indicates PAS(+) cells to be mature macrophages contributing to the inflammatory process, which are most likely maintained by differentiation of immature PAS(-) macrophages continuously recruited from blood monocytes. In summary, macrophage heterogeneity in canine HUC probably illustrates their different maturation states and functions compared with the healthy animals.","Authors":"Nolte, A (Nolte, Anna) ; Junginger, J (Junginger, Johannes) ; Baum, B (Baum, Berit) ; Hewicker-Trautwein, M (Hewicker-Trautwein, Marion)","Title":"Heterogeneity of macrophages in canine histiocytic ulcerative colitis"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397498000009 PubMed ID: 27862377 ISSN: 0931-2668 eISSN: 1439-0388","Keywords":"Breeding practice; dog; gene flow; genetic variability; merging pedigree databases KeyWords Plus:POPULATION-STRUCTURE; INBREEDING COEFFICIENTS; PUREBRED DOGS; BREEDS; DIVERSITY; HEALTH; VARIABILITY; RETRIEVER","Categories":"Agriculture Web of Science Categories:Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BREEDING AND GENETICS Volume: 134 Issue: 2 Pages: 152-161 DOI: 10.1111/jbg.12242 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Merging pedigree databases across countries may improve the ability of kennel organizations to monitor genetic variability and health-related issues of pedigree dogs.

Materials and methodsData from the 11-year follow-up of the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania were used. Periodontal loss of attachment was assessed by GR and CAL. Linear regression models, adjusted for age and gender, were used to assess associations between specific landmark based distances extracted from magnetic resonance imaging head scans and clinically assessed GR or CAL (N=556).

Rapid soft tissue integration is important to create a seal around the implant and prevent infections, which commonly cause implant failure and can result in bone loss. In addition, soft tissue management is important to obtain good dental aesthetics. We previously demonstrated that the salivary peptide histatin 1 (Hst1) causes a more than 2-fold increase in the ability of human adherent cells to attach and spread on a glass surface. Cells treated with Hst1 attached more rapidly and firmly to the substrate and to each other. In the current study, we examine the potential application of Hst1 for promotion of dental implant integration. Our results show that Hst1 enhances the attachment and spreading of soft tissue cell types (oral epithelial cells and fibroblasts) to titanium (Ti) and hydroxyapatite (HAP), biomaterials that have found wide applications as implant material in dentistry and orthopedics. For improved visualization of cell adhesion to Ti, we developed a novel technique that uses sputtering to deposit a thin, transparent layer of Ti onto glass slides. This approach allows detailed, high-resolution analysis of cell adherence to Ti in real time. Furthermore, our results suggest that Hst1 has no negative effects on cell survival. Given its natural occurrence in the oral cavity, Hst1 could be an attractive agent for clinical application. Importantly, even though Hst1 is specific for saliva of humans and higher primates, it stimulated the attachment and spreading of canine cells, paving the way for preclinical studies in canine models.","Authors":"van Dijk, IA (van Dijk, I.

This study compares the long-term results of allograft versus xenograft in isolated Evan's procedure performed for correction of flexible spastic flatfoot deformity. Methods: This retrospective study accessed charts of 4- to 18-year-olds diagnosed with cerebral palsy who received an Evan's procedure. Preoperative and postoperative radiographic measurements (lateral calcaneal pitch, lateral talocalcaneal, lateral talo-first metatarsal, anteroposterior talonavicular coverage, anteroposterior talo-first metatarsal), graft incorporation, recurrence, secondary procedures, and complications were recorded and analyzed between graft types. Results: Sixty-three feet (34 allograft and 29 xenograft) in 36 patients (mean age 9.3 y) were included. Gross Motor Function Classification System between groups was significant (P = 0.001). Mean time for preoperative x-rays was 5.3 months before day of surgery (DOS) for allograft and 3.6 months for xenograft. Mean time of first and last postoperative x-ray for allograft was 3.6 and 39.5 months, respectively; for xenograft, 1.8 and 35.1 months, respectively. There was a significant difference in timing of preoperative x-ray to DOS and DOS to first postoperative x-ray (P = 0.012, 0.006, respectively).

The allograft group experienced significantly more cast pressure ulcers (P = 0.006), but no other differences in complications between groups, and no infections were reported in either group. Conclusions: Allograft incorporated better than xenograft, likely with a greater potential to reach grade 5 incorporation, yet both groups retained postoperative improvement. Results indicate both grafts are appropriate; yet incorporation rate could affect correction maintenance, and should be considered during graft selection for Evan's procedure.","Authors":"Rhodes, J (Rhodes, Jason) ; Mansour, A (Mansour, Alfred) ; Frickman, A (Frickman, Allison) ; Pritchard, B (Pritchard, Breanna) ; Flynn, K (Flynn, Katherine) ; Pan, ZX (Pan, Zhaoxing) ; Chang, F (Chang, Frank) ; Miller, N (Miller, Nancy)","Title":"Comparison of Allograft and Bovine Xenograft in Calcaneal Lengthening Osteotomy for Flatfoot Deformity in Cerebral Palsy"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397850400023 PubMed ID: 28094007 ISSN: 0022-5223 eISSN: 1097-685X","Keywords":"aorta; aneurysm; risk of rupture; echo speckle tracing; biomechanics KeyWords Plus:PHASE-CONTRAST MRI; WALL SHEAR-STRESS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; STRAIN; FLOW; COMPLICATIONS; ARTERIES; RANGES; TISSUE; CANINE","Categories":"Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Respiratory System; Surgery Web of Science Categories:Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Respiratory System; Surgery","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY Volume: 153 Issue: 4 Pages: 781-788 DOI: 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2016.11.056 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Introduction: Ex vivo measurement of ascending aortic biomechanical properties may help understand the risk for rupture or dissection of dilated ascending aortas. A validated in vivo method that can predict aortic biomechanics does not exist. Speckle tracking transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has been used to measure ventricular stiffness; we sought to determine whether speckle TEE could be adapted to estimate aortic stiffness in vivo and compare these findings with those obtained by ex vivo tissue measurements. Methods: A total of 17 patients undergoing ascending aortic resection were recruited to with a mean aortic diameter was 56.16 +/- 15 mm. Intraoperative speckle TEE tracking analysis was used to calculate aortic stiffness index using the following equation: beta 2 +/- ln (SBP/DBP)= AoS, where beta 2 is the stiffness index; SBP is systolic blood pressure; DBP is diastolic blood pressure; and AoS is the circumferential strain. Ex vivo stiffness was obtained by mechanical tissue testing according to previously described methods. The aortic ring at the pulmonary trunk was divided into 4 equal quadrants. Results: The in vivo stiffness index for the inner curvature, anterior wall, outer curvature, and posterior wall were 0.0544 +/- 0.0490, 0.0295 +/- 0.0199, 0.0411 +/- 0.0328, and 0.0502 +/- 0.0320, respectively.

Mutations in genes, such as PTEN, GLI3, SDH B/D, PIK3CA and ACT1, cause a dysfunction of the tumor suppressor gene and result in an increased neoplastic transformation. Hamartoma is a lesion between developmental disorders and benign tumors, which occurs frequently in humans, but is very rare in domestic animals. In a histopathological examination, however, it is diagnosed relatively often. In the veterinary literature, both hamartoma and choristoma are attributed mostly to errors in embryogenesis and are not considered as preneoplastic lesions.","Authors":"Bartyzel, BJ (Bartyzel, Bartlomiej J.) ; Max, A (Max, Andrzej) ; Gruszczynska, J (Gruszczynska, Joanna) ; Sobczak-Filipiak, M (Sobczak-Filipiak, Malgorzata) ; Mecik-Kronenberg, T (Mecik-Kronenberg, Tomasz) ; Pankowski, F (Pankowski, Filip)","Title":"Hamartoma: a rare developmental disorder"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398243600006 ISSN: 0025-8628","Keywords":"en bloc ovariohysterectomy; Thl/Th2 cytokine; histopathology; rats KeyWords Plus:CANINE","Categories":"Veterinary Sciences Web of Science Categories:Veterinary Sciences","Journal Information":"MEDYCYNA WETERYNARYJNA-VETERINARY MEDICINE-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE Volume: 73 Issue: 4 Pages: 225-228 DOI: 10.21521/mw.5679 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of en bloc ovariohysterectomy on the Thl/Th2 cytokine balance, as well as on visceral organ and brain histopathology in rats.

The 14 non-pregnant rats were divided into two groups: the control group (Group 1, n: 7) and the ovariohysterectomized group (Group 2, n: 7). All rats underwent en bloc ovariohysterectomy on gestational day 20-21. The 14 pregnant rats were divided into two groups: those with live infants were grouped as Group 3 and those with dead infants were grouped as Group 4. All the rats (n: 28) were decapitated at the end of one month, blood samples were obtained, and the organs were isolated. The Thl [interleukin 2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha)] and Th2 [interleukin 4 (IL-4), and interleukin 10 (IL-10)] levels in the blood sera were measured by the ELISA method, and histopathological analysis was performed on the isolated tissues. The differences between the groups were found to be insignificant with regard to IL-2, IL-4, and TNF alpha levels (p > 0.05). However, a significant difference was observed for IL-10 levels between Groups 3 and 4 (p < 0.05), and the highest IL-10 level (150.32 +/- 71.64 pg/ml) was determined in Group 4. No important pathological findings were observed in the cardiac and brain tissues of any of the animals in the histopathological examination.

This study presents the clinical, cytological, mycological, serological, and molecular findings associated with P. brasiliensis in a dog from Southern Brazil. Fine needle biopsies were collected from the skin and several lymph nodes of a 5-year-old female Labrador dog that had enlargement of most superficial lymph nodes. Cytology of the skin and lymph nodes revealed pyogranulomatous dermatitis and lymphadenitis associated with fine-necked, budding fungal structures consistent with the Paracoccidioides genus of organisms; mycological culture derived from the lymph node aspirate demonstrated similar budding structures. Serological assays using exoantigens obtained from the fungal culture demonstrated that the fungal organisms derived from the lymph node were antigenically similar to P. brasiliensis by immunodiffusion and Western blot. A PCR assay, using the fungal culture as input, amplified a partial segment of the internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 regions of P. brasiliensis; direct sequencing and phylogenetic analyses confirmed the PCR product as P. brasiliensis. The combined cytological, mycological, serological, and molecular findings confirmed a diagnosis of fungal dermatitis and lymphadenitis due to P. brasiliensis in this dog. This case represents the third description of clinical PCM in dogs and the first confirmation of mycotic dermatitis associated with P. brasiliensis in this species. The participation of dogs in the possible dissemination of PCM is reviewed, and it is proposed that dogs are probable accidental hosts in the epidemiological cycle associated with P. brasiliensis.","Authors":"Headley, SA (Headley, Selwyn Arlington) ; Pretto-Giordano, LG (Pretto-Giordano, Lucienne Garcia) ; Di Santis, GW (Di Santis, Giovana Wingeter) ; Gomes, LA (Gomes, Lucas Alecio) ; Macagnan, R (Macagnan, Rafaela) ; da Nobrega, DF (da Nobrega, Daniela Farias) ; Leite, KM (Leite, Katherine Moura) ; de Alcantara, BK (de Alcantara, Brigida Kussumoto) ; Itano, EN (Itano, Eiko Nakagawa) ; Alfieri, AA (Alfieri, Amauri Alcindo) ; Ono, MA (Ono, Mario Augusto) ...More...Less","Title":"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis-associated dermatitis and lymphadenitis in a dog"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396820300013 PubMed ID: 27167385 ISSN: 1618-1247 eISSN: 1618-1255","Keywords":"Dental arch form; Orthodontics; Normal occlusion; Beta function KeyWords Plus:DENTAL ARCH; DIGITAL MODELS; CLASS-I; SHAPE; MALOCCLUSIONS; ACCURACY; WIDTHS; AGE; TOMOGRAPHY; RETENTION","Categories":"Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine Web of Science Categories:Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine","Journal Information":"ODONTOLOGY Volume: 105 Issue: 2 Pages: 229-236 DOI: 10.1007/s10266-016-0244-7 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the dental arch curvature in subjects with normal occlusion in an Iranian population and propose a beta function formula to predict maxillary arch form using the mandibular intermolar widths (IMW) and intermolar depths (IMD).

Curve-fitting analyses were carried out and the curves passing through the facial-axis point of the canines, premolars, first molars, and the incisal edges of the anterior teeth were studied using a 3D laser scanner. Using the measured IMW and IMD of the dental arches at the maxillary and mandibular first molar region, a beta function formula proposed for predicting maxillary arch form. The accuracy of the proposed formula was assessed on 10 randomly selected dental casts. The mean (SD) of the maxillary and mandibular IMW and IMD were 57.92 (4.75), 54.19 (5.31), and 31.59 (2.90) and 28.10 (2.59) mm, respectively.

Recently, endometrial cells showing characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been demonstrated in human, pig and cow uterine tissue samples. The aim of this study was the isolation and characterization of stromal cells from the endometrium of healthy bitches, a tissue that after elective surgery is routinely discarded. Multipotent stromal cells could be isolated from all bitches enrolled in the study (n=7). The multipotency of cells was demonstrated by their capacity to differentiate into adipocytic, osteocytic and chondrocytic lineages. Clonogenicity and cell proliferation ability were also tested. Furthermore, gene expression analysis by RT-PCR was used to compare the expression of a set of genes (CD44, CD29, CD34, CD45, CD90, CD13, CD133, CD73, CD31 CD105, Oct4) with adipose tissue-derived MSC. Stromal cells isolated from uterine endometrium showed similar morphology, ability of subculture and plasticity, and also expressed a panel of genes comparable with adipose tissue-derived MSC. These data suggest that endometrial stromal cells fulfil the basic criteria proposed by the Mesenchymal and Tissue Stem Cell Committee of the International Society for Cellular Therapy for the identification of mesenchymal stem cells. Although endometrial mesenchymal stem cells (EnMSC) showed a lower replicative ability in comparison with adipose tissue-derived MSC, they could be considered a cell therapeutic agent alternative to adipose tissue or bone marrow-derived MSC in dog.","Authors":"De Cesaris, V (De Cesaris, V.) ; Grolli, S (Grolli, S.) ; Bresciani, C (Bresciani, C.) ; Conti, V (Conti, V.) ; Basini, G (Basini, G.) ; Parmigiani, E (Parmigiani, E.) ; Bigliardi, E (Bigliardi, E.)

In many stallions this technique maintains sperm quality for an extended period of time (24-72hr) at 7 degrees C. While this technique is commonly used in the horse industry, there can be a decline in fertility in some stallions, due to an inability of their sperm to tolerate the cool storage process. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effect of two natural antioxidants (epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) at 20, 60 and 120m and green tea polyphenols, and p at .001, .01 and .1mg/ml) on some sperm parameters (sperm motility, viability/acrosome integrity and DNA quality) in extended semen immediately after its collection (T0) and after 2, 6, 24 and 48hr of cool storage. Two ejaculates from three trotter stallions were analysed after 48hr of storage at 4 degrees C. No beneficial effect on the analysed parameters was observed: the two antioxidants were not able to improve sperm quality after 48hr of storage. These results are in agreement with previous findings on the effect of different antioxidants reported by other researches, who have demonstrated that stallion semen keeps good antioxidant capacity after dilution for 24hr. In conclusion, the positive effect exerted by antioxidant molecules in other species is not confirmed in the equine one.","Authors":"Bucci, D (Bucci, D.) ; Spinaci, M (Spinaci, M.) ; Mislei, B (Mislei, B.) ; Gadani, B (Gadani, B.) ; Rizzato, G (Rizzato, G.) ; Love, CC (Love, C.

We first tested cytotoxicity to define sub-cytotoxic exposure concentrations and afterwards we performed alkaline comet and cytokinesis-block micronucleus assays.

The amount of dissolved Zn ions from ZnO NPs in the cell culture medium was evaluated by an optimized voltammetric method. The results showed that all the tested zinc compounds induced similar concentration-dependent cytotoxicity, but only ZnO NPs significantly elevated DNA and chromosomal damage, which was accompanied by a reduction of GST and CAT activity. Although Zn ion release from ZnO NPs in cell culture medium was significant, our results show that this reason alone cannot explain the ZnO genotoxicity seen in this experiment. We discuss that genotoxicity of ZnO NPs depends on the particle size, which determines the physical principles of their dissolution and cellular internalisation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Loss of desmosomes and keratinocyte cohesion is a characteristic feature of DD. Desmosomal cadherins (DC) are Ca2+-dependent transmembrane adhesion proteins of desmosomes, which are mislocalized in the lesional but not perilesional skin of DD. We show here that inhibition of SERCA2 by 2 distinct inhibitors results in accumulation of DC precursors in keratinocytes, indicating ER-to-Golgi transport of nascent DC is blocked. Partial loss of SERCA2 by siRNA has no such effect, implicating that haploinsufficiency is not sufficient to affect nascent DC maturation. However, a synergistic effect is revealed between SERCA2 siRNA and an ineffective dose of SERCA2 inhibitor, and between an agonist of the ER Ca2+ release channel and SERCA2 inhibitor. These results suggest that reduction of ER Ca2+ below a critical level causes ER retention of nascent DC. Moreover, colocalization of DC with ER calnexin is detected in SERCA2-inhibited keratinocytes and DD epidermis. Collectively, our data demonstrate that loss of SERCA2 impairs ER-to-Golgi transport of nascent DC, which may contribute to DD pathogenesis.","Authors":"Li, N (Li, Ning) ; Park, M (Park, Moonhee) ; Xiao, SX (Xiao, Shengxiang) ; Liu, Z (Liu, Zhi) ; Diaz, LA (Diaz, Luis A.)","Title":"ER-to-Golgi blockade of nascent desmosomal cadherins in SERCA2-inhibited keratinocytes: Implications for Darier's disease"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396836000015 PubMed ID: 26104982 ISSN: 1865-1674 eISSN: 1865-1682","Keywords":"transboundary animal diseases; disease eradication; ranking; cluster analysis KeyWords Plus:CONTAGIOUS BOVINE PLEUROPNEUMONIA; MOUTH-DISEASE; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; AFRICA; MANAGEMENT; LIVESTOCK; PRODUCTS; WILDLIFE; CATTLE; VIRUS","Categories":"Infectious Diseases; Veterinary Sciences Web of Science Categories:Infectious Diseases; Veterinary Sciences","Journal Information":"TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES Volume: 64 Issue: 2 Pages: 459-475 DOI: 10.1111/tbed.12385 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"A matrix system was developed to aid in the evaluation of the technical amenability to eradication, through mass vaccination, of transboundary animal diseases (TADs). The system involved evaluation of three basic criteria - disease management efficiency, surveillance and epidemiological factors - each in turn comprised of a number of elements (17 in all). On that basis, 25 TADs that have occurred or do occur in southern Africa and for which vaccines are available, in addition to rinderpest (incorporated as a yardstick because it has been eradicated worldwide), were ranked. Cluster analysis was also applied using the same criteria to the 26 diseases, creating division into three groups. One cluster contained only diseases transmitted by arthropods (e.g. African horse sickness and Rift Valley fever) and considered difficult to eradicate because technologies for managing parasitic arthropods on a large scale are unavailable, while a second cluster contained diseases that have been widely considered to be eradicable [rinderpest, canine rabies, the Eurasian serotypes of foot and mouth disease virus (O, A, C & Asia 1) and peste des petits ruminants] as well classical swine fever, Newcastle disease and lumpy skin disease. The third cluster contained all the other TADs evaluated with the implication that these constitute TADs that would be more difficult to eradicate. However, it is acknowledged that the scores assigned in the course of this study may be biased. The point is that the system proposed offers an objective method for assessment of the technical eradicability of TADs; the rankings and groupings derived during this study are less important than the provision of a systematic approach for further development and evaluation.","Authors":"Thomson, GR (Thomson, G.

Studies report the presence of Lyssavirus in reservoirs of the wild cycle, highlighting the role of wild canines, marmosets, and vampire and non-vampire bats as potential vectors of the disease to domestic animals and human beings. Therefore, the reintroduction of rabies in urban environments from reservoirs of the wild cycle is a matter of concern. This study describes the profile of rabies cases documented in Brazil from 2002 to 2012, with emphasis on the wild transmission cycle of the disease. We carried out a descriptive study using records with information on the time of infection, persons with infection and location of confirmed cases of rabies in humans and animals, as well as data on anti-rabies treatments obtained from the Information System of Notifiable Diseases (Sinan) database. Within the study period, 82 cases of rabies transmitted by wild animals to humans were reported, predominantly in rural areas of the northern and north-eastern regions. Of the cases in humans, 72% did not receive post-exposure prophylaxis. Among wild mammals, vampire bats were the most frequent vectors of the disease. In the north-east region, 460 terrestrial wild mammals were reported with confirmed rabies. Over the study period, 1703 bats were reported to carry the rabies virus. In the south-east region, the most frequently reported carriers of the virus were non-vampire bats. The midwest and northern regions presented a lower number of records of rabies cases among terrestrial wild mammals. However, the high number of rabies cases among bovines reflects the role of the vampire bat as a maintainer of the rabies virus in the rural cycle. The present results are key to adjust the planning of rabies control in Brazil to the current epidemiological trends.","Authors":"Rocha, SM (Rocha, S. M.) ; de Oliveira, SV (de Oliveira, S.

Comparisons and considerations were done between findings reported herein and what was previously described as suspected hydrated nucleus pulposus extrusion and intraspinal cysts. ResultsAll dogs were presented with acute onset of cervical myelopathy. MR imaging showed compressive cervical myelopathy at C2-C3 (n=1), C3-C4 (n=6), C4-C5 (n=8), and C5-C6 (n=5) intervertebral disc spaces, due to extradural material suggestive of either partially hydrated nucleus pulposus extrusion or intraspinal discal cyst, with T2 hyperintense and T1 iso-hypointense signal and variable contrast enhancement after gadolinium injection.

Patterns of deformation were qualitatively described, and maximal deformations were compared between time points. ResultsAll cups deformed after implantation into the hemipelves by pinching in a cranial-caudal direction and dorsoventral expansion, resulting in an ellipsoid configuration to the peripheral rim.

The sample comprised 15 healthy patients (9 males and 6 females, 13.9 +/- 2.5 years). The lower (test) incisors were moved using fixed appliance carrying a 0.014-inch nickel titanium wire, whereas the upper (control) incisors were bonded without any force. The GCF was collected from the test and control teeth before fixed appliance mounting (baseline) and after 1, 7 and 21 days. In 6 sites per tooth, from canine to canine, periodontal conditions were defined as the percentage of sites with visible plaque and bleeding on probing. The total GCF cytokines levels were quantified using multianalysis Luminex technology. Throughout the experimental term, and for both test and control teeth, the mean percentage of sites with visible plaque and bleeding on probing were generally below 25% and 15%, respectively, although variability was also seen. In the test teeth, the GCF levels of all the cytokines remained constant throughout the experimental term. On the contrary, significant reductions were seen in the control teeth for each cytokine. Moreover, significantly greater levels of IL-6, GM-CSF, MCP-1 and TNF alpha were seen in the test teeth as compared to the control teeth at 7 days. The reasons for the differential behavior in the levels of all the investigated cytokines between the test and control teeth may be related to the presence of orthodontic forces and/or subclinical tissue inflammation. Further investigation is needed to elucidate potential roles for these biomarkers in the tissue remodeling incident to orthodontic tooth movement. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that the transcriptomes of canine and human bladder cancer are remarkably similar at the functional and pathway levels. We demonstrated that canine bladder cancer involves coordinated differential expression of genes within cytogenetic bands, and that these patterns are consistent with those seen in human bladder cancer. We found that genes that are mutated in canine bladder cancer are more likely to be transcriptionally downregulated than non-mutated genes, in the tumor. Finally we report three novel mutations (FAM133B, RAB3GAP2, and ANKRD52) for canine bladder cancer.","Authors":"Ramsey, SA (Ramsey, Stephen A.) ; Xu, TJ (Xu, Tanjin) ; Goodall, C (Goodall, Cheri) ; Rhodes, AC (Rhodes, Adelaide C.) ; Kashyap, A (Kashyap, Amita) ; He, J (He, Jun) ; Bracha, S (Bracha, Shay)","Title":"Cross-species analysis of the canine and human bladder cancer transcriptome and exome"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395762600005 PubMed ID: 28276119 ISSN: 0022-4510 eISSN: 1748-5827","Categories":"Veterinary Sciences Web of Science Categories:Veterinary Sciences","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF SMALL ANIMAL PRACTICE Volume: 58 Issue: 4 Pages: 219-226 DOI: 10.1111/jsap.12648 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"ObjectiveTo report the use of tibial plateau levelling osteotomy and lateral fabellotibial suture in combination for treatment of severe internal tibial rotational stifle instability in cranial cruciate-deficient stifles.

The expression of these transcription factors enables a differentiated somatic cell to reverse its phenotype to an embryonic state, generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSCs from canine fetal fibroblasts were produced through lentiviral polycistronic human and mouse vectors (hOSKM/mOSKM), aiming to obtain pluripotent stem cells with similar features to embryonic stem cells (ESC) in this animal model. The cell lines obtained in this study were independent of LIF or any other supplemental inhibitors, resistant to enzymatic procedure (TrypLE Express Enzyme), and dependent on bFGF. Clonal lines were obtained from slightly different protocols with maximum reprogramming efficiency of 0.001%. All colonies were positive for alkaline phosphatase, embryoid body formation, and spontaneous differentiation and expressed high levels of endogenous OCT4 and SOX2. Canine iPSCs developed tumors at 120 days post-injection in vivo. Preliminary chromosomal evaluations were performed by FISH hybridization, revealing no chromosomal abnormality. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to describe the ability to reprogram canine somatic cells via lentiviral vectors without supplementation and with resistance to enzymatic action, thereby demonstrating the pluripotency of these cell lines.

This study aimed to systematically review the animal studies that assessed the effect of OP-1 on disc regeneration. Relevant literature was searched in the following databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) and Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM). Animal species, disc degeneration model, OP-1 delivery method, and follow-up methodology including disc histology, disc matrix alteration, disc height, MRI T2 signal intensity and OP-1 treatment complications were extracted and reviewed. Among 15 eligible studies, direct OP-1 protein injection into the disc was reported in 10 studies whereas cell-based or viral-based OP-1 gene transfer into the disc was reported in 5 studies. Although one study using a spontaneous canine disc degeneration model reported negative findings, all other studies (10 in rabbit, 1 in canine and 3 in rat) indicated that OP-1 delivery was effective in retarding disc degeneration and regenerating discs. The adverse effect of OP-1 delivery (i.e., extradiscal new bone formation) was reported in one study. In conclusion, OP-1 delivery offers a feasible option to biologically treat degenerated discs in animals, especially in rodent rabbit and rat models. However, more animal studies are needed to test the safety of the current OP-1 delivery means. Additionally, care should be taken when OP-1 delivery is used to treat human disc degeneration due to the differences between human and animal discs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Several types of dural substitute materials have recently been discarded or modified owing to poor biocompatibility or medianical properties and adverse reactions. The small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a promising material used in a variety of applications. Based on the limitations of previous studies, we conducted an animal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the SIS in preclinical trials. Twenty-four Male beagle dogs were subjected to surgical resection to produce dural defects. SIS or autologous dural mater was patched on the dural defect. Gross and histological evaluations were carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the therapy. Our findings demonstrated that the SIS, which stimulated connective and epithelial tissue responses for dural regeneration and functional recovery without immunological rejection, could provide prolonged defect repair and prevent complications. The mechanical prdperties of the SIS could be adjusted by application of multiple layers, and the biocompatibility of the material was appropriate. Thus, our data suggested that this material may represent an alternative option for clinical treatment of dural defects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A major virulence determinant of the strains associated with these diseases appears to be a beta-sheet poreforming toxin, NetF, encodedwithin a pathogenicity locus (NetF locus) on a large tcp-conjugative plasmid. Strains producing NetF also produce the putative toxin NetE, encoded within the same pathogenicity locus, as well as CPE enterotoxin and CPB2 on a second plasmid, and sometimes the putative toxin NetG within a pathogenicity locus (NetG locus) on another separate large conjugative plasmid. Previous genome sequences of two netF-positive C. perfringens showed that they both shared three similar plasmids, including the NetF/NetE and CPE/CPB2 toxins-encoding plasmids mentioned above and a putative bacteriocin-encoding plasmid. The main purpose of this studywas to determinewhether all NetF-producing strains share this common plasmid profile andwhether their distinct NetF and CPE pathogenicity loci are conserved. To answer this question, 15 equine and 15 canine netF-positive isolates of C. perfringens were sequenced using Illumina Hiseq2000 technology. In addition, the clonal relationships among the NetF-producing strainswere evaluated by core genomemultilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). The data obtained showed that all NetF-producing strains have a common plasmid profile and that the defined pathogenicity loci on the plasmids are conserved in all these strains. cgMLST analysis showed that the NetF-producing C. perfringens strains belong to twodistinct clonal complexes. The pNetG plasmidwas absent fromisolates of one of the clonal complexes, and there were minor but consistent differences in the NetF/NetE and CPE/CPB2 plasmids between the two clonal complexes.

Since canine hapacivirus, NPHV identified in dogs, was first discovered in dogs in the United States, equine hepacivirus (EqHV, NPHV identified in horses) has been identified in horses in several countries. However, no epidemiological studies have investigated EqHV in horses in Korea. In this study, a total of 74 (n = 74) serum samples collected from horses in four regions of Korea were tested for EqHV RNA using nested RT-PCR. Overall, 14 samples were identified as positive (18.9%) and further analyzed according to gender, age, breed, and region. There were high positive rates in males, young horses, and Thoroughbreds; however, these rates differed regionally. Sequencing of the partial NS3 region of 12 samples and the polyprotein encoding regions of two samples positive for EqHV RNA revealed that the Korean EqHV isolates shared approximately 85.3-99.6% and 97.7-100% homology at the nucleotide and deduced amino acid level, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the partial NS3 genes clustered with sequences previously reported as NPHV. Notably, sequences of EqHV detected in horses in the same region showed sequence divergence. The sequences of the polyprotein encoding region of two representative EqHVs shared 83.9% and 95.7% homology with each other at the nucleotide and deduced amino acid level, respectively. Comparison of the sequences of polyprotein encoding regions of Korean EqHV isolates and hepaciviruses from different hosts revealed that the NS3 and NS5B regions were most conserved among hepaciviruses. The results of the present study demonstrate that there is a high positive rate of EqHV in Korea and provide significant information regarding the geographical distribution and genetic variability of Korean EqHV isolates that will help improve global epidemiology of EqHV.

The disease can be clinically classified into uncomplicated and complicated forms. The aim of this study was to assess the level of endothelial activation and alterations in the fibrinolytic pathway during canine babesiosis. Results: Blood samples were collected on the day of admission and on the 6th day after treatment with imidocarb propionate, from 30 dogs of various breeds and of both sexes with naturally occurring babesiosis caused by B. canis. In this prospective study, plasminogen activity was assessed using a chromogenic assay, and concentrations of high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB-1), intercellular adhesive molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular adhesive molecule-1 (VCAM-1), soluble urokinase receptor of plasminogen activator (suPAR), thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), soluble thrombomodulin (TM) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were determined using a canine specific ELISA. Concentrations of TM, HMGB-1, VCAM-1 and suPAR were increased in dogs with babesiosis at admission compared to healthy dogs. After treatment, concentrations of TM were lower in infected dogs compared to healthy dogs. Dogs with babesiosis also had increased concentrations of TM, ICAM-1 and HMGB-1 and decreased plasminogen and PAI-1 at presentation compared to day 6 after treatment. Dogs with complicated babesiosis had higher concentrations of TM, HMGB1 and TAFI at admission compared to the 6th day. Conclusions: Biomarkers of endothelial activation and fibrinolysis were altered in dogs with babesiosis.

However, the non-chondrodystrophic canine intervertebral disc is protected from the development of DDD, ostensibly due to its retention of notochordal cells (NC) in the nucleus pulposus (NP). In this study, we hypothesized that secretome analysis of the NC-rich NP will lead to the identification of key proteins that delay the onset of DDD. Using mass- spectrometry, we identified 303 proteins including components of TGF beta-and Wnt- signaling, anti- angiogeneic factors and proteins that inhibit axonal ingrowth in the bioactive fractions of serum free, notochordal cell derived conditioned medium (NCCM). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed TGF beta 1 and CTGF as major hubs in protein interaction networks. In vitro treatment with TGF beta 1 and CTGF promoted the synthesis of healthy extra- cellular matrix proteins, increased cell proliferation and reduced cell death in human degenerative disc NP cells. A single intradiscal injection of recombinant TGF beta 1 and CTGF proteins in a pre-clinical rat-tail disc injury model restored the NC and stem cell rich NP. In conclusion, we demonstrate the potential of TGF beta 1 and CTGF to mitigate the progression of disc degeneration and the potential use of these molecules in a molecular therapy to treat the degenerative disc.","Authors":"Matta, A (Matta, Ajay) ; Karim, MZ (Karim, M.

MF is widely used in traditional medicine to treat inflammation and helminthic infection and has anti-bacterial, anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic activities. However, potential anti-influenza properties of MF have yet to be investigated. We determined whether an ethanolic extract of MF (EMF) has anti-viral activity via an EMF pre-, co-, and post-treatment assay, using the Influenza A/PR/8/34 and H3N2 virus on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The EMF had antiinfluenza virus activity in pre-and co-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner, but not in post-treated cell. EMF inhibited the activity of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of influenza virus. EMF inhibited viral HA, nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein 2 (M2), non-structural protein 1 (NS1), polymerase acidic protein (PA), polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), and polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) mRNA synthesis at 5 h post infection (hpi), however, the levels of PA, PB1, and PB2 mRNA were increased in pre-and co-EMF treated cells compared with control virus-infected and EMF post-treated cells at 18 hpi. The level of M2 protein expression was also decreased upon pre-and co-treatment with EMF. The PA protein was accumulated and localized in not only the nucleus but also the cytoplasm of virus-infected MDCK cells at 18 hpi. Pre-EMF treatment inhibited the expression of pAKT, which is induced by influenza virus infection, at the stage of virus entry. We also found that treatment of EMF up-regulated the antiviral protein Mx1, which may play a partial role in inhibiting influenza virus infection in pre-and co-EMF treated MDCK cells. In summary, these results strongly suggested that an ethanolic extract of Meliae Fructus inhibited influenza A virus infection by affecting viral entry, PA proteins of the RNA polymerase complex, and Mx1 induction and may be a potential and novel anti-influenza agent.","Authors":"Jin, YH (Jin, Young-Hee) ; Choi, JG (Choi, Jang-Gi) ; Cho, WK (Cho, Won-Kyung) ; Ma, JY (Ma, Jin Yeul)","Title":"Ethanolic Extract of Melia Fructus Has Anti-influenza A Virus Activity by Affecting Viral Entry and Viral RNA Polymerase"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397538800002 PubMed ID: 28349955 ISSN: 2045-2322","Categories":"Science & Technology - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:Multidisciplinary Sciences","Journal Information":"SCIENTIFIC REPORTS Volume: 7 Article Number: 45357 DOI: 10.1038/srep45357 Published: MAR 28 2017","Abstract":"Postintubation tracheal stenosis is a complication of endotracheal intubation.

Beagles were intubated with 4 sized tubes (internal diameter 6.5 to 8.0 mm) and cuff pressures of 100 to 200 mmHg for 24 hr.

The model was successfully established by cuffed endotracheal intubation using an 8.0 mm tube and an intra-cuff pressure of 200 mmHg for 24 hr. When the intra-cuff pressures were kept constant, a larger sized tube would induce a larger tracheal wall pressure and more severe injury to the tracheal wall. The degree of tracheal stenosis ranged from 78% to 91% at 2 weeks postextubation. Histological examination demonstrated submucosal infiltration of inflammatory cells, hyperplasia of granulation tissue and collapse of tracheal cartilage. In summary, a novel animal model of tracheal stenosis was established by cuffed endotracheal intubation, whose histopathological feathers are similar to those of clinical cases of postintubation tracheal stenosis.
