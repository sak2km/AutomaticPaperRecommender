The integration of a user's context and intentions into the search process is one of the most promising approaches to enhance current search interfaces and algorithms. In this article, we present the results of two exploratory studies on the topic of online video searching, retrieving, watching, and sharing: a qualitative study in which 22 participants reported on situations when they retrieved and watched videos, and an online quantitative survey with more than 200 participants answering comparable questions. We provide a detailed analysis of the results from both studies and report on the insights that they provide in terms of video search, retrieval, watching, and sharing behavior. Our findings can be used to enhance current video retrieval systems, search interfaces, and algorithms in order to improve the overall user satisfaction and experience. As an example of such improvements, we also propose a prototype that addresses the problem of taking the user's intentions into account when designing video retrieval interfaces.","Authors":"Lagger, C (Lagger, Christoph) ; Lux, M (Lux, Mathias) ; Marques, O (Marques, Oge)","Title":"What Makes People Watch Online Videos: An Exploratory Study"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396950100004 ISSN: 0167-739X eISSN: 1872-7115","Keywords":"Parallel processing; Computer software; Software engineering; Software development environment and technique; Distributed programming and environment SunwayMR KeyWords Plus:CLUSTERS","Categories":"Computer Science Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Journal Information":"FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE Volume: 71 Pages: 43-56 DOI: 10.1016/j.future.2017.01.018 Published: JUN 2017","Abstract":"Managing servers integration to realize distributed data computing framework is an important concern. Regardless of the underlying architecture and the actual distributed system's complexity, such framework gives programmers an abstract view of systems to achieve variously data-intensive applications. However, some state-of-the-art frameworks need too much library dependencies and parameters configuration, or lack extensibility in application programming. Moreover, general framework's precise design is a nontrivial work, which is fraught with challenges of task scheduling, message communication and computing efficiency, etc. To address these problems, we present a general, scalable and programmable parallel computing framework called SunwayMR, which only needs GCC/G++ environment. We argue it from the following aspects: (1) Distributed data partitioning, message communication and task organization are given to support transparent application execution on parallel hardware. By searching threads table of each node, the task gets an idle thread (with preferred node IP address) for executing data partition. A novel communication component, SunwayMRHelper, is employed to merge periodical results synchronously. Through identifying whether current node is master or slave, SunWayMR deals with the periodical task's results differently. (2) As for optimizations, a simple fault tolerance is given to resume data-parallel applications, and thread-level stringstream is utilized to boost computing. To ensure ease-of-use, open Application Programming Interface (API) excerpts can be invoked by various of applications with fewer handwritten code than OpenMPl/MPI. We conduct extensively experimental studies to evaluate the performance of SunwayMR over real-world datasets. Results indicate that SunwayMR (runs on 16 computational nodes) outperforms Spark in various applications, and has good scaling with data sizes, nodes and threads. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Since the use of tributyltin compounds in antifouling coatings was banned in 2003, the search for ecofriendly alternatives has been promoted. Foul-release (FR) nanocoatings have been extensively investigated because of their non-stick, ecological, and economic advantages. Such nanocomposite systems are dynamic non-stick surfaces that deter any fouling attachment through physical anti-adhesion terminology. Instead of biocidal solutions, several functional FR nanocomposite coatings have been developed to counter biofouling and biocorrosion with ecological and ecofriendly effects. Selected inorganic nanofillers have been incorporated because of their enhanced interaction at the filler-polymer interface for nanocomposites. Metallic nanoparticles and their oxides have also been widely explored because of their unique morphological characteristics and size-dependent, self-cleaning properties. In modeling a novel series of FR nanocoatings, two modes of prevention are combined: chemical inertness and physical microfouling repulsion for maritime navigation applications. Long-term durability and self-cleaning performance are among the advantages of developing effective, stable, and ecofriendly modeling alternatives. This review provides a holistic overview of nano-FR research achievements and describes recent advancements in non-stick marine nanocoatings for ship hulls. This review highlights the key issues of nanocomposite structures and their features in improving the biological activity and surface self-cleaning performance of ship hulls. This review may also open new horizons toward futuristic developments in FR nanocomposites for maritime navigations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Authors":"Selim, MS (Selim, M.

Current code-focused information retrieval systems such as Google Code Search, Codeplex or Koders produce results based on specific keywords. However, these systems do not take into account developers' context such as development language, technology framework, goal of the project, project complexity and developer's domain expertise. They also impose additional cognitive burden on users in switching between different interfaces and clicking through to find the relevant code. Hence, they are not used by software developers. In this paper, we discuss how software engineers interact with information and general-purpose information retrieval systems (e.g. Google, Yahoo!) and investigate to what extent domain-specific search and recommendation utilities can be developed in order to support their work-related activities. In order to investigate this, we conducted a user study and found that software engineers followed many identifiable and repeatable work tasks and behaviours. These behaviours can be used to develop implicit relevance feedback-based systems based on the observed retention actions. Moreover, we discuss the implications for the development of task-specific search and collaborative recommendation utilities embedded with the Google standard search engine and Microsoft IntelliSense for retrieval and re-engineering of code. Based on implicit relevance feedback, we have implemented a prototype of the proposed collaborative recommendation system, which was evaluated in a controlled environment simulating the real-world situation of professional software engineers. The evaluation has achieved promising initial results on the precision and recall performance of the system.","Authors":"Iqbal, R (Iqbal, Rahat) ; Grzywaczewski, A (Grzywaczewski, Adam) ; Halloran, J (Halloran, John) ; Doctor, F (Doctor, Faiyaz) ; Iqbal, K (Iqbal, Kashif)","Title":"Design implications for task-specific search utilities for retrieval and re-engineering of code"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395201300006 PubMed ID: 27706951 ISSN: 0963-7486 eISSN: 1465-3478","Keywords":"Obesity; diabetes; aqueous extract; cinnamon; clove KeyWords Plus:ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITORS; EMULSIFIED TRIBUTYRIN; DICAPRIN MONOLAYERS; LIPOLYSIS; PROTEINS; PREVENTION; ACARBOSE; ACID; TEA","Categories":"Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics Web of Science Categories:Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics","Journal Information":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCES AND NUTRITION Volume: 68 Issue: 3 Pages: 313-320 DOI: 10.1080/09637486.2016.1237479 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"The aim of this study is to search new anti-obesity and anti-diabetic agents from plant and spices crude extracts as alternative to synthetic drugs.

In particular, global optimization methods are of major importance to search for the low-energy structures of molecular aggregates.

Several sequence-based in silico approaches tap the existing data on experimentally validated protein-protein interactions (PPIs); these PPIs serve as templates from which novel interactions between pathogen and host are inferred. Such comparative approaches typically make use of local sequence alignment, which, in the absence of structural details about the interfaces mediating the template interactions, could lead to incorrect inferences, particularly when multi-domain proteins are involved. Results: We propose leveraging the domain-domain interaction (DDI) information in PDB complexes to score and prioritize candidate PPIs between host and pathogen proteomes based on targeted sequence-level comparisons. Our method picks out a small set of human-MTB protein pairs as candidates for physical interactions, and the use of functional meta-data suggests that some of them could contribute to the in vivo molecular cross-talk between pathogen and host that regulates the course of the infection. Further, we present numerical data for Pfam domain families that highlights interaction specificity on the domain level. Not every instance of a pair of domains, for which interaction evidence has been found in a few instances (i.e. structures), is likely to functionally interact. Our sorting approach scores candidates according to how \"distant\" they are in sequence space from known examples of DDIs (templates). Thus, it provides a natural way to deal with the heterogeneity in domain-level interactions. Conclusions: Our method represents a more informed application of local alignment to the sequence-based search for potential human-microbial interactions that uses available PPI data as a prior. Our approach is somewhat limited in its sensitivity by the restricted size and diversity of the template dataset, but, given the rapid accumulation of solved protein complex structures, its scope and utility are expected to keep steadily improving.","Authors":"Mahajan, G (Mahajan, Gaurang) ; Mande, SC (Mande, Shekhar C.)","Title":"Using structural knowledge in the protein data bank to inform the search for potential host-microbe protein interactions in sequence space: application to Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397851600004 ISSN: 1093-9687 eISSN: 1467-8667","Categories":"Computer Science; Construction & Building Technology; Engineering; Transportation Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil; Transportation Science & Technology","Journal Information":"COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING Volume: 32 Issue: 4 Pages: 319-343 DOI: 10.1111/mice.12224 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Given a set of candidate road projects associated with costs, finding the best subset with respect to a limited budget is known as the network design problem (NDP).

A variety of exact solutions has been proposed for the discrete NDP, but due to the combinatorial complexity, the literature has yet to address the problem for large-size networks, and accounting for the multimodal and multiclass traffic flows. To this end, the bilevel problem is solved by branch-and-bound. At each node of the search tree, a valid lower bound based on system optimal (SO) traffic flow is calculated.

And the third is the human ability in unconscious decision making when encountering pictorial challenges. This work models such complicated human patterns in problem solving for the first time. In order to extract these behavioural patterns and save them in a pattern database, we have implemented our own captcha and performed a series of experiments. PiSHi's interface presents the user with a set of distorted pictures and asks her to click on the upright orientation of all the pictures in any preferred order. Next, it captures the user's interaction patterns, compares them with the ones saved in the pattern database, and grants her a corresponding credit. Based on this credit, the user either passes or fails the test, and participates in updating the picture database.

It is especially relevant in the context of modern (ongoing and prospective) studies that generate heterogeneous high-throughput omics datasets. However, there are both theoretical and practical obstacles to the seamless application of BN modeling to such big data, including computational inefficiency of optimal BN structure search algorithms, ambiguity in data discretization, mixing data types, imputation and validation, and, in general, limited scalability in both reconstruction and visualization of BNs. To overcome these and other obstacles, we present BNOmics, an improved algorithm and software toolkit for inferring and analyzing BNs from omics datasets. BNOmics aims at comprehensive systems biology-type data exploration, including both generating new biological hypothesis and testing and validating the existing ones. Novel aspects of the algorithm center around increasing scalability and applicability to varying data types (with different explicit and implicit distributional assumptions) within the same analysis framework.

Multiple orientation relationships (ORs) corresponding to various faceted interfaces tend to coexist in one alloy. A near row matching (NRM) approach is proposed for a systematic investigation of ORs corresponding to potential preferred interfaces. Unlike a common practice to search for misorientations corresponding to low sigma grain boundaries associated with matching periodicity in three dimensions (3D), this approach directly searches for ORs that permit local 2D periodic good matching structures in preferred interfaces. The calculation method consists of two simple steps to evaluate matching within and between rows of lattice points. The method has been applied to a Mg2Sn/Mg system. Ten of the forty-four predicted facets agree with the experimental observations, for the cases that the preferred facets can be described (approximately) by low index planes of the precipitates. The predictions can cover all known observations, if limited high index planes are included as candidates. Each observed facet is characterized with a periodic pattern of good matching sites (GMSs) in localized regions. NRM is a necessary condition for the existence of a periodic GMS pattern. The agreement between the calculation results and experimental results confirms the important role of periodic matching in the development of preferred interfaces and their corresponding ORs. It also demonstrates the usefulness of geometric matching study for quantitative predictions of potential preferred interfaces.","Authors":"Zhang, WZ (Zhang, W.

The as-prepared Pt2Pd/NPG exhibits prominent onset potential, excellent stability, good kinetic current density, and remarkable corrosion resistance to HER and ORR. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the remarkably enhanced performance of Pt2Pd/NPG originated from the robust conjugation between the Pt2Pd alloy nanoparticles and nitrogen-rich graphene nanopores, thereby leading to the synergistic effect of both interfaces. The nanopores also modulate the electronic properties of Pt2Pd alloy nanoparticles, which improve the durability during HER and ORR.

Multi-modal features related to bonding quality are contained in structural vibration response signal. Different modal feature has different sensitivity to the bonding quality. Extracting the desired mono-modal feature from the vibration response signal is necessary. Due to the mode aliasing easily appeared in the process of extracting the desired mono-modal feature, there is no effective method for this task. Dual-tree complex wavelet with attractive properties such as shift invariance and reduced spectral aliasing may provide a better way to extract the mono-modal feature. However, the fixed basis functions independent of the analyzed signal may weak the advantage of the method and even reduce the accuracy of detection result To overcome this shortcoming, a technique called optimized dual-tree complex wavelet transform (ODTCWT) is proposed in this paper. Based on the analyzed signal, the optimized dual-tree complex wavelet basis function is constructed by searching for the proper parameters of vanishing moment K and the order of filter L. The optimized dual-tree complex wavelet with improved wavelet filters can best matched the modal frequencies of the analyzed signal. The ODTCWT can extract the mono-modal feature from vibration response signal with lower mode aliasing. The feasibility and effectiveness of the method of constructing ODTCWT is illustrated by the simulated signal. The proposed ODTCWT is combined with time entropy to detecting bonding quality of explosive clad pipes. For comparison, un-optimized dual-tree complex wavelet transform (UODTCWT), second-generation wavelet transform (SGWT) and bandpass filter (BPF) are also used for this task to demonstrate the validity of ODTCWT.

Formation of the pre-catalytic spliceosomal B complex involves the incorporation of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP and of a group of non-snRNP B-specific proteins. While in Saccharomyces cerevisiae the Prp38 and Snu23 proteins are recruited as components of the tri-snRNP, metazoan orthologs of Prp38 and Snu23 associate independently of the tri-snRNP as members of the B-specific proteins. The human spliceosome contains about 80 proteins that lack obvious orthologs in yeast, including most of the B-specific proteins apart from Prp38 and Snu23. Conversely, the tri-snRNP protein Spp381 is one of only five S. cerevisiae splicing factors without a known human ortholog. Results: Using InParanoid, a state-of-the-art method for ortholog inference between pairs of species, and systematic BLAST searches we identified the human B-specific protein MFAP1 as a putative ortholog of the S. cerevisiae tri-snRNP protein Spp381. Bioinformatics revealed that MFAP1 and Spp381 share characteristic structural features, including intrinsic disorder, an elongated shape, solvent exposure of most residues and a trend to adopt alpha-helical structures. In vitro binding studies showed that human MFAP1 and yeast Spp381 bind their respective Prp38 proteins via equivalent interfaces and that they cross-interact with the Prp38 proteins of the respective other species. Furthermore, MFAP1 and Spp381 both form higher-order complexes that additionally include Snu23, suggesting that they are parts of equivalent spliceosomal sub-complexes. Finally, similar to yeast Spp381, human MFAP1 partially rescued a growth defect of the temperature-sensitive mutant yeast strain prp38-1. Conclusions: Human B-specific protein MFAP1 structurally and functionally resembles the yeast tri-snRNP-specific protein Spp381 and thus qualifies as its so far missing ortholog. Our study indicates that the yeast Snu23-Prp38-Spp381 triple complex was evolutionarily reprogrammed from a tri-snRNP-specific module in yeast to the B-specific Snu23-Prp38-MFAP1 module in metazoa, affording higher flexibility in spliceosome assembly and thus, presumably, in splicing regulation.","Authors":"Ulrich, AKC (Ulrich, Alexander K.

At different frequencies, two types of anomalies are observed: a spectral tip and a spectral dip, which correspond, respectively, to the brighter band and the darker band in optical Wood anomalies. The search for their physical origin suggests that the type and location of the observed spectral anomalies are strongly related to the generation and the diffraction of pseudosurface waves on the interface having superimposed periodic corrugations and time-domain windowing in spectral analysis.

We argue that the newly observed broad-band emission of liquid water is relevant in search of extraterrestrial life, and we also envision the observed electron-ejection mechanism to find application for exploring solutes at liquid vapor interfaces.","Authors":"Hans, A (Hans, Andreas) ; Ozga, C (Ozga, Christian) ; Seidel, R (Seidel, Robert) ; Schmidt, P (Schmidt, Philipp) ; Ueltzhoffer, T (Ueltzhoeffer, Timo) ; Holzapfel, X (Holzapfel, Xaver) ; Wenzel, P (Wenzel, Philip) ; Reiss, P (Reiss, Philipp) ; Pohl, MN (Pohl, Marvin N.) ; Unger, I (Unger, Isaak) ; Aziz, EF (Aziz, Emad F.) ; Ehresmann, A (Ehresmann, Arno) ; Slavicek, P (Slavicek, Petr) ; Winter, B (Winter, Bernd) ; Knie, A (Knie, Andre) ...More...Less Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number Ehresmann, Arno  E-6853-2010 http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0981-2289 Slavicek, Petr  B-7511-2008  ","Title":"Optical Fluorescence Detected from X-ray Irradiated Liquid Water"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396814700001 ISSN: 2048-7703","Keywords":"Mobile applications; Machine learning; Data mining; Recommender systems; Context awareness","Categories":"Engineering Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Journal Information":"APSIPA TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL AND INFORMATION PROCESSING Volume: 6 Pages: 1-10 DOI: 10.1017/ATSIP.2017.2 Published: MAR 15 2017","Abstract":"We are currently living in a world dominated by mobile apps and connected devices. State-of-the-art mobile phones and tablets use apps to organize knowledge and information, control devices, and/or complete transactions via local, web, and cloud services. However, users are challenged to select a suite of apps, from the millions available today, that is right for them. Apps are increasingly differentiated only by the user experience and a few specialized functions; therefore, many apps are needed in order to cover all of the services a specific user needs, and the user is often required to frequently switch between apps to achieve a specific goal. User experience is further limited by the inability of apps to effectively interoperate, since relevant user data are often wholly contained within the app. This limitation significantly undermines the continuous (function) flow across apps to achieve a desired goal. The result is a disjointed user experience requiring app switching and replicating data among apps. With these limitations in mind, it appears as if the current mobile experience is nearing its full potential but failing to leverage the full power of modern mobile devices. In this paper, we present a vision of the future where apps are no longer the dominant customer interaction in the mobile world. The alternative that we propose would \"orchestrate\" the mobile experience by using a \"moment-first\" model that would leverage machine learning and data mining to bridge a user's needs across app boundaries, matching context, and knowledge of the user with ideal services and interaction models between the user and device. In this way, apps would be employed at a function level, while the overall user experience would be optimized, by liberating user data outside of the app container and intelligently orchestrating the user experience, to fulfill the needs of the moment. We introduce the concept of a functional entry-point and apply the simple label \"FUNN\" to it (which was named \"FUNC\" in (Wang, 2014)). We further discuss how a number of learning models could be utilized in building this relationship between the user, FUNN, and context to enable search, recommendations and presentation of FUNNs through a multi-modal human-machine interface that would better fulfill users' needs. Two examples are showcased to demonstrate how this vision is being implemented in home entertainment and driving scenarios. In conclusion, we envision moving forward into a FUNN-based mobile world with a much more intelligent user experience model. This in turn would offer the opportunity for new relationships and business models between software developers, OS providers, and device manufacturers.","Authors":"Wang, HH (Wang, Haohong)","Title":"A mobile world made of functions"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397986500022 PubMed ID: 28011769 ISSN: 1367-4803 eISSN: 1460-2059","Categories":"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Computer Science; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Mathematics Web of Science Categories:Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Statistics & Probability","Journal Information":"BIOINFORMATICS Volume: 33 Issue: 6 Pages: 935-937 DOI: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btw756 Published: MAR 15 2017","Abstract":"The PPI3D web server is focused on searching and analyzing the structural data on protein-protein interactions.

Here, we clarify the conditions under which measurements and perturbations support causal inferences. We note that the brain functions at multiple scales and that causal dependencies may be best inferred with perturbation tools that interface with the system at the appropriate scale. Finally, we develop a geometric framework to facilitate the interpretation of causal experiments when brain perturbations do or do not respect the intrinsic patterns of brain activity.

The following key words were used, with associations among them: \"dental implant,'' \"dental implants,'' \"Osstell,'' \"resonance frequency analysis,'' \"implant stability quotient,'' \"ISQ,'' \"Periotest,'' \"Periotest value,'' and \"PTV.'' Inclusion criteria were English language, prospective, retrospective, and randomized controlled clinical trials that evaluated implant stability through use of resonance frequency analysis (RFA) and damping capacity analysis (DCA). The study should assess implant stability of only a specific region for all patients or discriminate results evaluated for each region if the analysis had been made in various regions; RFA and DCA should have been applied in the same implants and periods. Studies have been carefully selected, and data of interest were tabulated. Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Although there was significant numerical correlation between values obtained by both methods, data showed that less than half (46%) of cases coincided in relation to implant stability classification.

Materials and methods: We searched bibliographic databases including Scopus, PubMed, and Science Citation Index Expanded from January 2004 to December 2015 for studies reporting problems with IT and their effects. A framework called the information value chain, which connects technology use to final outcome, was used to assess how IT problems affect user interaction, information receipt, decision-making, care processes, and patient outcomes. The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Results: Of the 34 studies identified, the majority (n = 14, 41%) were analyses of incidents reported from 6 countries. There were 7 descriptive studies, 9 ethnographic studies, and 4 case reports. The types of IT problems were similar to those described in earlier classifications of safety problems associated with health IT. The frequency, scale, and severity of IT problems were not adequately captured within these studies. Use errors and poor user interfaces interfered with the receipt of information and led to errors of commission when making decisions. Clinical errors involving medications were well characterized. Issues with system functionality, including poor user interfaces and fragmented displays, delayed care delivery. Issues with system access, system configuration, and software updates also delayed care. In 18 studies (53%), IT problems were linked to patient harm and death. Near-miss events were reported in 10 studies (29%). Discussion and conclusion: The research evidence describing problems with health IT remains largely qualitative, and many opportunities remain to systematically study and quantify risks and benefits with regard to patient safety. The information value chain, when used in conjunction with existing classifications for health IT safety problems, can enhancemeasurement and should facilitate identification of the most significant risks to patient safety.","Authors":"Kim, MO (Kim, Mi Ok) ; Coiera, E (Coiera, Enrico) ; Magrabi, F (Magrabi, Farah)","Title":"Problems with health information technology and their effects on care delivery and patient outcomes: a systematic review"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396148800006 ISSN: 1783-7677 eISSN: 1783-8738","Keywords":"Multimodal feedback; Multi-robot systems; Psychophysical evaluation; Bilateral teleoperation; Outdoor environment KeyWords Plus:BILATERAL TELEOPERATION; USER-INTERFACE; REAL-TIME; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN","Categories":"Computer Science Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Cybernetics","Journal Information":"JOURNAL ON MULTIMODAL USER INTERFACES Volume: 11 Issue: 1 Pages: 67-80 DOI: 10.1007/s12193-016-0230-y Published: MAR 2017","Abstract":"Better situational awareness helps understand remote environments and achieve better performance in the teleoperation of multiple mobile robots (e.g., a group of unmanned aerial vehicles). Visual and force feedbacks are the most common ways of perceiving the environments accurately and effectively; however, accurate and adequate sensors for global localization are impractical in outdoor environments. Lack of this information hinders situational awareness and operating performance. In this paper, a visual and force feedback method is proposed for enhancing the situational awareness of human operators in outdoor multi-robot teleoperation. Using only the robots' local information, the global view is fabricated from individual local views, and force feedback is determined by the velocity of individual units. The proposed feedback method is evaluated via two psychophysical experiments: maneuvering and searching tests using a human/hardware-in-the-loop system with simulated environments. In the tests, several quantitative measures are also proposed to assess the human operator's maneuverability and situational awareness. Results of the two experiments show that the proposed multimodal feedback enhances only situational awareness of the operator.","Authors":"Hong, A (Hong, Ayoung) ; Lee, D (Lee, Dong Gun) ; Buelthoff, HH (Buelthoff, Heinrich H.) ; Son, HI (Son, Hyoung Il)","Title":"Multimodal feedback for teleoperation of multiple mobile robots in an outdoor environment"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397044000037 PubMed ID: 28345050 ISSN: 2375-2548","Categories":"Science & Technology - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:Multidisciplinary Sciences","Journal Information":"SCIENCE ADVANCES Volume: 3 Issue: 3 Article Number: e1602312 DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.1602312 Published: MAR 2017","Abstract":"The Rashba physics has been intensively studied in the field of spin orbitronics for the purpose of searching novel physical properties and the ferromagnetic (FM) magnetization switching for technological applications.

The temperate Earth-mass planet Proxima b is the closest exoplanet to Earth and represents what may be our best ever opportunity to search for life outside the Solar System. Aims. We aim at directly detecting Proxima b and characterizing its atmosphere by spatially resolving the planet and obtaining high-resolution reflected-light spectra. Methods. We propose to develop a coupling interface between the SPHERE high-contrast imager and the new ESPRESSO spectrograph, both installed at ESO VLT. The angular separation of 37 mas between Proxima b and its host star requires the use of visible wavelengths to spatially resolve the planet on a 8.2-m telescope. At an estimated planet-to-star contrast of similar to 10 7 in reflected light, Proxima b is extremely challenging to detect with SPHERE alone. However, the combination of a similar to 10(3)-10(4) contrast enhancement from SPHERE to the high spectral resolution of ESPRESSO can reveal the planetary spectral features and disentangle them from the stellar ones. Results. We find that significant but realistic upgrades to SPHERE and ESPRESSO would enable a 5 sigma detection of the planet and yield a measurement of its true mass and albedo in 20-40 nights of telescope time, assuming an Earth-like atmospheric composition. Moreover, it will be possible to probe the O-2 bands at 627, 686 and 760 nm, the water vapour band at 717 nm, and the methane band at 715 nm. In particular, a 3.6 sigma detection of O-2 could be made in about 60 nights of telescope time. Those would need to be spread over three years considering optimal observability conditions for the planet. Conclusions. The very existence of Proxima b and the SPHERE-ESPRESSO synergy represent a unique opportunity to detect biosignatures on an exoplanet in the near future. It is also a crucial pathfinder experiment for the development of extremely large telescopes and their instruments, in particular the E-ELT and its high-resolution visible and near-IR spectrograph.","Authors":"Lovis, C (Lovis, C.) ; Snellen, I (Snellen, I.) ; Mouillet, D (Mouillet, D.) ; Pepe, F (Pepe, F.) ; Wildi, F (Wildi, F.) ; Astudillo-Defru, N (Astudillo-Defru, N.) ; Beuzit, JL (Beuzit, J. -L.) ; Bonfils, X (Bonfils, X.) ; Cheetham, A (Cheetham, A.) ; Conod, U (Conod, U.) ; Delfosse, X (Delfosse, X.) ; Ehrenreich, D (Ehrenreich, D.) ; Figueira, P (Figueira, P.) ; Forveille, T (Forveille, T.) ; Martins, JHC (Martins, J.

In the past 2 decades, a range of new therapeutic options have become available, leading to improvements in patient outcomes, including both attainment of remission and overall survival. These improved outcomes have heralded a paradigm shift from a palliative approach toward more active management, including the use of sequential therapies, with the goal of prolonging progression-free and overall survival and preserving organ function to enable delivery of further therapy at relapse. Until now, most outcome data for MM have come from clinical trials, with few reports available on patients treated outside the clinical trial setting-in the \"real world.\" Clinical trials are routinely undertaken in specialist centers, and extrapolation of these trial data to broader clinical practice might not accurately reflect \"real-world\" patient outcomes. Optimal management of MM is of key importance for positive patient outcomes, and further scrutiny of the efficacy and safety of the various reported therapies and how clinical trial findings are being translated or applied in the real-world management of MM is required. In the present review, we have described the minimal published evidence available through a comprehensive published data search of MEDLINE using the OvidSP interface on the management and outcomes of MM outside the setting of clinical trials, including evidence on the uptake of new therapies and their efficacy and tolerability in standard practice. Clinical registries might be able to help provide these data in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, drilling in Martian soil in search for organisms is the next logical step. Drilling on Mars is a major engineering challenge due to the drilling depth requirement and extreme environment condition. Mars lacks a thick atmosphere and a continuous magnetic field that shield the planet's surface from solar radiation and solar flares. As a result, the Martian surface is sterile and if life ever existed, it must be found below the surface. In 2001, NASA's Mars Exploration Payload Advisory Group proposed that drilling should be considered as a priority investigation on Mars in an effort of finding evidence of extinct or extant life. The results from the Curiosity mission suggested drilling six meters deep in the red planet in search for life. Excavation tools deployed to Mars so far have been able to drill to a maximum depth of 6.5 cm. Thus, the drilling capabilities need to be increased by a factor of approximately 100 to achieve the goal of drilling six meters deep. This requirement puts a demand on developing new and more effective technologies to reach this goal. Previous research shows evidence of a promising drilling mechanism in rotary-ultrasonic for what it offers in terms of high surface quality, faster rate of penetration and higher material removal rate. This research addresses the need to understand the mechanics of the drill bit tip and rock interface in rotary-ultrasonic drilling performance of one drill bit at a time drilling in three types of rocks that vary in strength. A mathematical model identifying all contributing independent parameters, such as drill bit design parameters, drilling process parameters, ultrasonic wave amplitude and rocks' material properties, that have effect on rate of penetration is developed. Analytical and experimental results under ambient condition are presented to show the effect of the variation of different parameters on rate of penetration performance as a first step of the investigation. It was found that the speed and WOB have significant effect on ROP while the rest of the parameter have very little or no effect.","Authors":"Horne, MF (Horne, Mera Fayez)","Title":"ROP MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF ROTARY-ULTRASONIC CORE DRILLING OF BRITTLE MATERIAL"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000394587000002 ISSN: 0022-0477 eISSN: 1365-2745","Keywords":"biodiversity; controlled vocabulary; ecology; informatics; ontology; plant characteristics; plant environmental association; plant trait; semantics; thesaurus KeyWords Plus:FUNCTIONAL TRAITS WORLDWIDE; DATA-INTENSIVE SCIENCE; ONTOLOGIES; DATABASE; HANDBOOK; FLORA; GENE; TOOL","Categories":"Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology Web of Science Categories:Plant Sciences; Ecology","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY Volume: 105 Issue: 2 Pages: 298-309 DOI: 10.1111/1365-2745.12698 Published: MAR 2017","Abstract":"Ecological research produces a tremendous amount of data, but the diversity in scales and topics covered and the ways in which studies are carried out result in large numbers of small, idiosyncratic data sets using heterogeneous terminologies.

It builds on previous initiatives for several aspects: (i) characteristics are designed following the entity-quality (EQ) model (a characteristic is modelled as the Quality' < Q > of an Entity' < E >) used in the context of Open Biological Ontologies; (ii) whenever possible, the Entities and Qualities are taken from existing terminology standards, mainly the Plant Ontology (PO) and Phenotypic Quality Ontology (PATO) ontologies; and (iii) whenever a characteristic already has a definition, if appropriate, it is reused and referenced. The development of TOP, which complies with semantic web principles, was carried out through the involvement of experts from both the ecology and the semantics research communities. Regular updates of TOP are planned, based on community feedback and involvement. TOP provides names, definitions, units, synonyms and related terms for about 850 plant characteristics. TOP is available online (www. top-thesaurus. org), and can be browsed using an alphabetical list of characteristics, a hierarchical tree of characteristics, a faceted and a free-text search, and through an Application Programming Interface. Synthesis. Harmonizing definitions of concepts, as proposed by TOP, forms the basis for better integration of data across heterogeneous data sets and terminologies, thereby increasing the potential for data reuse. It also allows enhanced scientific synthesis. TOP therefore has the potential to improve research and communication not only within the field of ecology, but also in related fields with interest in plant functioning and distribution.","Authors":"Garnier, E (Garnier, Eric) ; Stahl, U (Stahl, Ulrike) ; Laporte, MA (Laporte, Marie-Angelique) ; Kattge, J (Kattge, Jens) ; Mougenot, I (Mougenot, Isabelle) ; Kuhn, I (Kuehn, Ingolf) ; Laporte, B (Laporte, Baptiste); Amiaud, B (Amiaud, Bernard)[ 9,10 ] ; Ahrestani, FS (Ahrestani, Farshid S.)[ 11,12 ] ; Bonisch, G (Boenisch, Gerhard) ; Bunker, DE (Bunker, Daniel E.)[ 13 ] ; Cornelissen, JHC (Cornelissen, J.

Existing model of data organization and processing in Hadoop using HDFS and MapReduce are ideally tailored for search and data parallel applications, for which there is no need of data dependency with its neighboring/adjacent data. However, many scientific applications such as image mining, data mining, knowledge data mining, and satellite image processing are dependent on adjacent data for processing and analysis. In this paper, we identify the requirements of the overlapped data organization and propose a two-phase extension to HDFS and MapReduce programming model, called XHAMI, to address them. The extended interfaces are presented as APIs and implemented in the context of image processing application domain. We demonstrated effectiveness of XHAMI through case studies of image processing functions along with the results. Although XHAMI has little overhead in data storage and input/output operations, it greatly enhances the system performance and simplifies the application development process. Our proposed system, XHAMI, works without any changes for the existing MapReduce models and can be utilized by many applications where there is a requirement of overlapped data.

Both direct contacts and water-mediated interactions are crucial to the formation of a protein-protein complex. During the recent CAPRI rounds, a novel parallel searching strategy for predicting water-mediated interactions is introduced into our protein-protein docking method, MDockPP. Briefly, a FFT-based docking algorithm is employed in generating putative binding modes, and an iteratively derived statistical potential-based scoring function, ITScorePP, in conjunction with biological information is used to assess and rank the binding modes. Up to 10 binding modes are selected as the initial protein-protein complex structures for MD simulations in explicit solvent. Water molecules near the interface are clustered based on the snapshots extracted from independent equilibrated trajectories. Then, protein-ligand docking is employed for a parallel search for water molecules near the protein-protein interface. The water molecules generated by ligand docking and the clustered water molecules generated by MD simulations are merged, referred to as the predicted structural water molecules. Here, we report the performance of this protocol for CAPRI rounds 28-29 and 31-35 containing 20 valid docking targets and 11 scoring targets. In the docking experiments, we predicted correct binding modes for nine targets, including one high-accuracy, two medium-accuracy, and six acceptable predictions. Regarding the two targets for the prediction of water-mediated interactions, we achieved models ranked as \"excellent\" in accordance with the CAPRI evaluation criteria; one of these two targets is considered as a difficult target for structural water prediction.

Thus, reducing and scheduling energy usage is the key for any home energy management system (HEMS). To better match demand and supply, many utilities offer residential demand response program to change the pattern of power consumption of a residential customer by curtailing or shifting their energy use during the peak time period. In the present study, real time optimal schedule controller for HEMS is proposed using a new binary backtracking search algorithm (BBSA) to manage the energy consumption. The BBSA gives optimal schedule for home devices in order to limit the demand of total load and schedule the operation of home appliances at specific times during the day. Hardware prototype of smart sockets and graphical user interface software were designed to demonstrate the proposed HEMS and to provide the interface between loads and scheduler, respectively. A set of the Most common home appliances, namely, air conditioner, water heater, refrigerator, and washing machine has been considered to be controlled. The proposed scheduling algorithm is applied under two cases in which the first case considers operation at weekday from 4 to 11 pm and the second case considers weekend at different time of the day. Experimental results of the proposed BBSA schedule controller are compared with the binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) schedule controller to verify the accuracy of the developed controller in the HEMS. The BBSA schedule controller provides better results compared to that of the BPSO schedule controller in reducing the energy consumption and the total electricity bill and save the energy at peak hours of certain loads.

Within medicine and healthcare there has been slow progress towards major changes in safety. Healthcare lags behind other specialised industries, such as aviation and nuclear power, where there have been significant improvements in overall safety, especially in reducing risk of errors. Following several high profile cases in the USA during the 1990s, a report titled \"To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System\" was published. The report extrapolated that in the USA approximately 50,000 to 100,000 patients may die each year as a result of medical errors. Traditionally otolaryngology has always been regarded as a \"safe specialty\". A study in the USA in 2004 inferred that there may be 2600 cases of major morbidity and 165 deaths within the specialty. MEDLINE via PubMed interface was searched for English language articles published between 2000 and 2012. Each combined two or three of the keywords noted earlier. Limitations are related to several generic topics within patient safety in otolaryngology. Other areas covered have been current relevant topics due to recent interest or new advances in technology. There has been a heightened awareness within the healthcare community of patient safety; it has become a major priority. Focus has shifted from apportioning blame to prevention of the errors and implementation of patient safety mechanisms in healthcare delivery. Type of Errors can be divided into errors due to action and errors due to knowledge or planning. In healthcare there are several factors that may influence adverse events and patient safety. Although technology may improve patient safety, it also introduces new sources of error. The ability to work with people allows for the increase in safety netting. Team working has been shown to have a beneficial effect on patient safety. Any field of work involving human decision-making will always have a risk of error. Within Otolaryngology, although patient safety has evolved along similar themes as other surgical specialties; there are several specific high-risk areas. Medical error is a common problem and its human cost is of immense importance. Steps to reduce such errors require the identification of high-risk practice within a complex healthcare system. The commitment to patient safety and quality improvement in medicine depend on personal responsibility and professional accountability.","Authors":"Danino, J (Danino, Julian) ; Muzaffar, J (Muzaffar, Jameel) ; Metcalfe, C (Metcalfe, Chris) ; Coulson, C (Coulson, Chris)","Title":"Patient safety in otolaryngology: a descriptive review"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000393726500011 ISSN: 1746-8094 eISSN: 1746-8108","Keywords":"Brain computer interface; Signal processing; EEG signals; Classification; Channel selection; Feature extraction; Improved binary gravitation search algorithm KeyWords Plus:SENSORS","Categories":"Engineering; Medical Laboratory Technology Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Biomedical; Medical Laboratory Technology","Journal Information":"BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL Volume: 33 Pages: 109-118 DOI: 10.1016/j.bspc.2016.11.018 Published: MAR 2017","Abstract":"This paper presents an automatic method for finding optimal channels in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Detecting the effective channels in BCI systems is an important problem in reducing the complexity of these systems. In this research, Improved Binary Gravitation Search Algorithm (IBGSA) is used to automatically detect the effective electroencephalography (EEG) channels in left or right hand classification. To do this, at first, data is filtered with a bandpass filter in order to reduce the amount of different types of merged noise. Then, the electrooculography (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) artifacts are corrected based on Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithm. Data is epoched according to the left or right hand motor imageries and central beta frequency band is isolated for Event Related Synchronization (ERS) analysis. Feature extraction process is carried out by analyzing EEG signals in time and wavelet domains. The logarithmic power of each channel is computed in time domain and the features of mean, mode, median, variance, and standard deviation are calculated in wavelet domain. IBGSA is employed to detect the optimal channels to achieve better classification results. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as the classifier. The maximum accuracy of 80% and average accuracy of 76.24% were obtained for eight subjects in BCI competition IV dataset. The results of this research confirm that automatically detecting effective channels can enhance the practical implementation of BCI based systems and reduce the complexity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The modeling complexities lie in the tight coupling of the multiphase flow, heat transfer and multicomponent mass transfer, as well as diffusions across the phase interface. We present a sharp interface method for modeling such process. The non-ideal equation of state is used to compute the fluid properties such as density, fugacity and enthalpy, and to predict phase equilibrium composition. The phase interface location is tracked using the phase propagation velocity. A third-order one-sided finite difference scheme using a variable grid size according to the interface location is utilized to discretize the partial derivatives immediately next to the interface, while a second-order central scheme is used for the bulk of fluids. An optimization method, the Nelder-Mead method, is applied to search for (1) the phase compositions on both sides of the interface, and (2) the phase propagation velocity based on the coupling of the multicomponent phase equilibrium and the species' balance across the interface. The temperature at the interface is determined by the energy balance. Numerical results are used to demonstrate the convergence of our method and show its capability to simulate the mixing of multicomponent partially miscible fluids. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, data science methodology to enable the rapid searching/extraction, cleaning and analysis of these large, often complex, datasets is less well developed. In addition, commonly used software is inadequate, resulting in bottlenecks in research workflows and in obstacles to increased transparency and reproducibility of the research. Preparing a research-ready dataset from EHRs is a complex and time consuming task requiring substantial data science skills, even for simple designs. In addition, certain aspects of the workflow are computationally intensive, for example extraction of longitudinal data and matching controls to a large cohort, which may take days or even weeks to run using standard software. The rEHR package simplifies and accelerates the process of extracting ready-for-analysis datasets from EHR databases. It has a simple import function to a database backend that greatly accelerates data access times. A set of generic query functions allow users to extract data efficiently without needing detailed knowledge of SQL queries. Longitudinal data extractions can also be made in a single command, making use of parallel processing. The package also contains functions for cutting data by time-varying covariates, matching controls to cases, unit conversion and construction of clinical code lists. There are also functions to synthesise dummy EHR. The package has been tested with one for the largest primary care EHRs, the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), but allows for a common interface to other EHRs. This simplified and accelerated work flow for EHR data extraction results in simpler, cleaner scripts that are more easily debugged, shared and reproduced.","Authors":"Springate, DA (Springate, David A.) ; Parisi, R (Parisi, Rosa) ; Olier, I (Olier, Ivan) ; Reeves, D (Reeves, David) ; Kontopantelis, E (Kontopantelis, Evangelos)","Title":"rEHR: An R package for manipulating and analysing Electronic Health Record data"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000392678300011 ISSN: 0009-2509 eISSN: 1873-4405","Keywords":"Photosensitizer; Dental adhesive; QSPRs; Optimization; MINLP; Connectivity indices; Tabu Search KeyWords Plus:STRUCTURE-PROPERTY RELATIONSHIP; PHASE-SEPARATION; PHENOTHIAZINE DYES; CONTRACTION STRESS; REACTION-KINETICS; POLYMERIZATION; OPTIMIZATION; CONVERSION; COMPOSITES; INTERFACE","Categories":"Engineering Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Chemical","Journal Information":"CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE Volume: 159 Pages: 131-139 DOI: 10.1016/j.ces.2016.09.033 Published: FEB 23 2017","Abstract":"Dental adhesive resin undergoes phase separation during its infiltration through the wet demineralized dentin and it has been observed previously that the hydrophilic-rich phase is a vulnerable region for failure due to the lack of photo-polymerization and crosslinking density. The lack of photo-polymerization is mostly due to the partitioning of photo-initiators in low concentrations within this phase. Here, a computational approach has been employed to design candidate water compatible visible light photosensitizers which could improve the photo-polymerization of the hydrophilic-rich phase. This study is an extension of our previous work.

Here, we show that the enzyme reacts fast with H2O2 (k = 2.9 x 10(7) M-1 center dot s(-1)) and catalytically decomposes H2O2 using Cc as the reducing substrate with higher efficiency than Asc (k(cat)/K-m = 2.1 x 10(5) versus 3.5 x 10(4) M-1 center dot s(-1), respectively). Visible-absorption spectra of purified recombinant TcAPx-CcP after H2O2 reaction denote the formation of a compound I-like product, characteristic of the generation of a tryptophanyl radical-cation (Trp(233 center dot+)). Mutation of Trp(233) to phenylalanine (W233F) completely abolishes the Cc-dependent peroxidase activity. In addition to Trp(233 center dot+), a Cys(222)-derived radical was identified by electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping, immunospin trapping, and MS analysis after equimolar H2O2 addition, supporting an alternative electron transfer (ET) pathway from the heme. Molecular dynamics studies revealed that ET between Trp(233) and Cys(222) is possible and likely to participate in the catalytic cycle. Recognizing the ability of TcAPx-CcP to use alternative reducing substrates, we searched for its subcellular localization in the infective parasite stages (intracellular amastigotes and extracellular trypomastigotes). TcAPx-CcP was found closely associated with mitochondrial membranes and, most interestingly, with the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, suggesting a role at the host-parasite interface. TcAPx-CcP overexpressers were significantly more infective to macrophages and cardiomyocytes, as well as in the mouse model of Chagas disease, supporting the involvement of TcAPx-CcP in pathogen virulence as part of the parasite antioxidant armamentarium.","Authors":"Hugo, M (Hugo, Martin) ; Martinez, A (Martinez, Alejandra) ; Trujillo, M (Trujillo, Madia) ; Estrada, D (Estrada, Damian) ; Mastrogiovanni, M (Mastrogiovanni, Mauricio) ; Linares, E (Linares, Edlaine) ; Augusto, O (Augusto, Ohara) ; Issoglio, F (Issoglio, Federico) ; Zeida, A (Zeida, Ari) ; Estrin, DA (Estrin, Dario A.) ; Heijnen, HFG (Heijnen, Harry F.

PPI data can help biochemists hypothesize how proteins form complexes by binding to each other, how extracellular signals propagate through post-translational modification of de-activated signaling molecules, and how chemical reactions are coupled by enzymes involved in a complex biological process. Our capability to develop good public database resources for human PPI data has a direct impact on the quality of future research on genome biology and medicine. Results: The database of Human Annotated and Predicted Protein Interactions (HAPPI) version 2.0 is a major update to the original HAPPI 1.0 database. It contains 2,922,202 unique protein-protein interactions (PPI) linked by 23,060 human proteins, making it the most comprehensive database covering human PPI data today. These PPIs contain both physical/direct interactions and high-quality functional/indirect interactions. Compared with the HAPPI 1.0 database release, HAPPI database version 2.0 (HAPPI-2) represents a 485% of human PPI data coverage increase and a 73% protein coverage increase. The revamped HAPPI web portal provides users with a friendly search, curation, and data retrieval interface, allowing them to retrieve human PPIs and available annotation information on the interaction type, interaction quality, interacting partner drug targeting data, and disease information. The updated HAPPI-2 can be freely accessed by Academic users at http://discovery.informatics.uab.edu/HAPPI. Conclusions: While the underlying data for HAPPI-2 are integrated from a diverse data sources, the new HAPPI-2 release represents a good balance between data coverage and data quality of human PPIs, making it ideally suited for network biology.","Authors":"Chen, JY (Chen, Jake Y.) ; Pandey, R (Pandey, Ragini) ; Nguyen, TM (Nguyen, Thanh M.)","Title":"HAPPI-2: a Comprehensive and High-quality Map of Human Annotated and Predicted Protein Interactions"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article; Proceedings Paper Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397748100054 ISSN: 0733-8724 eISSN: 1558-2213","Keywords":"Bit-interleaved coded modulation; coherent optical communication; convolutional codes; differential encoding; forward error correction; multilevel coding; quadrature amplitude modulation; rotationally invariant coding KeyWords Plus:DESIGN; SYSTEMS; CODES","Categories":"Engineering; Optics; Telecommunications Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Optics; Telecommunications","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY Volume: 35 Issue: 4 Pages: 1006-1014 DOI: 10.1109/JLT.2016.2625047 Published: FEB 15 2017","Abstract":"For a cost efficient, high capacity, coherent dense wavelength division multiplex transmission in data center interconnect applications, the number of optical interfaces should be minimized, the throughput of each modulated channel should be maximized, and the system density should be increased. These goals are supported by using high baud rates, spectrally efficient modulation, and low-power solutions. Allowing independent design of non-binary modulation and binary forward error correction (FEC) coding, bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) eases the system design for software-defined reach (or capacity) by combining a programmable modulation with a single binary FEC code. Unfortunately, as we demonstrate, the suboptimality of BICM implementations tends to increase both with the higher modulation order and also the higher FEC overhead. This motivates a search for alternatives to BICM. In this paper, we examine a low-power multilevel coding architecture for higher order quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM). Limiting ourselves to non-iterative low-power solutions, we show that two-level coding using a low-complexity convolutional code concatenated with a powerful hard decoded FEC may be an attractive approach. We demonstrate a pilot-free, phase-slip tolerant inner coding scheme with low complexity, attractive performance, and low latency. In a real-time prototype, we study the performance and implementation aspects for 64 QAM, resulting in 12.9 dB net coding gain with less than 1 Wpower dissipation per coded 100 G in 14 nm ASIC technology.","Authors":"Bisplinghoff, A (Bisplinghoff, Andreas) ; Langenbach, S (Langenbach, Stefan) ; Kupfer, T (Kupfer, Theodor)","Title":"Low-Power, Phase-Slip Tolerant, Multilevel Coding for M-QAM"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000394398800006 ISSN: 2210-271X eISSN: 1872-7999","Keywords":"Hydroyxlated silica; Nanoclusters; Global optimisation KeyWords Plus:MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; AMORPHOUS SILICA; NANO-SILICA; NANOPARTICLES; SURFACES; ENERGY; OLIGOMERIZATION; SIMULATIONS; INTERFACE; CHEMISTRY","Categories":"Chemistry Web of Science Categories:Chemistry, Physical","Journal Information":"COMPUTATIONAL AND THEORETICAL CHEMISTRY Volume: 1102 Pages: 38-43 DOI: 10.1016/j.comptc.2016.12.030 Published: FEB 15 2017","Abstract":"We report on a global optimisation study of hydroxylated silica nanoclusters (SiO2)/w(H2O)(N) with sizes M = 6, 8, 10 12, and for each size with a variable number of dissociatively chemisorbed water molecules (N = 1, 2, 3...). Due to the high structural complexity of these systems and the associated ruggedness of the underlying potential energy landscape, we employ a \"cascade\" global optimisation approach. Specifically, we use Monte Carlo Basin Hopping (MCBH) where for each step we employ two energy minimisations with: (i) a lightly parameterised but computationally efficient interatomic potential (IP) which does not distinguish between H-bonded conformational isomers, and then (ii) a more sophisticated IP which accounts for polarisation and H-bonding. Final energies from the MCBH search are then refined with optimisations using density functional theory. The reliability of our approach is first established via comparison with previously reported results for the (SiO2)(8).(H2O)(N) case, and then applied to the M = 6, 10 and 12 systems. For all systems studied our results follow the trend in hydroxylation energy versus N, whereby the energy gain with hydroxylation is found to level off at a point where the average tetrahedral distortion of the SiO4 centres is minimised. This optimal hydroxylation point is further found to follow an inverse power law with increasing cluster size (M) with an exponent close to -2/3, further confirming work in previous studies for other cluster sizes.

To accomplish this, a test-analysis component mode synthesis (CMS) model with fixed-free component boundaries is implemented to directly compare measured frequency response functions (FRFs) from vibration experiments of individual modules. The experimental boundary conditions are made to emulate module connection interfaces and can enable individual joint and link modules to be tested in arbitrary poses. By doing so, changes in the joint dynamics can be observed and more FRF data points can be obtained from experiments to be used in the updating process. Because this process yields an over determined system of equations, a direct search method with nonlinear constraints on the resonances and antiresonances is used to update the FRFs of the analytical component models. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with experimental case studies on an adjustable modular linkage system. Overall, the method can enable virtual testing of modular robot systems without the need to perform further testing on entire assemblies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The first step towards the molecular characterisation of PPIs implies the charting of their interfaces, that is, the surfaces mediating the interaction. To this end, we present here iFrag, a sequence-based computational method that infers possible interacting regions between two proteins by searching minimal common sequence fragments of the interacting protein pairs. By utilising the sequences of two interacting proteins (queries), iFrag derives a two-dimensional matrix computing a score for each pair of residues that relates to the presence of similar regions in interolog protein pairs. The scoring matrix is represented as a heat map reflecting the potential interface regions in both query proteins. Unlike existing approaches, iFrag does not require three-dimensional structural information or multiple sequence alignments and can even predict small interaction sites consisting only of few residues. Thus, predicted interfaces range from short fragments composed of few residues to domains of proteins, depending on available information on PPIs, as we demonstrate in several examples. Moreover, as a proof of concept, we include the experimental validation on the successful prediction of a peptide competing with the aggregation of p-amyloid in Alzheimer's disease. iFrag is freely accessible at http://sbi.imim.es/iFrag.

Structural levels in the hierarchy range from alpha-carbon or phosphate backbones through secondary structure to domains, molecules, and multimers with each level represented in an identical data structure that can be manipulated using the application programming interface. Unlike most coarse-grained simulation approaches, the higher-level objects represented in SimGen can be soft, allowing the lower-level objects that they contain to interact directly. The default motion simulated by SimGen is a Brownian-like diffusion that can be set to occur across all levels of representation in the hierarchy. Links can also be defined between objects, which, when combined with large high-level random movements, result in an effective search strategy for constraint satisfaction, including structure prediction from predicted pairwise distances. The implementation of SimGen makes use of the hierarchic data structure to avoid unnecessary calculation, especially for collision detection, allowing it to be simultaneously run and viewed on a laptop computer while simulating large systems of over 20,000 objects. It has been used previously to model complex molecular interactions including the motion of a myosin-V dimer \"walking\" on an actin fibre, RNA stem-loop packing, and the simulation of cell motion and aggregation.

However, given its computational complexity, only recent breakthroughs on pattern-based biclustering enabled efficient searches without the restrictions that state-of-the-art biclustering algorithms place on the structure and homogeneity of biclusters. As a result, pattern-based biclustering provides the unprecedented opportunity to discover non-trivial yet meaningful biological modules with putative functions, whose coherency and tolerance to noise can be tuned and made problem-specific. Methods: To enable the effective use of pattern-based biclustering by the scientific community, we developed BicPAMS (Biclustering based on PAttern Mining Software), a software that: 1) makes available state-of-the-art pattern-based biclustering algorithms (BicPAM (Henriques and Madeira, Alg Mol Biol 9: 27, 2014), BicNET (Henriques and Madeira, Alg Mol Biol 11: 23, 2016), BicSPAM (Henriques and Madeira, BMC Bioinforma 15: 130, 2014), BiC2PAM (Henriques and Madeira, Alg Mol Biol 11: 1-30, 2016), BiP (Henriques and Madeira, IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinforma, 2015), DeBi (Serin and Vingron, AMB 6:1-12, 2011) and BiModule (Okada et al., IPSJ Trans Bioinf 48(SIG5):39-48, 2007)); 2) consistently integrates their dispersed contributions; 3) further explores additional accuracy and efficiency gains; and 4) makes available graphical and application programming interfaces. Results: Results on both synthetic and real data confirm the relevance of BicPAMS for biological data analysis, highlighting its essential role for the discovery of putative modules with non-trivial yet biologically significant functions from expression and network data. Conclusions: BicPAMS is the first biclustering tool offering the possibility to: 1) parametrically customize the structure, coherency and quality of biclusters; 2) analyze large-scale biological networks; and 3) tackle the restrictive assumptions placed by state-of-the-art biclustering algorithms.

Hampered by a variety of cognitive and institutional biases, the conventional disaster risk management planning based on the \"known risks\" led to the cascading failures of the interlinked disaster risk management (DRM)apparatus. This realization led to a major rethinking in the use of science for policy and the incorporations of lessons learned in the country's new DRM policy. This study reviews publicly available documents on expert committee discussions and scientific articles to identify what continuities and changes have been made in the use of scientific knowledge in Japanese risk management. In general, the prior influence of cognitive bias (e.g., overreliance on documented hazard risks) has been largely recognized, and increased attention is now being paid to the incorporation of less documented but known risks. This has led to upward adjustments in estimated damages from future risks and recognition of the need for further strengthening of DRM policy. At the same time, there remains significant continuity in the way scientific knowledge is perceived to provide sufficient and justifiable grounds for the development and implementation of DRM policy. The emphasis on \"evidence-based policy\" in earthquake and tsunami risk reduction measures continues, despite the critical reflections of a group of scientists who advocate for a major rethinking of the country's science-policy institution respecting the limitations of the current state science.","Authors":"Mochizuki, J (Mochizuki, Junko) ; Komendantova, N (Komendantova, Nadejda)","Title":"In Search of Perfect Foresight?

In many fields (e.g., software engineering, web engineering, interface design) patterns are widely used by practitioners and are also investigated from a research perspective. Still, they have been seldom explored in the arena of Recommender Systems (RSs). RSs provide suggestions (\"recommendations\") for items that are likely to be appropriate for the user profile, and are increasingly adopted in content-intensive multimedia applications to complement traditional forms of search in large information spaces. This paper explores RSs through the lens of User Interface (UI) Design Patterns. We have performed a systematic analysis of 54 recommendation-empowered content-intensive multimedia applications, in order to: (i) discover the occurrences of existing domain independent UI patterns; (ii) identify frequently adopted UI solutions that are not modelled by existing patterns, and define a set of new UI patterns, some of which are specific of the interfaces for recommendation features while others can be useful also in a broader context. The results of our inspection have been discussed with and evaluated by a team of experts, leading to a consolidated set of 14 new patterns that are reported in the paper. Reusing pattern-based design solutions instead of building new solutions from scratch enables novice and expert designers to build good UIs for Recommendation-empowered content intensive multimedia applications more effectively, and ultimately can improve the UX experience in this class of systems. From a broader perspective, our work can stimulate future research bridging Recommender Systems, Web Engineering and Interface Design by means of Design Patterns, and highlights new research directions also discussed in the paper.","Authors":"Cremonesi, P (Cremonesi, Paolo) ; Elahi, M (Elahi, Mehdi) ; Garzotto, F (Garzotto, Franca)","Title":"User interface patterns in recommendation-empowered content intensive multimedia applications"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000394868900001 ISSN: 1687-8140","Keywords":"Path planning; boundary sequence permutation method; turning point detection method; Dijkstra's algorithm; obstacle avoidance KeyWords Plus:DIGITAL CURVES; ANGLE DETECTION; MOBILE ROBOT","Categories":"Thermodynamics; Engineering Web of Science Categories:Thermodynamics; Engineering, Mechanical","Journal Information":"ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING Volume: 9 Issue: 2 Article Number: 1687814016683353 DOI: 10.1177/1687814016683353 Published: FEB 1 2017","Abstract":"In this study, image processing was combined with path-planning object-avoidance technology to determine the shortest path to the destination.

Then, turning point detection method was used to compare the angle size between vectors before and after each edge point and to determine vertex coordinates of polygonal obstacles. In the second part, a modified Dijkstra's algorithm was used to turn vertices of convex-shaped obstacles into network nodes, to determine the shortest path by a cost function, and to find an obstacle avoidance path connecting the start and end points. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed architecture, an obstacle avoidance path simulation was made by the graphical user interface of the programming language MATLAB.

For docking of these commonly large and flexible compounds to be addressed, a screening and a validation set were assembled from the PDB consisting of 16 and 31 macrocycle-containing protein complexes, respectively. The macrocydes were docked in Glide by rigid docking of pregenerated conformational ensembles produced by the macrocycle conformational sampling method (MCS) in Schrodinger Release 2015-3 or by direct Glide flexible docking after performing ring-templating. The two protocols were compared to rigid docking of pregenerated conformational ensembles produced by an exhaustive Monte Carlo multiple minimum (MCMM) conformational search and a shorter MCMM conformational search (MCMM-short). The docking accuracy was evaluated and expressed as the RMSD between the heavy atoms of the ligand as found in the X-ray structure after refinement and the poses obtained by the docking protocols. The median RMSD values for top-scored poses of the screening set were 0.83, 0.80, 0.88, and 0.58 angstrom for MCMM, MCMM-short, MCS, and Glide flexible docking, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the performance between rigid docking of pregenerated conformations produced by the MCS and direct docking using Glide flexible docking. However, the flexible docking protocol was 2-times faster in docking the screening set compared to that of the MCS protocol. In a final study, the new Prime-MCS method was evaluated in Schrodinger Release 2016-3. This method is faster compared that of to MCS; however, the conformations generated were found to be suboptimal for rigid docking: Therefore, on the basis of timing, accuracy, and ease of set up, standard Glide flexible docking with prior ring-templating is recommended over current gold standard protocols using rigid docking of pregenerated conformational ensembles.","Authors":"Alogheli, H (Alogheli, Hiba) ; Olanders, G (Olanders, Gustav) ; Schaal, W (Schaal, Wesley) ; Brandt, P (Brandt, Peter) ; Karlen, A (Karlen, Anders) Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number Brandt, Peter  A-5805-2015 http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2885-2016","Title":"Docking of Macrocycles: Comparing Rigid and Flexible Docking in Glide"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Review Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395053000001 PubMed ID: 28286462 ISSN: 1609-0985 eISSN: 2199-4757","Keywords":"Below-knee; Prostheses; Misalignment; Normal stress; Pressure distribution KeyWords Plus:BRAGG GRATING SENSORS; LONG-DISTANCE WALKING; TRANS-TIBIAL STUMP; SHEAR STRESSES; RESIDUAL LIMB; STUMP/SOCKET INTERFACE; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; SKIN PROBLEMS; AMPUTEES; GAIT","Categories":"Engineering Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Biomedical","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING Volume: 37 Issue: 1 Pages: 1-17 DOI: 10.1007/s40846-017-0217-5 Published: FEB 2017","Abstract":"Suitable lower-limb prosthetic sockets must provide an adequate distribution of the pressures created from standing and ambulation.

Each study used a design where participants acted as their own controls. Results were available for 52 individuals and five forms of alignment perturbation. Four studies were rated as having moderate internal and external validity, the remainder were considered to have low validity. Significant limitations in study design, reporting quality and in representation of results and the suitability of calculations of statistical significance were evident across articles. Despite the high inhomogeneity of study designs, moderate evidence supports repeatable changes in pressure distribution for specific induced changes in component alignment. However, there also appears to be a significant individual component to alignment responses.

Literature is difficult to interpret and use given the variety of interventions, outcome measures and method designs. Critical appraisal and synthesis of the evidence is needed to help inform decisions about liner prescription based on the user experience. Objectives: To critically appraise and synthesise research describing the user experience of transtibial prosthetic liners. Study design: Systematic review. Methods: A comprehensive suite of databases were searched using terms related to amputation level, liner type and user experience. Included studies were in English and measured the first-person experience of using a transtibial liner. Studies were appraised using the McMaster University Critical Review Forms. Results: A total of 18 articles met the inclusion criteria. While the quality of the evidence has improved over time, a number of common issues (e.g. sampling bias, validity of outcome measures, incorrect inferential analysis) reduce our ability to differentiate between the user experience of different transtibial liners. Conclusion: There is insufficient research to differentiate between the user experience of different transtibial liners. High-quality research is needed to inform decisions about liner prescription based on the user experience. Clinical relevance The available evidence suggests that the user experience of commonly reported problems (e.g. sweating) may be very similar between different liners. Aspects of the user experience that differ most between liners (e.g. unwanted noises, rotation within the socket) can help focus attention on what matters most when discussing prescription.","Authors":"Richardson, A (Richardson, Amy) ; Dillon, MP (Dillon, Michael P.)","Title":"User experience of transtibial prosthetic liners: A systematic review"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397260800027 PubMed ID: 28158465 ISSN: 1367-4803 eISSN: 1460-2059","Categories":"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Computer Science; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Mathematics Web of Science Categories:Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Statistics & Probability","Journal Information":"BIOINFORMATICS Volume: 33 Issue: 3 Pages: 461-463 DOI: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btw626 Published: FEB 1 2017","Abstract":"We present a Cytoscape app for the ISMAGS algorithm, which can enumerate all instances of a motif in a graph, making optimal use of the motif's symmetries to make the search more efficient.

The development of INTAKE24 was a four-stage iterative process of user interaction and evaluation with the intended end users, 11-24 years old. A total of 80 11-24 years old took part in the evaluation, 20 at each stage.

Improvements to the text entry, search functionality, and navigation around the system were also influenced through feedback from users at each stage.

Evidence that hydroxyapatite, in granular form, maintains volume in the long term supports its use in the correction of aging, in addition to its use in the correction of inherently deficient areas of the facial skeleton. The biologic response of hydroxyapatite needs to be fully understood for its use to be confidently recommended. Samples of 'living' hydroxyapatite from the anterior maxilla, zygoma, and mandible of 17 patients were analyzed. These were obtained during revision procedures performed between 6 months and 15 years following original placement on the facial skeleton. Histology showed that in every case, the individual granules were embedded within a mass of collagen that made up about half of the total implant volume. The collagen mass also contained fine elastin, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, occasional granulomas, and vessels. By 2 years, a new compact bone containing osteoblasts and osteocytes was present in all specimens in the deep (osseous) aspect. Bone progressively replaced the original collagen between the granules with a sharply defined transition at the interface. This study confirmed a two-stage biologic change following onlay placement of hydroxyapatite granules on the facial skeleton, i.e., initial collagen formation with subsequent conversion to bone. This integrates the implant with the host bone which stabilizes the implant position and shape initially and in long term.

To this end, we carried out a longitudinal analysis (1950-2013), running a generic query (filtered only by year of publication) to minimise the effects of academic search engine optimisation. This gave us a final sample of 64,000 documents (1000 per year). The strong correlation between a document's citations and its position in the search results (r = 0.67) led us to conclude that Google Scholar is able to identify highly-cited papers effectively. This, combined with Google Scholar's unique coverage (no restrictions on document type and source), makes the academic search engine an invaluable tool for bibliometric research relating to the identification of the most influential scientific documents. We find evidence, however, that Google Scholar ranks those documents whose language (or geographical web domain) matches with the user's interface language higher than could be expected based on citations. Nonetheless, this language effect and other factors related to the Google Scholar's operation, i.e. the proper identification of versions and the date of publication, only have an incidental impact.

This device utilizes immunomagnetic positive selection of antibody-bound cells, isolation of cells through an immiscible interface, and filtration. The isolated cells can then be stained utilizing immunofluorescence or used for other downstream detection methods. We describe the construction and initial preclinical testing of the device. Initial tests suggest that the device may be well suited for the isolation of CTCs and could allow the monitoring of cancer progression and the response to therapy over time.","Authors":"van der Toom, EE (van der Toom, Emma E.) ; Verdone, JE (Verdone, James E.) ; Jun, CH (Jun, Changhan) ; Petrisor, D (Petrisor, Doru) ; Lim, S (Lim, Sunghwan) ; de la Rosette, JJMCH (de la Rosette, Jean J.

We further discuss the drawbacks of current solutions and underline promising technologies for future development. A systematic literature search of scientific papers that deal with touchless control of medical software in the immediate environment of the operation room and interventional radiology suite was performed. This includes methods for touchless gesture interaction, voice control and eye tracking. Fifty-five research papers were identified and analyzed in detail including 33 journal publications. Most of the identified literature (62 %) deals with the control of medical image viewers. The others present interaction techniques for laparoscopic assistance (13 %), telerobotic assistance and operating room control (9 % each) as well as for robotic operating room assistance and intraoperative registration (3.5 % each). Only 8 systems (14.5 %) were tested in a real clinical environment, and 7 (12.7 %) were not evaluated at all. In the last 10 years, many advancements have led to robust touchless interaction approaches. However, only a few have been systematically evaluated in real operating room settings. Further research is required to cope with current limitations of touchless software interfaces in clinical environments. The main challenges for future research are the improvement and evaluation of usability and intuitiveness of touchless human-computer interaction and the full integration into productive systems as well as the reduction of necessary interaction steps and further development of hands-free interaction.","Authors":"Mewes, A (Mewes, Andre) ; Hensen, B (Hensen, Bennet) ; Wacker, F (Wacker, Frank) ; Hansen, C (Hansen, Christian) Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number Hansen, Christian  http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5734-7529","Title":"Touchless interaction with software in interventional radiology and surgery: a systematic literature review"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000393642400024 PubMed ID: 27722824 ISSN: 0341-2695 eISSN: 1432-5195","Keywords":"Intramedullary fixation; Extramedullary fixation; Unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures; Meta-analysis; Randomized controlled trials KeyWords Plus:SLIDING HIP SCREW; LONG GAMMA-NAIL; TROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; ANTIROTATION; FEMUR","Categories":"Orthopedics Web of Science Categories:Orthopedics","Journal Information":"INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS Volume: 41 Issue: 2 Pages: 403-413 DOI: 10.1007/s00264-016-3308-y Published: FEB 2017","Abstract":"Purpose Intramedullary and extramedullary fixation methods are widely used to treat unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures, but the optimal surgical method remains controversial. The aim of this study was to estimate the outcomes of intramedullary fixation versus extramedullary fixation in treating unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures. Methods Electronic literature databases were used for searching including MEDLINE (Ovid interface), EMBASE (Ovid interface) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Wiley Online Library) (up to March 30, 2016). Only human studies, which were designed as randomized controlled clinical trials, were included. Two authors independently evaluated the quality of original literature and extracted data from eligible literature. Results Eleven randomized controlled trials involving 1,543 patients were included. Intramedullary fixation was significantly better in functional scores (SMD 0.43, 95 % CI 0.14-0.73, P = 0.004) and had less blood loss (SMD -0.96, 95 % CI -1.77 to -0.11, P = 0.03) in contrast with extramedullary fixation. No obvious discrepancies were found in adverse events, operative time, blood transfusion, and hospital stay between intramedullary and extramedullary fixations. Conclusion Our meta-analysis of 11 prospective randomized controlled trials suggested: no obvious discrepancies were found in adverse events, operative time, blood transfusion, and hospital stay between intramedullary and extramedullary fixations. Given the better results of intramedullary fixation in terms of functional scores and blood loss, we recommend the intramedullary fixation technique in treating unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures. Large multi-center RCTs, which focused on unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures, are needed to evaluate the efficiency of alternative internal fixation strategies in the future.","Authors":"Li, AB (Li, A-Bing) ; Zhang, WJ (Zhang, Wei-Jiang) ; Wang, J (Wang, Jie) ; Guo, WJ (Guo, Wei-Jun) ; Wang, XH (Wang, Xin-Hua) ; Zhao, YM (Zhao, You-Ming)","Title":"Intramedullary and extramedullary fixations for the treatment of unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures: a meta-analysis of prospective randomized controlled trials"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000393689700006 PubMed ID: 27561754 ISSN: 0897-1889 eISSN: 1618-727X","Keywords":"Content-based image retrieval; Computer systems; Graphical user interface (GUI); Information storage and retrieval; PACS; Reproducibility of results; Software design; Multimodal information retrieval; Query fusion; Web services KeyWords Plus:RETRIEVAL; FUSION","Categories":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging Web of Science Categories:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING Volume: 30 Issue: 1 Pages: 39-48 DOI: 10.1007/s10278-016-9903-z Published: FEB 2017","Abstract":"The use of digital medical imaging systems in healthcare institutions has increased significantly, and the large amounts of data in these systems have led to the conception of powerful support tools: recent studies on content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and multimodal information retrieval in the field hold great potential in decision support, as well as for addressing multiple challenges in healthcare systems, such as computer-aided diagnosis (CAD).

However, there has yet to be a review of this emerging technology used by MSTs in low-resource settings. The aim of this study is to describe EMR systems designed specifically for use by mobile MSTs in remote settings, and accordingly, determine new opportunities for this technology to improve quality of healthcare provided by MSTs. Methods: A MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus/IEEE search and supplementary Google search were performed for EMR systems specific to mobile MSTs. Information was extracted regarding EMR name, organization, scope of use, platform, open source coding, commercial availability, data integration, and capacity for linguistic and decision support. Missing information was requested by email. Results: After screening of 122 abstracts, two articles remained that discussed deployment of EMR systems in MST settings (iChart, SmartList To Go), and thirteen additional EMR systems were found through the Google search. Of these, three systems (Project Buendia, TEBOW, and University of Central Florida's internally developed EMR) are based on modified versions of Open MRS software, while three are smartphone apps (QuickChart EMR, iChart, NotesFirst). Most of the systems use a local network to manage data, while the remaining systems use opportunistic cloud synchronization. Three (TimmyCare, Basil, and Backpack EMR) contain multilingual user interfaces, and only one (QuickChart EMR) contained MST-specific clinical decision support. Discussion: There have been limited attempts to tailor EMRs to mobile MSTs. Only Open MRS has a broad user base, and other EMR systems should consider interoperability and data sharing with larger systems as a priority. Several systems include tablet compatibility, or are specifically designed for smartphone, which may be helpful given the environment and low resource context. Results from this review may be useful to non-government organizations (NGOs) considering modernization of their medical records practices as EMR use facilitates research, decreases paper administration costs, and improves perceptions of professionalism; however, most MST-specific EMRs remain in their early stages, and further development and research is required before reaching the stage of widespread adoption.

EEG can be used for various applications, such as diagnosis of diseases, neuroscience and Brain Computer Interface (BCI). Several artefacts sources can disturb the brain signals in EEG measurements. The signals caused by eye movements are the most important sources of artefacts that must be removed in order to obtain a clean EEG signal. During the removal of Ocular Artefacts (OAs), the preserve of the original EEG signal is one of the most important points to be taken into account. An ElectroOculoGram (EOG) reference signal is needed in order to remove OAs in some methods. However, long-term EOG measurements can disturb a subject. In this paper, a novel robust method is proposed in order to remove OAs automatically from EEG without EOG reference signal by combining Outlier Detection and Independent Component Analysis (OD-ICA). The OD-ICA method searches OA patterns in all components instead of a single component. Moreover, OD-ICA removes only OA patterns and preserves meaningful EEG signal. In this method, user intervention is not needed. These advantages make the method robust. The OD-ICA is tested on two real datasets. Relative Error (RE), Correlation Coefficient (CorrCoeff) and percentage of finding OA pattern are used for the performance test. Furthermore, three different methods are used as Outlier Detection (OD) methods. These are the Chauvenet Criterion, the Peirce's Criterion and the Adjusted Box Plot. The performance analysis is made between our proposed method and the method of zeroing the component with artefact. The experiment results show that the proposed OD-ICA method effectively removes OAs from EEG signals and is also successful in preserving the meaningful EEG signals during the removal of OAs.

In this article, we introduce a basic mechanism for the control of heuristic search through fNIRS-based BCI. The rationale is that heuristic search is not only a basic Al mechanism but also one still at the heart of many different Al systems. We investigate how users' mental disposition can be harnessed to influence the performance of heuristic search algorithm through a mechanism of precision-complexity exchange. From a system perspective, we use weighted variants of the A-algorithm which have an ability to provide faster, albeit suboptimal solutions. We use recent results in affective BCI to capture a BCI signal, which is indicative of a compatible mental disposition in the user. It has been established that Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) asymmetry is strongly correlated to motivational dispositions and results anticipation, such as approach or even risk-taking, and that this asymmetry is amenable to Neurofeedback (NF) control. Since PFC asymmetry is accessible through fNIRS, we designed a BCI paradigm in which users vary their PFC asymmetry through NF during heuristic search tasks, resulting in faster solutions. This is achieved through mapping the PFC asymmetry value onto the dynamic weighting parameter of the weighted A*(WA*) algorithm. We illustrate this approach through two different experiments, one based on solving 8-puzzle configurations, and the other on path planning. In both experiments, subjects were able to speed up the computation of a solution through a reduction of search space in WA* Our results establish the ability of subjects to intervene in heuristic search progression, with effects which are commensurate to their control of PFC asymmetry: this opens the way to new mechanisms for the implementation of hybrid cognitive systems.","Authors":"Cavazza, M (Cavazza, Marc) ; Aranyi, G (Aranyi, Gabor) ; Charles, F (Charles, Fred)","Title":"BCI Control of Heuristic Search Algorithms"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000393339800014 PubMed ID: 27932461 ISSN: 0021-9258 eISSN: 1083-351X","Categories":"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology Web of Science Categories:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY Volume: 292 Issue: 4 Pages: 1310-1329 DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M116.748822 Published: JAN 27 2017","Abstract":"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv genome encodes 20 cytochromes P450, including P450s crucial to infection and bacterial viability. Many M. tuberculosis P450s remain uncharacterized, suggesting that their further analysis may provide new insights into M. tuberculosis metabolic processes and new targets for drug discovery. CYP126A1 is representative of a P450 family widely distributed in mycobacteria and other bacteria. Here we explore the biochemical and structural properties of CYP126A1, including its interactions with new chemical ligands. A survey of azole antifungal drugs showed that CYP126A1 is inhibited strongly by azoles containing an imidazole ring but not by those tested containing a triazole ring. To further explore the molecular preferences of CYP126A1 and search for probes of enzyme function, we conducted a high throughput screen. Compounds containing three or more ring structures dominated the screening hits, including nitroaromatic compounds that induce substrate-like shifts in the heme spectrum of CYP126A1. Spectroelectrochemical measurements revealed a 155-mV increase in heme iron potential when bound to one of the newly identified nitroaromatic drugs. CYP126A1 dimers were observed in crystal structures of ligand-free CYP126A1 and for CYP126A1 bound to compounds discovered in the screen. However, ketoconazole binds in an orientation that disrupts the BC-loop regions at the P450 dimer interface and results in a CYP126A1 monomeric crystal form. Structural data also reveal that nitroaromatic ligands \"moonlight\" as substrates by displacing the CYP126A1 distal water but inhibit enzyme activity. The relatively polar active site of CYP126A1 distinguishes it from its most closely related sterol-binding P450s in M. tuberculosis, suggesting that further investigations will reveal its diverse substrate selectivity.","Authors":"Chenge, JT (Chenge, Jude T.) ; Duyet, LV (Le Van Duyet) ; Swami, S (Swami, Shalini) ; McLean, KJ (McLean, Kirsty J.) ; Kavanagh, ME (Kavanagh, Madeline E.) ; Coyne, AG (Coyne, Anthony G.) ; Rigby, SEJ (Rigby, Stephen E.

In the past, a typical basic research laboratory would focus on only a few plant lines that were carefully isolated from collections of lines containing random mutations. The subsequent technological breakthrough in high-throughput sequencing, combined with novel and highly efficient mutagenesis techniques (including site-directed mutagenesis), has led to a recent exponential growth in plant line collections used by individual researchers. Tracking the generation and genetic properties of these genetic resources is thus becoming increasingly challenging for researchers. Another difficulty for researchers is controlling the use of seeds protected by a Material Transfer Agreement, as often only the original recipient of the seeds is aware of the existence of such documents. This situation can thus lead to difficult legal situations. Simultaneously, various institutions and the general public now demand more information about the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In response, researchers are seeking new database solutions to address the triple challenge of research competition, legal constraints, and institutional/public demands. To help plant biology laboratories organize, describe, store, trace, and distribute their seeds, we have developed the new program SeedUSoon, with simplicity in mind. This software contains data management functions that allow the separate tracking of distinct mutations, even in successive crossings or mutagenesis. SeedUSoon reflects the biotechnological diversity of mutations and transgenes contained in any specific line, and the history of their inheritance. It can facilitate GMO certification procedures by distinguishing mutations on the basis of the presence/absence of a transgene, and by recording the technology used for their generation. Its interface can be customized to match the context and rules of any laboratory. In addition, SeedUSoon includes functions to help the laboratory protect intellectual property, export data, and facilitate seed exchange between laboratories. The SeedUSoon program, which is customizable to match individual practices and preferences, provides a powerful toolkit to plant laboratories searching for innovative approaches in laboratory management.","Authors":"Charavay, C (Charavay, Celine) ; Segard, S (Segard, Stephane) ; Pochon, N (Pochon, Nathalie) ; Nussaume, L (Nussaume, Laurent) ; Javot, H (Javot, Helene)","Title":"SeedUSoon: A New Software Program to Improve Seed Stock Management and Plant Line Exchanges between Research Laboratories"}]
