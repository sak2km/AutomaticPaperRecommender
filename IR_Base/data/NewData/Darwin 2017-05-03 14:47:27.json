The unremitting ' trembling of the eye ' that occurs even during gaze fixation was first noted by Jurin in 1738. In 1794, Erasmus Darwin documented that gaze fixation produces perceptual fading, a phenomenon rediscovered in 1804 by Ignaz Paul Vital Troxler. Studies in the twentieth century established that Jurin ' s ' eye trembling ' consisted of three main types of ' fixational ' eye movements, now called microsaccades (or fixational saccades), drifts and tremor. Yet, owing to the constant and minute nature of these motions, the study of their perceptual and physiological consequences has met significant technological challenges. Studies starting in the 1950s and continuing in the present have attempted to study vision during retinal stabilization-a technique that consists on shifting any and all visual stimuli presented to the eye in such a way as to nullify all concurrent eye movements-providing a tantalizing glimpse of vision in the absence of change. No research to date has achieved perfect retinal stabilization, however, and so other work has devised substitute ways to counteract eye motion, such as by studying the perception of afterimages or of the entoptic images formed by retinal vessels, which are completely stable with respect to the eye. Yet other research has taken the alternative tack to control eye motion by behavioural instruction to fix one ' s gaze or to keep one ' s gaze still, during concurrent physiological and/or psychophysical measurements. Here, we review the existing data-from historical and contemporary studies that have aimed to nullify or minimize eye motion-on the perceptual and physiological consequences of perfect versus imperfect fixation. We also discuss the accuracy, quality and stability of ocular fixation, and the bottom-up and top-down influences that affect fixation behaviour.

The Drake equation is a probabilistic framework for estimating the number of technological advanced civilizations in our Galaxy; however, many of the equation's component probabilities are either unknown or have large error intervals. In this paper, a different method of examining this question is explored, one that replaces the various Drake factors with the single estimate for the probability of life existing on Earth. This relationship can be described by the binomial distribution if the presence of life on a given number of planets is equated to successes in a Bernoulli trial. The question of exoplanet life may then be reformulated as follows - given the probability of one or more independent successes for a given number of trials, what is the probability of two or more successes? Some of the implications of this approach for finding life on exoplanets are discussed.","Authors":"Rossmo, DK (Rossmo, D.

Using NSOM measurements together with configuration interaction calculations, we identify the dots having different electron population N(N = 1-12), quantum confinement ((h) over bar omega(0) = 0.6-8 meV) and size D(D = 70-170 nm). For N = 2, we observed a magnetic-field-induced molecular-droplet transition, accompanied by the decomposition of the tetron into a Wigner molecule complex (WMC), and the activation of rotovibronic structure. For N = 1, unusually strong vibronic structure resulting from a trion-type WMC was observed. We have shown that magnetic-field-induced shifts of this structure allow measurement of single particle Fock-Darwin levels and angular momentum transitions of the WMC. In addition, we demonstrated the use of NSOM imaging to probe the charge density distribution and observed anomalous dependence of the image size on the quantum confinement, implying a pairing of electrons or formation of whispering gallery modes in the QD. We demonstrated that InP/GaInP QDs, provide a Wigner-Seitz radius (r(s)) up to 13, and that the measurements of NSOM magneto-optical spectroscopy using these dots makes it possible to study effects arising from strong Coulomb interaction of a few confined electrons (holes).","Authors":"Mintairov, AM (Mintairov, A.

The latter includes targeted treatment based on airway inflammation. We undertook a feasibility study in two Darwin schools with a high proportion of Indigenous youth to determine the feasibility of an innovative, peer-led, school-based education program called the Asthma and Smoking Prevention Project (ASPP). A subset of children with reported persistent respiratory symptoms were also clinically evaluated to determine the lower airway inflammatory profile and optimize asthma management. Methods: The ASPP is founded on an evidence-based three-step program and targets improving asthma management and preventing the uptake of tobacco smoking. The program uses a student-centered approach in which senior students (peer leaders) deliver the ASPP to Grade 7 students using activities, videos, and games. Students completed questionnaires related to asthma and smoking at baseline and 3 months after program delivery. Students with respiratory symptoms at 3 months were invited for a comprehensive clinical evaluation and tests including sputum induction. Results: The ASPP was well received.

This is unfortunate, because honeybees are more exposed to environmental stressors compared to other livestock and management can severely compromise bee health. Here, we briefly review apicultural factors that influence bee health and focus on those most likely interfering with natural selection, which offers a broad range of evolutionary applications for field practice. Despite intense breeding over centuries, natural selection appears to be much more relevant for the health of managed A. mellifera colonies than previously thought.

The phytoplankton encompasses a large taxon which, dependent on the source definition, can vary significantly. Traditionally, they would only include pelagic photosynthetic organisms (autotrophic), yet more recently the definition is being revised to include heterotrophic organisms. Recent advancements in oceanography over the past three decades have found the prevalence in the global ocean of cyanobacteria of sizes ranging from 0.5-1.5 mu m. Two cyanobacterial genera Synechoccocus and Prochlorococcus are now recognised to dominate phytoplankton cell counts and biomass specifically in the oligotrophic tropical and subtropical oceans. This study is the first to identify the importance of picoplankton as a foremost contributor to productivity in a macro-tidal ecosystem in Northern Tropical Australia. Picoplankton was found to be the dominant group of primary producers (> 99% or 6x10(9) cells/L) within the phytoplankton in Darwin Harbour during the dry season of 2013. The larger phytoplankton > 2 mu m contributed (< 0.05% or 2x10(2) cells/L) of the population. This study further defines the influences on this dynamic system that would allow the picoplankton community to thrive, highlighting the complexity of this nitrogen-limited system, where nutrient cycling, including nitrogen fixation mediated possibly through the microbial community, plays a pertinent role. Other environmental influences include spring tides, spatial variation and increased turbidity which benefits heterotrophy over autotrophy in this ecosystem.","Authors":"Purcell-Meyerink, D (Purcell-Meyerink, D.) ; Fortune, J (Fortune, J.) ; Butler, ECV (Butler, E.

However, a third form with intermediate anther distance has repeatedly been hypothesized but only hesitantly accepted. In addition, intermediate morphology has been also used as the main character of P. x hybrida. However, the status of some purported hybrid populations is challenged by the local lack of parental species, their successful reproduction and non-intermediate traits. Despite this unclear situation, detailed genetic and morphological analyses are lacking. Here, we studied morphology and molecular markers within the P. chlorantha/bifolia group in Central Europe. Three morphological groups emerged representing Pc, Pb and a third form, here informally referred to as non-hybrid intermediates (Pn). The latter is characterized, among other trait differences, by intermediate distance between anthers [(0.7)-1-2.2 mm] and long spurs (28-40 mm). Three gene pools were identified, which largely corresponded to the three morphological groups. The Pn gene pool had several high-frequency private alleles substantiating its genetic independence. Some of the Pn populations were previously interpreted as P. x hybrida suggesting that Pn was overlooked hitherto and mistaken to represent hybrids. The non-perfect fit between morphological and genetic groups highlights the potential for fast morphological evolution.

The evolutionary burst of species diversity and the \"struggle for existence\", as proposed by Darwin, generated a complex host defense system. Host survival during infection in vital organs, such as the lung, requires a delicate balance between host defense, which is essential for the detection and elimination of pathogens and host tolerance, which is critical for minimizing collateral tissue damage. Whereas the cellular and molecular mechanisms of host defense against many invading pathogens have been extensively studied, our understanding of host tolerance as a key mechanism in maintaining host fitness is extremely limited. This may also explain why current therapeutic and preventive approaches targeting only host defense mechanisms have failed to provide full protection against severe infectious diseases, including pulmonary influenza virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections.

This makes the hole systems very attractive for possible spintronics applications. In three dimensions (3D), the dynamics of holes is described by well-known Luttinger Hamiltonian. However, most recent spintronics applications are related to two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures where dynamics in one direction is frozen due to quantum confinement. The confinement results in dimensional reduction of the Luttinger Hamiltonian, 3D -> 2D. Due to the interplay of the spin-orbit interaction, the external magnetic field, and the lateral gate potential imposed on the heterostructure, the reduction is highly nontrivial and as yet unknown. In the present work we perform the reduction and hence derive the general effective Hamiltonian which describes spintronics effects in symmetric 2D heterostructures. In particular, we do the following: (i) derive the spin-orbit interaction and the Darwin interaction related to the lateral gate potential, (ii) determine the momentum-dependent out-of-plane g-factor, (iii) point out that there are two independent in-plane g-factors, (iv) determine momentum dependencies of the in-plane g-factors.","Authors":"Miserev, DS (Miserev, D.

As lineages diversify, an early and often rapid phase of species and trait proliferation gives way to evolutionary slow-downs as new species pack into ever more densely occupied regions of ecological niche space(6,8). Small clades such as Darwin's finches demonstrate that natural selection is the driving force of adaptive radiations, but how microevolutionary processes scale up to shape the expansion of phenotypic diversity over much longer evolutionary timescales is unclear(9). Here we address this problem on a global scale by analysing a crowdsourced dataset of three-dimensional scanned bill morphology from more than 2,000 species. We find that bill diversity expanded early in extant avian evolutionary history, before transitioning to a phase dominated by packing of morphological space. However, this early phenotypic diversification is decoupled from temporal variation in evolutionary rate: rates of bill evolution vary among lineages but are comparatively stable through time. We find that rare, but major, discontinuities in phenotype emerge from rapid increases in rate along single branches, sometimes leading to depauperate clades with unusual bill morphologies. Despite these jumps between groups, the major axes of within-group bill-shape evolution are remarkably consistent across birds. We reveal that macroevolutionary processes underlying global-scale adaptive radiations support Darwinian(9) and Simpsonian(4) ideas of microevolution within adaptive zones and accelerated evolution between distinct adaptive peaks.","Authors":"Cooney, CR (Cooney, Christopher R.) ; Bright, JA (Bright, Jen A.) ; Capp, EJR (Capp, Elliot J.

(1) Long-lived contrails and cirrus from overshooting convection are investigated above the tropical tropopause at low temperatures down to -88 degrees C from measurements with the Russian high-altitude research aircraft M-55 \"Geophysica\", as well as related observations during the SCOUT-O3 field experiment near Darwin, Australia, in 2005. A contrail was observed to persist below ice saturation at low temperatures and low turbulence in the stratosphere for nearly 1 h. The contrail occurred downwind of the decaying convective system \"Hector\" of 16 November 2005. The upper part of the contrail formed at 19 km altitude in the tropical lower stratosphere at similar to 60% relative humidity over ice at -82 degrees C. The similar to 1 h lifetime is explained by engine water emissions, slightly enhanced humidity from Hector, low temperature, low turbulence, and possibly nitric acid hydrate formation. The long persistence suggests large contrail coverage in case of a potential future increase of air traffic in the lower stratosphere. (2) Cirrus observed above the strongly convective Hector cloud on 30 November 2005 was previously interpreted as cirrus from overshooting convection. Here we show that parts of the cirrus were caused by contrails or are mixtures of convective and contrail cirrus. The in situ data together with data from an upward-looking lidar on the German research aircraft \"Falcon\", the CPOL radar near Darwin, and NOAA-AVHRR satellites provide a sufficiently complete picture to distinguish between contrail and convective cirrus parts. Plume positions are estimated based on measured or analyzed wind and parameterized wake vortex descent. Most of the non-volatile aerosol measured over Hector is traceable to aircraft emissions. Exhaust emission indices are derived from a self-match experiment of the Geophysica in the polar stratosphere in 2010. The number of ice particles in the contrails is less than 1% of the number of non-volatile aerosol particles, possibly because of sublimation losses and undetected very small ice particles. The radar data show that the ice water content in convective overshoots is far higher than measured along the flight path. These findings add insight into overshooting convection and are of relevance with respect to hydration of the lower stratosphere.","Authors":"Schumann, U (Schumann, Ulrich) ; Kiemle, C (Kiemle, Christoph) ; Schlager, H (Schlager, Hans) ; Weigel, R (Weigel, Ralf) ; Borrmann, S (Borrmann, Stephan) ; D'Amato, F (D'Amato, Francesco) ; Kramer, M (Kraemer, Martina) ; Matthey, R (Matthey, Renaud) ; Protat, A (Protat, Alain) ; Voigt, C (Voigt, Christiane) ; Volk, CM (Volk, C.

This is especially true for the role of anecic earthworms in SOM formation, which was first observed in the classical investigations of Charles Darwin in 1881. Despite the large number of earthworm studies available in the literature, more attention has been paid to the role of these organisms in loss of carbon through decomposition and nutrient release than to their role in SOM formation. A set of anecic earthworm parameters were compiled or developed for ease of incorporation as a module into the SOM dynamics model Romul_Hum, which also represents the SOM forming activities of soil micro-and meso-biota. An approach was developed for initialization of earthworm biomass in the absence of measured biomass, and parameters were developed for food palatability, ingestion and egestion. The eco-physiological parameters of food consumption, excretion efficiency, assimilation efficiency, lifespan, and mortality for anecic earthworms were developed using an approach similar to that for food web mesofauna in the Romul_Hum. Parameters for processes unique to freshly excreted casts were developed to include rapid mineralization of SOM and nitrogen, SOM formation, and high nitrogen fixation rates. The addition of the earthworm module to the Romul_Hum model allows assessment of the combined effects of earthworms cast production, and micro-and mesofaunal food web activity within the casts, on the formation of stable SOM.

Ocean warming and acidification are likely to enforce changes in the biofilm community and inturn influence the settlement process. Hence, we evaluated the influence of biofilm (multispecies and unialgal) and diet-mediated changes on the settlement of Balanus amphitrite cyprids (presettlement non feeding larval stage) under different combinations of temperature (28, 30, 32 and 34 degrees C), pCO(2) (400, 750 and 1500 mu atm) and nutrient (unenriched and f/2 enriched). Nutrient enrichment enhanced the diatom and bacterial abundance at ambient temperature (30 degrees C) and pCO(2) (400 mu atm), which inturn increased larval settlement. Elevated pCO(2) (750 and 1500 mu atm) had no direct effect but a variable cascading effect on the settlement via biofilm-mediated changes was observed, depending on the type of biofilm. In contrast, elevated temperature (32 and 34 degrees C), either individually or in combination with elevated pCO(2) had direct negative effect on settlement. However, biofilm-mediated changes compensated this negative effect. The larval settlement was also influenced by changes in the larval diet. Under elevated temperature and pCO(2), cyprids raised with a feed (Chaetoceros calcitrans) from ambient temperature and pCO(2) were of poor quality (lower RNA:DNA ratio, lower protein synthetic capacity) and yielded lower settlement. However, cyprids raised with a feed from elevated temperature and pCO(2) were of better quality (higher RNA:DNA ratio, higher protein synthetic capacity) and yielded higher settlement. Overall, the observations from the present study provide insights into the significance of biotic interactions on the coastal biofouling communities under future climatic scenario and emphasise the need for future experiments on these aspects.

However, for all that we now understand about the conserved mechanisms of limb development and the development of gross morphological disturbances, little of what is presented in the experimental or medical literature reflects the remarkable diversity resulting from the 450 million year experiment of natural selection. An understanding of conserved and divergent limb morphologies in this new age of genomics and genome engineering promises to reveal more of the developmental potential residing in all limbs and to unravel the mechanisms of evolutionary variation in limb size and shape. In this review, we present the current state of our rapidly advancing understanding of the evolutionary origin of hands and feet and highlight what is known about the mechanisms that shape diverse limbs.

The two classic examples of adaptive radiation are Darwin's finches and the Hawaiian honeycreepers, which evolved remarkable levels of adaptive cranial morphological variation. To gain new insights into the nature of their diversification, we performed comparative three-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses based on X-ray microcomputed tomography (mCT) scanning of dried cranial skeletons. We show that cranial shapes in both Hawaiian honeycreepers and Coerebinae (Darwin's finches and their close relatives) are much more diverse than in their respective outgroups, but Hawaiian honeycreepers as a group display the highest diversity and disparity of all other bird groups studied. We also report a significant contribution of allometry to skull shape variation, and distinct patterns of evolutionary change in skull morphology in the two lineages of songbirds that underwent adaptive radiation on oceanic islands. These findings help to better understand the nature of adaptive radiations in general and provide a foundation for future investigations on the developmental and molecular mechanisms underlying diversification of these morphologically distinguished groups of birds.

We tested this hypothesis by adding carbon (C), phosphorus (P), and molybdenum (Mo) independently or in combination, and nitrogen (N) only to symbiotic, epiphylls on bryophytes, and free-living diazotrophs in three stages of glacier foreland succession in Cordillera Darwin (55 degrees S), southern South America. Experiments were run in spring 2013 and 2014 and in autumn 2015. Diazotrophic activity (DA) was assessed by the acetylene reduction assay. Results showed no effect of C, P, or Mo added either singly or in combination in the spring incubations. During autumn, DA was enhanced by adding a mix of C, P, and Mo to the symbiotic N-2-fixing Gunnera magellanica from young successional sites, while in the late successional sites, adding C and Mo alone to the diverse bryophyte carpet on the forest floor enhanced DA. Nitrogen added as ammonium sulfate had a strong negative effect on N-2 fixation by free-living diazotrophs in the spring and autumn samples from the late successional site, in the bryophyte carpet from the early successional site (autumn), and in Pseudocyphellaria freycinetii of the midsuccessional site (spring). As in other high-latitude biomes, symbiotic and epiphyllous associations and free-living diazotrophs play a crucial role in the incorporation of new N to postglacial subantarctic forest ecosystems, especially in recently exposed substrates that are strongly limited by nutrient availability in soils. The increasing rates of glacier melting in southern South America is exposing new substrates to microbial colonization, including diazotrophic bacteria. In this environment, largely free of reactive N from atmospheric sources, new ecosystems are rapidly developing on deglaciated surfaces, provided that key elements such as Mo and P and C are present in the substrates.","Authors":"Perez, CA (Perez, Cecilia A.) ; Silva, WA (Silva, Wladimir A.) ; Aravena, JC (Aravena, Juan C.) ; Armesto, JJ (Armesto, Juan J.)","Title":"Limitations and relevance of biological nitrogen fixation during postglacial succession in Cordillera Darwin, Tierra del Fuego, Chile"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395195800010 ISSN: 1479-2621 eISSN: 1479-263X","Keywords":"genetic diversity; HPLC; markers; Picrorhiza kurroa; picrosides; SSR KeyWords Plus:EST-SSR MARKERS; ORYZA-SATIVA L.; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; CONSERVATION; CULTIVARS; PLANTS; RICE; WILD; DNA; MICROSATELLITES","Categories":"Plant Sciences; Genetics & Heredity Web of Science Categories:Plant Sciences; Genetics & Heredity","Journal Information":"PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES-CHARACTERIZATION AND UTILIZATION Volume: 15 Issue: 1 Pages: 79-88 DOI: 10.1017/S1479262115000404 Published: FEB 2017","Abstract":"Picrorhiza kurroa (family Scrophulariaceae) is a high value medicinal herb used in herbal drug formulations like picroliv, picrolax, etc. It has been collected recklessly from its natural habitat posing endangered status for its existence, thereby necessitating characterization of genetic diversity for its sustainable utilization and conservation.

Picroside-I (P-I) content ranged from 0.37 to 2.7% in fresh shoots whereas total picrosides content (P-I+P-II) ranged from 3.7 to 10.9% in dry rhizomes. High picrosides content accession PKS-1 was identified, both for shoots and rhizomes. To study genetic diversity and correlate picrosides content with their genetic factors, genetic profiling was done using simple sequence repeats (SSRs) identified from P. kurroa transcriptomes. Out of 361 SSR primers tested on 26 accessions, 35 primers yielded polymorphic profiles. Overall low genetic diversity was observed in P. kurroa accessions. The highest polymorphism information content (PIC) of 0.55 was given by SSR marker PKSTS-P9 (TGGTG)(4). Mean allele number was 2.97.

Flowers are considered to be an assembly of protective, attractive, and reproductive male and female leaf-like organs. Their origin cannot be understood by a morphological comparison to gymnosperms, their closest relatives, which develop separate male or female cones. Despite these morphological differences, gymnosperms and angiosperms possess a similar genetic toolbox consisting of phylogenetically related MADS domain proteins. Using ancestral MADS domain protein reconstruction, we trace the evolution of organ identity quartets along the stem lineage of crown angiosperms. We provide evidence that current floral quartets specifying male organ identity, which consist of four types of subunits, evolved from ancestral complexes of two types of subunits through gene duplication and integration of SEPALLATA proteins just before the origin of flowering plants. Our results suggest that protein interaction changes underlying this compositional shift were the result of a gradual and reversible evolutionary trajectory. Modeling shows that such compositional changes may have facilitated the evolution of the perfect, bisexual flower.","Authors":"Ruelens, P (Ruelens, Philip) ; Zhang, ZC (Zhang, Zhicheng) ; van Mourik, H (van Mourik, Hilda) ; Maere, S (Maere, Steven) ; Kaufmann, K (Kaufmann, Kerstin) ; Geuten, K (Geuten, Koen) Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number Maere, Steven  http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5341-136X Geuten, Koen  http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9692-4499","Title":"The Origin of Floral Organ Identity Quartets"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397014600001 ISSN: 0954-4879 eISSN: 1365-3121","Categories":"Geology Web of Science Categories:Geosciences, Multidisciplinary","Journal Information":"TERRA NOVA Volume: 29 Issue: 1 Pages: 1-12 DOI: 10.1111/ter.12247 Published: FEB 2017","Abstract":"The origin of oceanic islands has been the subject of much speculation, starting with Darwin almost two centuries ago. Two classes of oceanic islands can be identified: 'volcanic islands', which form due to excess volcanism caused by melting anomalies in the suboceanic mantle, and 'tectonic islands', which form due to transpressive and/or transtensional tectonics of blocks of oceanic lithosphere along transform faults. Modern and sunken tectonic islands from the Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and Red Sea expose mantle and lower-crust lithologies and display an elongated narrow morphology; in contrast, volcanic islands expose basalts and have near-circular morphology. Both are often capped by carbonate platforms. The life cycle of tectonic islands tends to be more complex than that of most volcanic islands; their elongated narrow morphology, together with their tectonic instability and high seismicity, affect the architecture of the carbonate platforms capping them, limiting coral reef development and favouring rhodalgal-foramol biota associations.","Authors":"Palmiotto, C (Palmiotto, Camilla) ; Corda, L (Corda, Laura) ; Bonatti, E (Bonatti, Enrico)","Title":"Oceanic tectonic islands"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000394076200024 ISSN: 0964-8305 eISSN: 1879-0208","Keywords":"Barnacle larvae; Biofouling; Microbial community; Larval settlement; Invertebrate metamorphosis; Neurotransmitter; Larval metabolism KeyWords Plus:MARINE INVERTEBRATE LARVAE; ADRENOCEPTOR COMPOUNDS PREVENT; AMPHITRITE AMPHITRITE DARWIN; MUSSEL MYTILUS-CORUSCUS; PROTEIN-KINASE-C; BALANUS-AMPHITRITE; METHYL FARNESOATE; AMPHIBALANUS-AMPHITRITE; JUVENILE-HORMONE; BUGULA-NERITINA","Categories":"Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology Web of Science Categories:Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Environmental Sciences","Journal Information":"INTERNATIONAL BIODETERIORATION & BIODEGRADATION Volume: 117 Pages: 190-196 DOI: 10.1016/j.ibiod.2017.01.003 Published: FEB 2017","Abstract":"Effects of select pharmacological compounds, with known mode of action in vertebrates, were evaluated on the development, metabolism and settlement of larvae of the common fouling barnacle, Amphibalanus amphitrite.

By accessing genetic datasets through museum sampling, we are able to put current levels of genetic diversity and hybridization with congenerics into a historical context for enhanced conservation. In this study, we compared neutral genetic diversity of the now extinct Fernandina population to historical and current diversity of the Isabela population using 14 microsatellite markers. We found that current genetic diversity of the last remnant population (similar to 80-100 individuals) is far below levels 100 years ago, with only about half of the allelic diversity retained. Current genetic diversity is close to levels in the Fernandina population that went extinct by the 1970s. Bottleneck analysis did not show a strong signature of recent decline, and instead implies that this species may have consistently had low population sizes with wide fluctuations. Hybridization with congeneric woodpecker finches was found in the modern Isabela population, implying that some individuals within the few remaining breeding pairs are finding mates with woodpecker finches. Within the context of historical low population sizes and wide fluctuations, current conservation efforts may help the mangrove finch face current extinction threats and avoid the fate of the Fernandina population. However, this historically small lineage will likely continue to face challenges associated with small specialist species surrounded by a widely-distributed sister lineage producing viable hybrids.","Authors":"Lawson, LP (Lawson, Lucinda P.) ; Fessl, B (Fessl, Birgit) ; Vargas, FH (Vargas, F.

Surface wettability affected BF characteristics. The standardized harmonic mean and water contact angles values were not correlated with diatom density and chlorophyll a concentration, but were correlated with bacterial density, dry weight, and thickness. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed that bacterial community structure differed on BFs on surfaces of varying wettability.

Similarly, the bacteriocin incorporated epoxy based paint formulation exhibited antifouling property for 3 months. The bacteriocin of P. aeruginosa which exhibited antifouling activity was characterised using GC-MS and identified the active compounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This extends to information foraging, where a knowledge-seeker shifts between reading in depth and studying new domains. To study this decision making process, we examine the reading choices made by one of the most celebrated scientists of the modern era: Charles Darwin. From the full-text of books listed in his chronologically-organized reading journals, we generate topic models to quantify his local (text-to-text) and global (text-to-past) reading decisions using Kullback-Liebler Divergence, a cognitively-validated, information-theoretic measure of relative surprise. Rather than a pattern of surprise-minimization, corresponding to a pure exploitation strategy, Darwin's behavior shifts from early exploitation to later exploration, seeking unusually high levels of cognitive surprise relative to previous eras. These shifts, detected by an unsupervised Bayesian model, correlate with major intellectual epochs of his career as identified both by qualitative scholarship and Darwin's own self-commentary. Our methods allow us to compare his consumption of texts with their publication order. We find Darwin's consumption more exploratory than the culture's production, suggesting that underneath gradual societal changes are the explorations of individual synthesis and discovery. Our quantitative methods advance the study of cognitive search through a framework for testing interactions between individual and collective behavior and between short-and long-term consumption choices. This novel application of topic modeling to characterize individual reading complements widespread studies of collective scientific behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Species interactions have long been thought to be key drivers of trait evolution. However, models for comparative data that account for interactions between species are lacking. One of the challenges is that such models are intractable and difficult to express analytically. Here we present phylogenetic models of trait evolution that include interspecific competition among chosen species. Competition is modeled as a tendency of sympatric species to evolve toward difference from one another, producing trait overdispersion and high phylogenetic signal. The model predicts elevated trait variance across species and a slowdown in evolutionary rate both across the clade and within each branch. The model also predicts a reduction in correlation between otherwise correlated traits. We use an approximate Bayesian computation approach to estimate model parameters. We find reasonable power to detect competition in sufficiently large (20 + species) trees compared with Brownian trait evolution and with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and early burst models. We apply the model to examine the evolution of bill morphology of Darwin's finches and find evidence that competition affects the evolution of bill length.","Authors":"Clarke, M (Clarke, Magnus) ; Thomas, GH (Thomas, Gavin H.) ; Freckleton, RP (Freckleton, Robert P.)","Title":"Trait Evolution in Adaptive Radiations: Modeling and Measuring Interspecific Competition on Phylogenies"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Review Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000391933400009 ISSN: 1366-9516 eISSN: 1472-4642","Keywords":"biodiversity patterns; coastal forest; ecosystem function; lagoon; swamp; transboundary KeyWords Plus:CONSERVATION PRIORITIES; DARWIN HARBOR; DIVERSITY; HABITAT; AUSTRALIA; WORLD; ABUNDANCE; PRIMATES; ORIGINS; FORESTS","Categories":"Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology Web of Science Categories:Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology","Journal Information":"DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS Volume: 23 Issue: 2 Pages: 221-230 DOI: 10.1111/ddi.12514 Published: FEB 2017","Abstract":"Aim Despite mangrove forests spanning marine, freshwater and terrestrial realms, their function as terrestrial ecosystems has been largely ignored. In the light of the rapid global decline of mangroves, it is critical to build a more holistic understanding to plan for effective management of the whole ecosystem. This study examines the importance of mangrove forests for terrestrial vertebrates. Location Global mangrove forests. Methods An extensive review of records of the use of global mangrove forests by the most poorly studied terrestrial vertebrate groups: mammals, reptiles and amphibians. We explored the species richness and distribution of these groups, along with their ecological characteristics. We also explored the relationship between animal and plant species richness across the distribution of mangrove forests. Results Mangroves are used by a remarkable number of terrestrial mammal, reptile and amphibian species (n = 464); five times more than previously reported. The diversity of species uncovered by this study, almost half of which are of conservation concern, underscores the value of mangroves as terrestrial ecosystems. Most species were facultative users of mangroves; however, there are critical knowledge gaps in how these species interact with these ecosystems. We found a positive global correlation between animal and mangrove plant richness. Main conclusions This study highlights that mangrove forests are considerably more important for terrestrial animals than generally acknowledged. We present the most comprehensive review of the importance of mangrove forests for terrestrial vertebrates, but also reveal significant knowledge gaps in the ecology of these ecosystems. Our study uncovers evidence that these habitats may be increasingly important as refuges for species from anthropocentric disturbance. Our findings emphasize the importance of moving beyond viewing mangroves as marine ecosystems, towards recognizing their cross-realm importance. Without such a shift, there will be significant limitations in our ability to manage and conserve these ecosystems.","Authors":"Rog, SM (Rog, Stefanie M.) ; Clarke, RH (Clarke, Rohan H.) ; Cook, CN (Cook, Carly N.)

Periodic traveling waves are observed in numerical simulations. Existence of stationary solutions in the form of pulses is shown, and transition from periodic waves to pulses is studied. In the applications to the speciation theory, the results of this work signify that new species can emerge only if they do not have common offsprings.

TCCON FTS observations have previously been used to validate satellite estimations of XCO2; however, our knowledge of the short-term spatial and temporal variations in XCO2 surrounding the TCCON sites is limited. In this work, we use the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) Eulerian three-dimensional transport model and the FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model) Lagrangian particle dispersion model (LPDM) to determine the footprints of short-term variations in XCO2 observed by operational, past, future and possible TCCON sites. We propose a footprint-based method for the collocation of satellite and TCCON XCO2 observations and estimate the performance of the method using the NIES model and five GOSAT (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite) XCO2 product data sets. Comparison of the proposed approach with a standard geographic method shows a higher number of collocation points and an average bias reduction up to 0.15 ppm for a subset of 16 stations for the period from January 2010 to January 2014. Case studies of the Darwin and Reunion Island sites reveal that when the footprint area is rather curved, non-uniform and significantly different from a geographical rectangular area, the differences between these approaches are more noticeable. This emphasises that the collocation is sensitive to local meteorological conditions and flux distributions.","Authors":"Belikov, DA (Belikov, Dmitry A.)[ 1,2,3,17 ] ; Maksyutov, S (Maksyutov, Shamil) ; Ganshin, A (Ganshin, Alexander) ; Zhuravlev, R (Zhuravlev, Ruslan) ; Deutscher, NM (Deutscher, Nicholas M.) ; Wunch, D (Wunch, Debra) ; Feist, DG (Feist, Dietrich G.) ; Morino, I (Morino, Isamu) ; Parker, RJ (Parker, Robert J.) ; Strong, K (Strong, Kimberly)[ 10 ] ; Yoshida, Y (Yoshida, Yukio) ; Bril, A (Bril, Andrey)[ 11 ] ; Oshchepkov, S (Oshchepkov, Sergey)[ 11 ] ; Boesch, H (Boesch, Hartmut) ; Dubey, MK (Dubey, Manvendra K.)[ 12 ] ; Griffith, D (Griffith, David) ; Hewson, W (Hewson, Will) ; Kivi, R (Kivi, Rigel)[ 13 ] ; Mendonca, J (Mendonca, Joseph)[ 10 ] ; Notholt, J (Notholt, Justus) ; Schneider, M (Schneider, Matthias)[ 14 ] ; Sussmann, R (Sussmann, Ralf)[ 15 ] ; Velazco, VA (Velazco, Voltaire A.) ; Aoki, S (Aoki, Shuji)[ 16 ] ...More...Less Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number Belikov, Dmitry  I-9877-2016   Schneider, Matthias  B-1441-2013   Dubey, Manvendra  E-3949-2010 http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3492-790X Morino, Isamu  K-1033-2014 http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2720-1569 Notholt, Justus  P-4520-2016 http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3324-885X Boesch, Hartmut  G-6021-2012   Feist, Dietrich  B-6489-2013 http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5890-6687 Maksyutov, Shamil  G-6494-2011 http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1200-9577","Title":"Study of the footprints of short-term variation in XCO2 observed by TCCON sites using NIES and FLEXPART atmospheric transport models"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398082100002 ISSN: 0067-270X eISSN: 1945-5534","Keywords":"Early hominins; carnivory; zooarchaeology; taphonomy; referential behavioural models KeyWords Plus:BONOBOS PAN-PANISCUS; SURFACE MODIFICATION MODELS; INFERRING FOSSIL HOMININ; SALONGA NATIONAL-PARK; OLDUVAI-GORGE; EARLY HOMO; ARDIPITHECUS-RAMIDUS; EARLY PLEISTOCENE; WILD CHIMPANZEES; STONE TOOLS","Categories":"Archaeology Web of Science Categories:Archaeology","Journal Information":"AZANIA-ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN AFRICA Volume: 52 Issue: 1 Pages: 4-32 DOI: 10.1080/0067270X.2016.1252066 Published: 2017","Abstract":"Natural selection, as both a process and a scientific concept, is eloquently simple. Unfortunately, this simplicity sometimes belies Darwin's broader view of evolution as a multifaceted process that proceeds from both ecological pressures and phylogenetic history. Darwin further understood that it is not just physical traits that are transmitted generationally, but also behavioural patterns, both of which are subject to the shaping influences of environment and phylogeny. Chimpanzees, bonobos and humans are the most carnivorous extant primates, an observation that serves as the basis of our extended argument that vertebrate predation is a synapomorphy of these sister taxa. From there, we use archaeological data to trace the inferred polarity of hominin carcass foraging and meat-eating from their first archaeological indications similar to 2.6 million years ago (Mya). A review of the early Pleistocene African record demonstrates that taphonomic evidence of a hominin predatory/meat-eating behavioral module clarifies similar to 2.0 Mya, a critical time period characterised by traces of advanced carcass foraging, which, in turn, suggest that an earlier phase(s) of vertebrate capture by hominins was/were simpler. In rounding out this meta-analytical consideration of hominin carnivory, we draw on comparative primatology, ecology and archaeology in order to build a holistic model of this fundamental behavioural adaptation.","Authors":"Dominguez-Rodrigo, M (Dominguez-Rodrigo, Manuel) ; Pickering, TR (Pickering, Travis Rayne)","Title":"The meat of the matter: an evolutionary perspective on human carnivory"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398072600004 PubMed ID: 27715716 ISSN: 0022-2895 eISSN: 1940-1027","Keywords":"cognition; motor control; motor learning; motor imagery; pupil diameter KeyWords Plus:MENTAL-IMAGERY; HAND MOVEMENTS; SIZE; DILATION; REPRESENTATIONS; ATTENTION; MEMORY; BRAIN; LOAD","Categories":"Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychology; Sport Sciences Web of Science Categories:Neurosciences; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental; Sport Sciences","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF MOTOR BEHAVIOR Volume: 49 Issue: 2 Pages: 141-149 DOI: 10.1080/00222895.2016.1161593 Published: 2017","Abstract":"Non-luminance-mediated changes in pupil diameter have been used since the first studies by Darwin in 1872 as indicators of clinical, cognitive, and arousal states.

First, the step size of the cursor's random walk was either large or small leading to 2 task difficulties ( difficult or easy). Second, they instructed participants to imagine controlling the cursor by moving the mouse, but without actually moving it ( task modality: imagined movement or real movement condition). Task difficulty and modality allowed the authors to show that pupil diameters reflect processes involved in motor control and in the processing of feedback, respectively. Furthermore, the authors also demonstrate that motor learning can be quantified by pupil size.

In this context, I review J. Turner's conception of \"evolutionary sociology\" as an attempt of sociological reception of the modern evolutionary synthesis in behavioral sciences. While Turner is given credit for drawing sociologists' attention to modern evolutionary conceptions of morality, I also criticize his approach for over-emphasizing the historical perspective of the hominid evolution and lack of elaboration of this conceptions to the studies of morality in modern societies; at the same time I argue that classical sociology of morality still has large theoretical resources which can be integrated with modern evolutionary perspective, so that moral phenomena would receive a more rigorous scientific explanation.","Authors":"Bykov, AV (Bykov, A.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a new chemical thinner 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) on 'Laetitia', 'Fortune', and 'African Rose (TM)'. ACC was also combined with 6-benzyl adenine (6-BA) and in one season on 'African Rose (TM)' with mechanical thinning using the Darwin 300 (TM) or hand thinning during bloom. All the foliar applications were made when the average fruitlet diameter was 7-10 mm using a spray volume of 1000 L.ha(-1) under slow drying conditions. Significant thinning effects were found in all the trials conducted over the two seasons. ACC consistently reduced the hand-thinning requirement at commercial hand thinning in both seasons in 'African Rose (TM)'. In the second season there was a linear decrease in yield and an increase in fruit size as the ACC rate increased from the low to medium rate before flattening off. The combination treatment of ACC and the Darwin 300((TM)) used in the 'African Rose((TM))' trial thinned more aggressively, improved fruit size and shifted harvest earlier. The yield however was not lower than that of the control treatment. 6-BA was included in all trials to prevent ACC-induced leaf drop, and generally did not thin fruitlets, except in the case of 'Laetitia' where the combination with ACC resulted in stronger thinning. Cultivars differed in their sensitivity to ACC and the rate for each cultivar should be determined separately.

Hamilton's (1964) theory of inclusive fitness provided an explanation by showing how cooperative behaviors could be adaptive if directed at closely related kin. Recent studies, however, have begun to question whether kin selection is sufficient to explain cooperative behavior in some species (Bergmuller, Johnstone, Russell, & Bshary, 2007). Many researchers have instead emphasized the importance of direct fitness benefits for helpers in the evolution of cooperative breeding systems. Furthermore, individuals can vary in who, when, and how much they help, and the factors that affect this variation are poorly understood (Cockburn, 1998; Heinsohn, 2004). Cooperative breeders thus provide excellent models for the study of evolutionary theories of cooperation and conflict (Cant, 2012).","Authors":"Erb, WM (Erb, Wendy M.) ; Porter, LM (Porter, Leila M.)","Title":"Mother's little helpers: What we know (and don't know) about cooperative infant care in callitrichines"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Review Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395175300001 PubMed ID: 27491339 ISSN: 1552-5007 eISSN: 1552-5015","Categories":"Evolutionary Biology; Developmental Biology; Zoology Web of Science Categories:Evolutionary Biology; Developmental Biology; Zoology","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL EVOLUTION Volume: 328 Issue: 1-2 Pages: 5-40 DOI: 10.1002/jez.b.22687 Published: JAN-FEB 2017","Abstract":"Famous for its blind cavefish and Darwin's finches, Latin America is home to some of the richest biodiversity hotspots of our planet.

But, what are the historical and present contributions of the Latin American scientific community to Evo-Devo? Here, we provide the first comprehensive overview of the Evo-Devo laboratories based in Latin America and describe current lines of research based on endemic species, focusing on body plans and patterning, systematics, physiology, computational modeling approaches, ecology, and domestication. Literature searches reveal that Evo-Devo in Latin America is still in its early days; while showing encouraging indicators of productivity, it has not stabilized yet, because it relies on few and sparsely distributed laboratories. Coping with the rapid changes in national scientific policies and contributing to solve social and health issues specific to each region are among the main challenges faced by Latin American researchers. The 2015 inaugural meeting of the Pan-American Society for Evolutionary Developmental Biology played a pivotal role in bringing together Latin American researchers eager to initiate and consolidate regional and worldwide collaborative networks. Such networks will undoubtedly advance research on the extremely high genetic and phenotypic biodiversity of Latin America, bound to be an almost infinite source of amazement and fascinating findings for the Evo-Devo community.","Authors":"Marcellini, S (Marcellini, Sylvain) ; Gonzalez, F (Gonzalez, Favio) ; Sarrazin, AF (Sarrazin, Andres F.) ; Pabon-Mora, N (Pabon-Mora, Natalia) ; Benitez, M (Benitez, Mariana) ; Pineyro-Nelson, A (Pineyro-Nelson, Alma) ; Rezende, GL (Rezende, Gustavo L.) ; Maldonado, E (Maldonado, Ernesto) ; Schneider, PN (Schneider, Patricia Neiva) ; Grizante, MB (Grizante, Mariana B.)[ 10 ] ; Da Fonseca, RN (Da Fonseca, Rodrigo Nunes)[ 11 ] ; Vergara-Silva, F (Vergara-Silva, Francisco)[ 12 ] ; Suaza-Gaviria, V (Suaza-Gaviria, Vanessa) ; Zumajo-Cardona, C (Zumajo-Cardona, Cecilia) ; Zattara, EE (Zattara, Eduardo E.)[ 13 ] ; Casasa, S (Casasa, Sofia)[ 13 ] ; Suarez-Baron, H (Suarez-Baron, Harold) ; Brown, FD (Brown, Federico D.)[ 14 ] ...More...Less Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number Schneider, Patricia  F-4372-2017 http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9745-0694 Brown, Federico  B-2035-2013 http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9250-5011 Zattara, Eduardo  http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9947-9036","Title":"Evolutionary Developmental Biology (Evo-Devo) Research in Latin America"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395098100002 ISSN: 0278-7407 eISSN: 1944-9194","Keywords":"shortening; structural style; basement thrust sheet; overpressured detachment; Fuegian Andes; Austral-Magallanes basin KeyWords Plus:TIERRA-DEL-FUEGO; DARWIN METAMORPHIC COMPLEX; FAULT INVERSION VS.; BACK-ARC BASIN; CORDILLERA-DARWIN; PATAGONIAN-ANDES; FORELAND THRUST; CORE COMPLEX; T PATHS; ARGENTINA","Categories":"Geochemistry & Geophysics Web of Science Categories:Geochemistry & Geophysics","Journal Information":"TECTONICS Volume: 36 Issue: 1 Pages: 33-50 DOI: 10.1002/2016TC004349 Published: JAN 2017","Abstract":"Published balanced structural interpretations of the Fuegian thrust-fold belt (southernmost Andes) fail to address aspects such as basement shortening in the thrust-fold belt or its structural connection with the central belt of the orogen. We tackle this deficiency by constructing four serial balanced cross sections based on surface geologic information, 2-D reflection seismic lines, and well logs, which depict the first-order structural geometry and kinematics from the thrust front to the internal thrust-fold belt. The interpretation reveals three main tectonostratigraphic packages separated by major detachments: basement (Paleozoic-Upper Jurassic), Cretaceous, and Paleogene, all variably involved in thrusting along strike. Minimum shortening in the Paleogene cover ranges between 16% and 43%, and significant style changes are observed across and along the thrust wedge. We show that basement thrust sheets have a major role in the construction of the thrust-fold belt; some of them were emplaced below the thrust front during late Oligocene or early Miocene times. The kinematic evolution of the thrust-fold belt indicates that the active detachments depended on the existence of high pore pressure to propagate forward. Our model shows that this pore pressure buildup was controlled by overburden, mean rock impermeability, and strain rate; the variable interaction among these factors controlled the propagation and style of the thrust wedge.","Authors":"Carbonell, PJT (Torres Carbonell, Pablo J.) ; Arias, LR (Rodriguez Arias, Leonardo) ; Atencio, MR (Atencio, Mario R.)","Title":"Geometry and kinematics of the Fuegian thrust-fold belt, southernmost Andes"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396526300035 ISSN: 2150-8925","Keywords":"ecoimmunology; enemy release hypothesis; host defense hypothesis; invasive species; tolerance KeyWords Plus:ENEMY RELEASE HYPOTHESIS; PHILORNIS-DOWNSI DIPTERA; DARWINS FINCH; BLUE TITS; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; TROGLODYTES-AEDON; HOUSE WRENS; SURVIVAL; ECTOPARASITES; MUSCIDAE","Categories":"Environmental Sciences & Ecology Web of Science Categories:Ecology","Journal Information":"ECOSPHERE Volume: 8 Issue: 1 Article Number: e01670 DOI: 10.1002/ecs2.1670 Published: JAN 2017","Abstract":"Introduced parasites threaten host populations around the world. For example, introduced parasitic nest flies (Philornis downsi) have contributed to the decline of several species of Darwin's finches in the Galapagos Islands. Introduced parasites are thought to have severe effects on native hosts because the hosts do not have effective defenses against such parasites and/or because introduced parasites have escaped the native enemies that keep their own populations in check. Studying effects of parasites on native hosts is an essential step in testing these causal hypotheses. We conducted a field experiment to assess the virulence of a native species of Philornis (Philornis trinitensis), which parasitizes birds on the island of Tobago. We manipulated flies in nests of black-faced grassquits (Tiaris bicolor), a close relative of Darwin's finches, as well as tropical mockingbirds (Mimus gilvus), a congener of the Galapagos mockingbird (Mimus parvulus). We predicted that P. trinitensis would be relatively avirulent because its native hosts in Tobago have had time to evolve effective defenses against it. We also noted the presence of parasitoids and other enemies of Philornis in Tobago nests. Surprisingly, effects of native P. trinitensis on Tobago birds were similar to the effects of introduced P. downsi on birds in the Galapagos. Flies reduced the reproductive success of grassquits, but not mockingbirds, which are also relatively unaffected by Philornis in the Galapagos. Thus, native Philornis flies are not less virulent than introduced flies. The prevalence of Philornis in Tobago was lower than the prevalence of Philornis in the Galapagos. Presumed enemies of Philornis (parasitoid wasps and ants) were relatively common in nests of birds in Tobago, but largely absent from nests in the Galapagos. We suggest that introduced P. downsi in the Galapagos is widespread, not because hosts lack defenses, but because it has left its enemies behind.","Authors":"Knutie, SA (Knutie, Sarah A.) ; Herman, JM (Herman, Jordan M.) ; Owen, JP (Owen, Jeb P.) ; Clayton, DH (Clayton, Dale H.)","Title":"Tri-trophic ecology of native parasitic nest flies of birds in Tobago"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000393612500015 ISSN: 0950-091X eISSN: 1365-2117","Categories":"Geology Web of Science Categories:Geosciences, Multidisciplinary","Journal Information":"BASIN RESEARCH Volume: 29 Issue: FEB Pages: 298-326 Supplement: S1 DOI: 10.1111/bre.12150 Published: 2017","Abstract":"Magallanes-Austral Basin (MAB) fill is preserved along a >1000km north-south trending outcrop belt in the southern Patagonia region of Argentina and Chile. Although the stratigraphic evolution of the MAB has been well documented in the Chilean sector (referred to as the Magallanes Basin), its northern terminus in southern Argentina (Austral Basin) is poorly constrained. We present new stratigraphic and geochronologic analyses of the early basin fill (Aptian-Turonian) from the Argentine sector (49-51 degrees S) of the MAB to document spatial variability in stratigraphy and timing of deposition during the initial stages of basin evolution. The initiation of the retroarc foreland basin fill is marked by the transition from mudstone to coarse-clastic deposition, which is characterised by the consistent presence of sandstone beds>ca. 20cm thick interpreted to represent sediment gravity flows deposited in a submarine fan system. Depositional environments within the early fill of the basin range from lower to upper deep-water fan settings as well as previously undocumented slope deposits. These facies are present as far north as El Chalten, Argentina (ca. 49 degrees S), indicating that facies-equivalent rocks can be traced along-strike for at least 5 degrees of latitude, based on correlation with strata as far south as the Cordillera Darwin (ca. 54 degrees S). Eight new U-Pb zircon ages from ash beds reveal an overall southward younging trend in the initiation of coarse clastic deposition. Inferred depositional ages range from ca. 115 +/- 1.9Ma in the northernmost study area to not older than 92 +/- 1Ma and 89 +/- 1.5Ma in the central and southern sectors respectively. The apparent diachronous delivery of coarse detritus into the basin may reflect (1) gradual southward progradation of a deep-water fan system from a northerly point source and/or (2) orogen-parallel variations in the timing and magnitude of thrust-belt deformation and erosion that provided more local sources for sediment delivery.","Authors":"Malkowski, MA (Malkowski, Matthew A.) ; Sharman, GR (Sharman, Glenn R.) ; Graham, SA (Graham, Stephan A.) ; Fildani, A (Fildani, Andrea)","Title":"Characterisation and diachronous initiation of coarse clastic deposition in the Magallanes-Austral foreland basin, Patagonian Andes"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:News Item Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000393677600002 ISSN: 0043-1656 eISSN: 1477-8696","Categories":"Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences Web of Science Categories:Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences","Journal Information":"WEATHER Volume: 72 Issue: 1 Pages: 2-2 Published: JAN 2017","Authors":"[Anonymous]","Title":"New Bureau operations hub for north-western Australia opens in Darwin"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000393302300002 ISSN: 1860-0743","Keywords":"acorn barnacle; Cirripedia; Balanomorpha; shell morphology; opercular valve; distribution; Thailand KeyWords Plus:TETRACLITA-SQUAMOSA; WESTERN PACIFIC; GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION; CHTHAMALUS-MALAYENSIS; EURAPHIA-DEPRESSA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; THORACICA; CRUSTACEA; CHECKLIST; ASIA","Categories":"Zoology Web of Science Categories:Zoology","Journal Information":"ZOOSYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION Volume: 93 Issue: 1 Pages: 13-34 DOI: 10.3897/zse.93.10769 Published: 2017","Abstract":"The acorn barnacle is a sessile crustacean, inhabiting the intertidal areas of tropical and temperate regions worldwide.

Interestingly, acorn barnacles along the Andaman Sea occur abundantly, and are much higher in number of species (up to 8 species) than those found in the Gulf of Thailand's coast (up to 6 species). This biased trend of species' preferences is possibly due to the differences in oceanographic nature between two coastlines and the history of barnacle colonization.","Authors":"Pochai, A (Pochai, Ashitapol) ; Kingtong, S (Kingtong, Sutin) ; Sukparangsi, W (Sukparangsi, Woranop) ; Khachonpisitsak, S (Khachonpisitsak, Salinee)","Title":"The diversity of acorn barnacles (Cirripedia, Balanomorpha) across Thailand's coasts: The Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000392415700006 ISSN: 0899-8418 eISSN: 1097-0088","Keywords":"Australian monsoon; Dunion NT sounding; radiosonde sounding; tropical cyclone intensification; Willis Island KeyWords Plus:TROPICAL CYCLONES; PART I; INTENSITY; MODEL; ATLANTIC; VORTEX","Categories":"Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences Web of Science Categories:Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences","Journal Information":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY Volume: 37 Issue: 1 Pages: 66-78 DOI: 10.1002/joc.4687 Published: JAN 2017","Abstract":"Motivated in part by a potential application to modelling tropical cyclones in the Australian region, mean radiosonde soundings are determined for the three northern Australian stations, Willis Island, Darwin and Weipa, during the core months of the cyclone season (December-February). More than 8500 individual soundings are examined in 30-year datasets for Willis Island and Darwin (1980-2010) and a 15-year dataset for Weipa (1998-2013). These soundings are stratified into three groups according to the low-level wind direction (monsoon regime, easterly flow regime and the rest). The mean soundings for the monsoon regime (low-level winds in the sector west to north) are compared at the three stations and diurnal differences are investigated at stations with two soundings per day. The mean monsoon Willis Island sounding is compared also with the Dunion moist tropical (MT) sounding, which is frequently used as an environmental sounding in the numerical modelling of tropical cyclones. The Willis Island sounding is 1-3 degrees C warmer and somewhat drier than the Dunion MT sounding through the entire troposphere, although the relative humidity differences are relatively small (less than 5% at most observed levels). Idealized numerical simulations of tropical cyclone evolution are performed to assess the implications of using one thermodynamic sounding or another for tropical cyclones in the Australian region. The simulations highlight the importance of not only the environmental sounding for the intensification of model storms, but also the sea surface temperature combined with the sounding.","Authors":"Crnivec, N (Crnivec, Nina) ; Smith, RK (Smith, Roger K.)","Title":"Mean radiosonde soundings for the Australian monsoon/cyclone season"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000391826300009 ISSN: 0739-0572 eISSN: 1520-0426","Categories":"Engineering; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Ocean; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY Volume: 34 Issue: 1 Pages: 117-136 DOI: 10.1175/JTECH-D-15-0246.1 Published: JAN 2017","Abstract":"High ice water content (IWC) regions in mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are a potential threat to commercial aviation, as they are suspected to cause in-service engine power-loss events and air data probe malfunctions. To investigate this, the high-altitude ice crystals (HAIC)/high ice water content (HIWC) projects set up a first field campaign in Darwin (Australia) in 2014. The airborne instrumentation was selected to provide the most accurate measurements of both the bulk total water content (TWC), using a specially developed isokinetic evaporator, and the individual ice crystals properties, using particle imaging probes. This study focuses on determining the size ranges of ice crystals responsible for the mass in high IWC regions, defined here as cloud regions with IWC greater than 1.5 g m(-3). It is shown that for high IWC areas in most of the encountered MCSs, median mass diameters (MMDs) of ice crystals range from 250 to 500 mu m and decrease with increasing TWC and decreasing temperature. At the same time, the mass contribution of the smallest crystals (below 100 mm) remains generally low (below 15%). In contrast, data from two flight missions in a long-lasting quasi-stationary tropical storm reveal that high IWC values can also be associated with MMDs in the range 400-800 mu m and peak values of up to 2 mm. Ice crystal images suggest a major growth contribution by vapor deposition (columns, capped columns) even for such larger MMD values.","Authors":"Leroy, D (Leroy, D.) ; Fontaine, E (Fontaine, E.) ; Schwarzenboeck, A (Schwarzenboeck, A.) ; Strapp, JW (Strapp, J.

The wave pattern resembles the east Atlantic-west Russia pattern and influences the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) region. A tripole pattern between the West Siberian Plain and the two centers of action of ENSO indicates that the background state of ENSO with respect to global sea level pressure (SLP) has a significant negative correlation to the West Siberian Plain. The correlation with the background state, which is defined by the sum of the two centers of action of ENSO, is higher than each of the pairwise correlations with either of the ENSO centers alone. The centers are defined with a clustering algorithm that detects regions with similar characteristics. The normalized monthly SLP time series for the two centers of ENSO (around Darwin, Australia, and Tahiti) are area averaged, and the sum of both regions is considered as the background state of ENSO. This wave train can be detected throughout the troposphere and the lower stratosphere. Its origins can be traced back to Rossby wave activity triggered by convection over the subtropical North Atlantic that emanates wave activity toward the West Siberian Plain. The same wave train also propagates to the central Pacific Ocean around Tahiti and can be used to predict the background state over the ENSO region. This background state also modifies the subtropical bridge between tropical eastern Pacific and subtropical North Atlantic leading to a circumglobal wave train.","Authors":"Liess, S (Liess, Stefan) ; Agrawal, S (Agrawal, Saurabh) ; Chatterjee, S (Chatterjee, Snigdhansu) ; Kumar, V (Kumar, Vipin) Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number Liess, Stefan  http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3544-8505","Title":"A Teleconnection between the West Siberian Plain and the ENSO Region"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000392154200013 PubMed ID: 27811301 ISSN: 0022-0949 eISSN: 1477-9145","Keywords":"Antimicrobial; Fouling; Confocal; Attachment; Bacteria; Reactive oxygen species KeyWords Plus:TYROSINASE-CATALYZED OXIDATION; INSECT CUTICLE SCLEROTIZATION; AMPHITRITE AMPHITRITE DARWIN; MARINE INVERTEBRATE LARVAE; BALANUS-AMPHITRITE; REACTIVE OXYGEN; CROSS-LINKING; GREGARIOUS SETTLEMENT; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX; SHELL MINERALIZATION","Categories":"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:Biology","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY Volume: 220 Issue: 2 Pages: 194-207 DOI: 10.1242/jeb.145094 Published: JAN 2017","Abstract":"Mobile barnacle cypris larvae settle and metamorphose, transitioning to sessile juveniles with morphology and growth similar to that of adults. Because biofilms exist on immersed surfaces on which they attach, barnacles must interact with bacteria during initial attachment and subsequent growth. The objective of this study was to characterize the developing interface of the barnacle and substratum during this key developmental transition to inform potential mechanisms that promote attachment. The interface was characterized using confocal microscopy and fluorescent dyes to identify morphological and chemical changes to the interface and the status of bacteria present as a function of barnacle developmental stage. Staining revealed patchy material containing proteins and nucleic acids, reactive oxygen species amidst developing cuticle, and changes in bacteria viability at the developing interface. We found that as barnacles metamorphose from the cyprid to juvenile stage, proteinaceous materials with the appearance of coagulated liquid were released into and remained at the interface. It stained positive for proteins, including phosphoprotein, as well as nucleic acids. Regions of the developing cuticle and the patchy material itself stained for reactive oxygen species. Bacteria were absent until the cyprid was firmly attached, but populations died as barnacle development progressed. The oxidative environment may contribute to the cytotoxicity observed for bacteria and has the potential for oxidative crosslinking of cuticle and proteinaceous materials at the interface.","Authors":"Essock-Burns, T (Essock-Burns, Tara) ; Gohad, NV (Gohad, Neeraj V.) ; Orihuela, B (Orihuela, Beatriz) ; Mount, AS (Mount, Andrew S.) ; Spillmann, CM (Spillmann, Christopher M.) ; Wahl, KJ (Wahl, Kathryn J.) ; Rittschof, D (Rittschof, Daniel) Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number Wahl, Kathryn  http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8163-6964","Title":"Barnacle biology before, during and after settlement and metamorphosis: a study of the interface"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Editorial Material Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000392041700001 PubMed ID: 27908673 ISSN: 0168-9525","Categories":"Genetics & Heredity Web of Science Categories:Genetics & Heredity","Journal Information":"TRENDS IN GENETICS Volume: 33 Issue: 1 Pages: 1-2 DOI: 10.1016/j.tig.2016.11.005 Published: JAN 2017","Abstract":"What might be the benefits of whole-genome rather than whole-exome sequencing (WES) for identifying the genetic causes of human disabilities?

The regenerative capacity of neurons differs profoundly between animal lineages and within the mammalian central and peripheral nervous systems. Here, we discuss research that suggests that genetic background contributes to the ability of injured axons to regenerate in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), by controlling the regulation of specific signaling cascades. We detail the methods used to identify these pathways, which include among others Activin signaling and other TGF-beta superfamily members. We discuss the potential of altering these pathways in patients with CNS damage and outline strategies to promote regeneration and repair by combinatorial manipulation of neuron-intrinsic and extrinsic determinants.

Higher densities of these barnacles lived on lower shores, while larger barnacles lived on upper shores. Settlement (involving larval supply and larval choice), rather than post-settlement mortality, has already been found to determine abundance and distribution of these gregarious barnacles, while longevity governs the size of larger barnacles. In this study, it was hypothesised that reproductive output would also influence the demography of Chamaesipho. Three models were proposed, and appropriate hypotheses tested experimentally, to explain the relationships between numbers, and size of adults, and reproductive output, and their influence on future populations of barnacles. Results demonstrated that larger barnacles had a greater reproductive output than smaller barnacles.

In benthic systems, however, early life history processes are key determinants of assemblage structure and functioning. This study tested whether the presence of an invasive species affected early life history processes of two common barnacle species and whether this was affected by a second common stressor, nutrient enrichment. The results of a field experiment identified and characterised the effects of an invasive oyster, Crassostrea gigas, on the early life history processes of the two barnacle species under ambient and enriched nutrient conditions. In the presence C. gigas, the invasive barnacle Austrominius modestus, had a lower recruitment rate, however, there was no effect of the presence of C. gigas on native barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides, recruitment. Nutrient enrichment also reduced the recruitment rate of A. modestus, however, there was no evidence of synergistic or antagonistic interactions between these stressors, indicating their cumulative effects were additive. There was no effect of nutrient enrichment on native barnacle recruitment. Our results show that the presence of an invasive oyster and nutrient enrichment altered the recruitment of another non-native benthic species. These findings emphasise the importance of considering early life history processes when assessing effects of multiple stressors on communities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To improve the robustness of this gait analysis, in this study is presented a novel real-time gait events detector, which considers the previous walking conditions. This turns this strategy advantageous regarding the state-of-the-art since this tool is easily adapted to current locomotion mode. Therefore, a finite state machine (FSM) is developed, which performs the detection of heel-strike and toe-off events through pre-defined decision rules. The proposed algorithm is innovative since it uses adaptive thresholds in the FSM's decision rules, becoming the detector robust to sporadic perturbations, and adaptive to locomotion mode changes. Three stages were considered: thresholds' calibration, real-time detection of gait events, and thresholds' update. As the first step, the algorithm was validated in a simulated and real DARwIn-OP robot. Results with two distinct controllers for generating DARwIn-OP walking show that the proposed algorithm correctly detects the gait events ( accuracy higher than 97% and 84.348% in simulated and real environments, respectively), with a delay in detection of 28-34ms. These findings support the robustness of the developed tool in real-time assistance, due its accurate validation under distinct walking conditions.","Authors":"Figueiredo, J (Figueiredo, Joana) ; Santos, CP (Santos, Cristina P.) ; Moreno, JC (Moreno, Juan C.)

Central America, arguably the best studied place where subduction erosion has been documented, is used here to assess past rates and modes of forearc recycling. Drilling from Guatemala to Costa Rica indicates that subduction erosion has been active since at least the early Miocene. Drilling also shows that the rates of subduction erosion have varied significantly both along strike and through time. The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 334 to southern Costa Rica documents unprecedented subduction erosion there - at rates larger than the fastest known rates of forearc accretion. In southern Costa Rica, accelerated subduction erosion of the upper plate initiated when the Panama Fracture Zone/Cocos Ridge, the latter being an over thickened aseismic ridge, arrived at the Middle America Trench. The forearc records this event with an unconformity at 2.2 +/- 0.2 Ma. The recovered shelf sequence overlying the unconformity constrains a short (<2 Myr) interval of extreme subsidence (similar to 1200 m) with a rapid pulse occurring during the first similar to 0.3 Myr. This event removed an estimated 1.2 x 10(6) km(3) of forearc material at a rate of similar to 1125 km(3)/Myr/km of trench during a time of rapid (similar to 1035 m/Myr) contemporaneous shelf sediment accumulation. Detrital apatite fission-track thermochronology on the sediments above the unconformity indicates the pattern of surficial sediment transport during this subduction erosion event. The fission track data showthat sediments fromthe extinct and exhumed volcanic arc -the Cordillera de Talamanca -were able to immediately access the growing forearc basin after the onset of the 2.2 Ma subduction erosion event. The onset of subduction of an aseismic ridge as occurred at 2.2 Ma in southern Costa Rica is a fairly common tectonic event along a subduction margin. We suggest that similar rapid pulses of subduction erosion may punctuate the evolution of many margins, contributing disproportionately to crustal recycling at subduction zones. The (poorly) preserved geologic record of paleoforearcs needs to be reassessedwith this mechanismin mind. It also implies that continental forearc material may be significantly consumed during short local bursts along a subduction margin, and furthermore, that margins abutting regions of frequent subduction of aseismic ridges, like the regions in theWestern Pacific where the Darwin Rise currently subducts, should face disproportionate pulses of future subduction erosion and forearc recycling.

This key innovation evolved independently in several angiosperm families. Subsequent studies on heterostyly in Primula contributed to the foundation of modern genetic theory and the neo-Darwinian synthesis. The established genetic model for Primula heterostyly involves a diallelic S locus comprising several genes, with rare recombination events that result in self-fertile homostyle flowers with anthers and stigma at the same height. Here we reveal the S locus supergene as a tightly linked cluster of thrum-specific genes that are absent in pins. We show that thrums are hemizygous not heterozygous for the S locus, which suggests that homostyles do not arise by recombination between S locus haplotypes as previously proposed. Duplication of a floral homeotic gene 51.7 million years (Myr) ago, followed by its neofunctionalization, created the current S locus assemblage which led to floral heteromorphy in Primula.

The robot behaviour learning in realistic environment requires the robot to be able to learn incrementally in order to adapt itself to the dynamic environment. The incremental learning system should be stable and acquire new information without corrupting previous knowledge. Probabilistic approach has become the prevalent epitome in robotic learning systems. In probabilistic learning models, such as Hidden Markov Model, estimating the optimal number of states is difficult which limits the models capabilities by limiting the number of motion patterns to be learned a priori. In this paper, we presented an approach for learning behaviour patterns through continuous observation. We have proposed a novel architecture for learning the spatio-temporal sequences using Topological Gaussian Adaptive Resonance Hidden Markov Model. The proposed model dynamically generates the graph-based structure for the observed patterns through a novel topological mapping architecture. The structure (number of states) of the probabilistic model is not fixed and is adjusted based on the topological map of the acquired motion features. The topological map consists of nodes connected with edges, where each node represents the encoded motion features to adaptively generalize the observed behaviour patterns. The model combines the self-organizing, self-stabilizing properties and time series processing features to learn the spatio-temporal sequences. To demonstrate the properties of the proposed algorithm, we have performed a set of experiments through simulation on DARwIn-OP humanoid robot.","Authors":"Dawood, F (Dawood, Farhan) ; Loo, CK (Loo, Chu Kiong) Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number Loo, Chu Kiong  F-4360-2011 http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7867-2665","Title":"Robot behaviour learning using Topological Gaussian Adaptive Resonance Hidden Markov Model"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000391080400005 ISSN: 0377-0265 eISSN: 1872-6879","Keywords":"Loop current dynamics; Mesoscale and frontal eddies; Mooring observations KeyWords Plus:EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; MOMENTUM IMBALANCE PARADOX; GULF-OF-MEXICO; EDDIES; FREQUENCY; ALTIMETRY; CYCLONES","Categories":"Geochemistry & Geophysics; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography Web of Science Categories:Geochemistry & Geophysics; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography","Journal Information":"DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS Volume: 76 Pages: 217-239 Part: B Special Issue: SI DOI: 10.1016/j.dynatmoce.2016.08.001 Published: DEC 2016","Abstract":"Three years (2008-2011) of direct current measurements from a mooring array deployed at the western Yucatan Channel (defined west of 85.6 degrees W) and along the eastern Campeche Bank captured the main characteristics of the Yucatan and Loop Currents and the eddies associated with them. The array was deployed to provide upstream conditions in support of the Loop Current Dynamics Experiment. A substantial portion (60-80%) of the variance at the mooring sections is related to horizontal shifts of the currents due to meanders and eddies. Time-frequency analysis indicates that the velocity time-series are \"event dominated\", with higher variability at low-frequencies (40-100 days or longer periods) but with a substantial contribution at higher frequencies (5-25 days periods) particularly strong from October to March. The vertical structure and time evolution of the eddy kinetic energy in a developing Campeche Bank cyclone suggest baroclinic instability dynamics are relevant for its development. Four Loop Current eddies (Cameron, Darwin, Ekman and Franklin) separated during 2008-2011. Ekman and Franklin were particularly dominated by a cyclone associated with a meander trough of the southward flowing branch of the Loop Current (Donohue et al., 2016a,b) and weaker Campeche Bank cyclones. For Cameron and Darwin, Campeche Bank cyclonic anomalies appear to be nearly as strong as the ones coming from the eastern side of the Loop Current. Eastward shifts of the Yucatan and Loop Currents observed over the sections appear to be linked to vorticity perturbations propagating from the Caribbean and precede several eddy detachments; their significance for the generation of Campeche Bank cyclones and eddy shedding remains to be determined. Time-series of Yucatan Current transport, vorticity fluctuations and Loop Current northward extension during the 3 deployment periods only depict positive correlation in two of them. Given the wide spectrum of variability, much more data are required to determine if a statistically robust relation exists among these variables. Our results clearly illustrate the complexity of the flow in this region and that it is difficult to single out a dominant mechanism that can explain all Loop Current eddy detachments.

Their interconnectedness precluded a separation between philosophy and the academic disciplines, explaining why throughout the subsequent history all the existing special sciences harboured schools of thought that reflected the influence of philosophical trends. Contemplate for example how the way in which Thomas Hobbes portrayed the \"state of nature,\" namely as a battle of everyone against everyone (bellum omni contra omnes), influenced Charles Darwin in his conception of nature as a \"struggle for existence.\" Stephen Gould even holds that natural selection essentially transposes the economic theory of Adam Smith to nature. Darwin struggled with the Enlightenment idea of progress although his theory as such does not leave any room for a purpose or goal. In all of this Gould discerns a paradox: the absence of a statement about general progress and the fossil record, crying out for \"a rationale that will place progress into the center of evolutionary theory\". Nineteenth century historicism succeeded the ideal of progress. It opened the way for unlimited change and transformation and at once highlights philosophical problems and insights already found in Greek philosophy. The all-important contribution of Plato was to realize that change always presupposes something persistent or enduring. This insight later on returned in the formulation of the law of inertia by Galileo and in the special theory of relativity by Einstein. Immanuel Kant articulated what he called the \"law of the continuity of all change\". However, it was the relationship between universality and what is individual that paved the way for the linguistic turn at the beginning of the 20th century. No science is possible of what is individual. Aristotle therefore had to introduce a universal secondary substance adjacent to his purely individual primary substance. While Plato actually stumbled upon a given law as order for things, Aristotle wrestled with the orderliness of things (such as the houseness of this house or the being a circle of this circle). Mediated by the space metaphysics of P armenides ' medieval philosophy eventually wrestled with the so-called ontic status of universals (universalia). Realistic metaphysics accepted a threefold existence of the universalia: ante rem as ideas in God's Mind, in re as their universal essential forms, and post rem as universal concepts in the mind of the human subject. By the beginning of the 1.3th century William of Ockham questioned the threefold existence of the universalia. Outside the human mind there is only a multiplicity of individual entities. Since nominalism rejected both a universal order for and a universal orderliness of things, it actually stripped reality of its laws and lawfulness, paving the way for Kant to introduce human understanding to fill this vacant position. He holds: \"Understanding creates its laws (a priori) not out of nature but prescribes them to nature.\" Whereas Ray and Linnaeus continued the idea of types in their idealistic morphology (accepting universality outside the human mind in classing plants and animals), Darwin and his followers adhere to nominalism, more recently articulated in a clear statement of Simpson: \"Organisms are not types and do not have types. \" Not even modern mathematics escaped from the problem of universalia because (according to Fraenkel et al) sets participate in the \"well-known and amply discussed classical problem of the ontological status of the universals\". Stegmfiller even relates this problem to basic issues in mathematics as such the three ontological positions, namely nominalism, conceptualism and platonism could be mapped upon \"the quantitative categories finite totality (Gesamtheit) denumerable infinite totality non-denumerable infinite totality\". Paul Bernays holds that the application of platonism in mathematics is so widespread that it is not an exaggeration to say that platonism reigns supreme in the field of mathematics. The remarkable and at once astonishing effect of the influence of the contest about universals in the modern natural sciences is that there is an abyss between nominalistic Darwinism and platonistic mathematics. All-in-all it is clear that the natural sciences were (and still are) thoroughly influenced by the humanities.","Authors":"Strauss, D (Strauss, Danie)","Title":"The humanities background of the natural sciences"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000390629600010 ISSN: 0006-3207 eISSN: 1873-2917","Keywords":"Phylogenetic diversity; Phylogenetic endemism; Gekkonidae; Scincidae; Distribution models; Conservation assessment KeyWords Plus:PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY; INFORM CONSERVATION; NORTHERN-TERRITORY; MONSOONAL TROPICS; DIPLODACTYLIDAE; DIVERSIFICATION; BIODIVERSITY; BIOGEOGRAPHY; ENDEMISM; GECKO","Categories":"Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology Web of Science Categories:Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Environmental Sciences","Journal Information":"BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION Volume: 204 Pages: 83-93 Part: A Special Issue: SI DOI: 10.1016/j.biocon.2016.05.002 Published: DEC 2016","Abstract":"Australia's lizard fauna is among the most diverse in the world. Yet for the continent's vast northern Monsoonal Tropics, recent genomic and morphological evidence indicate that current taxonomy significantly underestimates actual biological diversity. Apparently widespread species typically contain ancient phylogenetic divisions or confounded taxonomic boundaries. Resolving the distributions and relationships across tropical species complexes reveals higher diversity than is recognised taxonomically and may warrant substantial taxonomic changes. For conservation assessments however, we need not wait for revised taxonomy, because phylogenetically informed analyses can use the best available data to inform conservation priorities now, independent of taxonomy. We present results of a large-scale conservation analysis based on comparative phylogeography of ten genera of lizards in two families (Gekkonidae and Scincidae) across the \"Top End\" of northern Australia, an ecologically and topographically diverse landscape recognised for its high biodiversity and indigenous cultural values. We combine the distributions and phylogeny of evolutionary lineages across multiple species complexes to estimate phylogenetic endemism, a measure of the extent to which evolutionary diversity is geographically concentrated. We demonstrate new methods for conservation assessment to incorporate phylogenetic diversity both within and across species, and for cases where taxonomy is uncertain or incomplete. We identify five hotspots of endemism, some previously known such as the Arnhem Plateau but others that are newly identified such as the Wessel & English Company Islands and the Darwin-Litchfield area. We find that, weighted by range size, the 28% of the region within protected areas holds 44% of the region's sampled phylogenetic diversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The seasonal progression of the wet season is similar across the region, with steadily increasing atmospheric moisture and rainfall into the core months of the monsoon, January and February, decreasing into March. This seasonal progression differs in the eastern domain, where there is an extension of premonsoonal conditions into December, and a delay of the onset of the monsoon until January. An analysis of TRMM precipitation features (PFs) reveals more intense convection during the premonsoon, steadily decreasing in intensity to much shallower convection by March, with a steady increase in the overall number of PFs throughout the wet season. Regionally, the intensity of PFs steadily decreases eastward across northern Australia with significantly weaker, shallower PFs over the eastern domain. Intraseasonal variability associated with the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) has a consistent impact on the rainfall and the total number of TRMM PFs across northern Australia, with both increasing and decreasing during the active and suppressed phases, respectively. However, regional variations in the effect of the MJO lead to radically different characteristics of PFs during the suppressed phases; intense convection and thunderstorms become more frequent over the western and central domains, while shallow PFs associated with the warm rain precipitation process increase in number over the eastern domain.","Authors":"Murphy, MJ (Murphy, Michael J., Jr.) ; Siems, ST (Siems, Steven T.) ; Manton, MJ (Manton, Michael J.)","Title":"Regional Variation in the Wet Season of Northern Australia"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000390095200008 ISSN: 0011-3204 eISSN: 1537-5382","Categories":"Anthropology Web of Science Categories:Anthropology","Journal Information":"CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume: 57 Issue: 6 Pages: 838-843 DOI: 10.1086/688885 Published: DEC 2016","Abstract":"Sigmund Freud developed his evolutionary theory for the origin of the Oedipus complex in Totem and Taboo, published in 1913. This complex scenario, involving what Freud called the primal crime and its subsequent phylogenetic consequences, incorporated theories from a number of sources, including Charles Darwin. Freud claimed to have found in Darwin a proposal for the structure for early human social organization. Since then, Darwin's primal horde has endured in a variety of literatures that build on Freud's work. In this essay, Darwin's primal horde is reevaluated from the standpoint of Darwin's writing. Darwin's words were taken out of context and exaggerated. The primal horde is a concept that Darwin would not recognize, that he did not propose, and that misrepresents what he wrote. It is Freud's construction, not Darwin's. Modern authors should not cite Darwin when discussing Darwin's primal horde.","Authors":"Smith, RJ (Smith, Richard J.)","Title":"Darwin, Freud, and the Continuing Misrepresentation of the Primal Horde"}]
