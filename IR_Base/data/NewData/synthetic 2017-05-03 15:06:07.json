One strategy to sustain the groundwater supply is to recharge aquifers artificially with reclaimed water or storm-water via managed aquifer recharge and recovery (MAR) systems. Unfortunately, MAR systems remain wrought with operational challenges related to the quality and quantity of recharged and recovered water stemming from a lack of data-driven, real-time control. This paper presents a laboratory scale proof-of-concept study that demonstrates the capability of a real-time, simulation-based control optimization algorithm to ease the operational challenges of MAR systems. Central to the algorithm is a model that simulates water flow and transport of dissolved chemical constituents in the aquifer. The algorithm compensates for model parameter uncertainty by continually collecting data from a network of sensors embedded within the aquifer. At regular intervals the sensor data is fed into an inversion algorithm, which calibrates the uncertain parameters and generates the initial conditions required to model the system behavior. The calibrated model is then incorporated into a genetic algorithm that executes simulations and determines the best management action, for example, the optimal pumping policy for current aquifer management goals. Experiments to calibrate and validate the simulation-optimization algorithm were conducted in a small two-dimensional synthetic aquifer under both homogeneous and heterogeneous packing configurations. Results from initial experiments validated the feasibility of the approach and suggested that our system could improve the operation of full-scale MAR facilities.","Authors":"Drumheller, Z (Drumheller, Zachary) ; Smits, KM (Smits, Kathleen M.) ; Illangasekare, TH (Illangasekare, Tissa H.) ; Regnery, J (Regnery, Julia) ; Lee, J (Lee, Jonghyun) ; Kitanidis, PK (Kitanidis, Peter K.)","Title":"Optimal Decision Making Algorithm for Managed Aquifer Recharge and Recovery Operation Using Near Real-Time Data: Benchtop Scale Laboratory Demonstration"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396490200014 ISSN: 1735-0328 eISSN: 1726-6890","Keywords":"Celecoxib; Anti-inflammatory agent; Ionic liquid; Trifluoroacetone; 4-methylbenzoylchloride; 4-hydrazinobenzenesulfonamide hydrochloride KeyWords Plus:HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; COX-2 INHIBITORS; CELECOXIB; EXPRESSION; CYCLOOXYGENASE-2; ANALOGS; DRUGS","Categories":"Pharmacology & Pharmacy Web of Science Categories:Pharmacology & Pharmacy","Journal Information":"IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH Volume: 16 Issue: 1 Pages: 158-164 Published: WIN 2017","Abstract":"Celecoxib is classified as none traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This compound has conventional properties of NSAIDs such as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities beside reduced risk of gastrointestinal side effect of traditional NSAIDs such as ibuprofen. This compound gets a second sale rank of NSAIDs market at 2016 in the world and sales more than 17000 Kg in Iran during the past 6 month. So, a simple, rapid and green method for synthesis of this compound is important. In the present study, a novel green method was suggested for the synthesis of celecoxib using the ionic liquid. Celecoxib was provided by the reaction of trifluoroacetone, 4-methylbenzoylchloride, and 4-hydrazinobenzenesulfonamide hydrochloride. The tris-(2-hydroxyethyl) ammonium acetate as ionic liquid was prepared by mixing tris-(2-hydroxyethyl) ammonium and acetic acid, and used as an efficient catalyst. The structure of the synthetic products was confirmed by analytical and spectroscopic methods including (HNMR)-H-1, (CNMR)-C-13, IR, MS and elemental analysis. This ionic liquid can play dual roles in the synthesis of celecoxib, as a catalyst to improve electrophilicity of carbonyl group and also as a solvent of reaction. The reaction rate and yield (86%) were improved considerably. Moreover IL showed the same efficiency when used in 4 consecutive reactions.","Authors":"Ahfad-Hosseini, HR (Ahfad-Hosseini, Hamid Reza) ; Bagheri, H (Bagheri, Hasan) ; Amidi, S (Amidi, Salimeh)","Title":"Ionic Liquid-assisted Synthesis of Celexocib Using Tris-(2-hydroxyethyl) Ammonium Acetate as an Efficient and Reusable Catalyst"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396490200037 ISSN: 1735-0328 eISSN: 1726-6890","Keywords":"Aromatherapy; Lavender; Vital Sings; Open-heart surgery KeyWords Plus:AROMATHERAPY; MOOD","Categories":"Pharmacology & Pharmacy Web of Science Categories:Pharmacology & Pharmacy","Journal Information":"IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH Volume: 16 Issue: 1 Pages: 404-409 Published: WIN 2017","Abstract":"This study evaluated the effects of inhalation of Lavender essential oil on vital signs in open heart surgery ICU. The main complaint of patients after open-heart surgery is dysrhythmia, tachycardia, and hypertension due to stress and pain. Due to the side effects of chemical drugs, such as opioids, use of non-invasive methods such as aromatherapy for relieving stress and pain parallel to chemical agents could be an important way to decrease the dose and side effects of analgesics. In a multicenter, single-blind trial, 40 patients who had open-heart surgery were recruited. Inclusion criteria were full consciousness, lack of hemorrhage, heart rate >60 beats/min, systolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure > 60 mmHg, not using beta blockers in the operating room or ICU, no history of addiction to opioids or use of analgesics in regular, spontaneous breathing ability and not receiving synthetic opioids within 2 h before extubation. Ten minutes after extubation, the patients > vital signs [including BP, HR, Central Venous Pressure (CVP), SPO2, and RR] were measured. Then, a cotton swab, which was impregnated with 2 drops of Lavender essential oil 2%, was placed in patients' oxygen mask and patients breathed for 10 min. Thirty minutes after aromatherapy, the vital signs were measured again. Main objective of this study was the change in vital sign before and after aromatherapy. Statistical significance was accepted for P < 0.05. There was a significant difference in systolic blood pressure (p 0.001 <), diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.001), and heart rate (p = 0.03) before and after the intervention using paired t-test. Although, the results did not show any significant difference in respiratory rate (p = 0.1), SpO2 (p = 0.5) and CVP (p = 0.2) before and after inhaling Lavender essential oil. Therefore, the aromatherapy could effectively reduce blood pressure and heart rate in patients admitted to the open heart surgery ICU and can be used as an independent nursing intervention in stabilizing mentioned vital signs. The limitations of our study were sample size and lack of control group. Randomized clinical trials with larger sample size are recommended.","Authors":"Salamati, A (Salamati, Armaiti) ; Mashouf, S (Mashouf, Soheyla) ; Mojab, F (Mojab, Faraz)","Title":"Effect of Inhalation of Lavender Essential Oil on Vital Signs in Open Heart Surgery ICU"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395035400002 ISSN: 1096-7494 eISSN: 1559-3169","Categories":"Public Administration Web of Science Categories:Public Administration","Journal Information":"INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL Volume: 20 Issue: 1 Pages: 7-13 DOI: 10.1080/10967494.2016.1169066 Published: NOV 1 2017","Abstract":"The field of public management is methodologically underdeveloped as compared to other disciplines.

The synthetic control method for comparative case studies (SCM) has great potential for advancing public management scholarship by addressing some of the methodological challenges associated with observational data and providing intuitive graphical results that help researchers communicate their findings to audiences unfamiliar with quantitative methods. SCM uses a transparent, data-driven algorithm for selecting a weighted combination of control units that act as a plausible counterfactual for estimating causal effects. This article demonstrates SCM by investigating the effect of enhancing managerial discretion under performance accountability systems in the context of public education. The article also provides a number of possible avenues for future public management research using SCM and practical guidance for applying the method.","Authors":"Birdsall, C (Birdsall, Chris)","Title":"THE SYNTHETIC CONTROL METHOD FOR COMPARATIVE CASE STUDIES: AN APPLICATION ESTIMATING THE EFFECT OF MANAGERIAL DISCRETION UNDER PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395033100016 ISSN: 0003-2719 eISSN: 1532-236X","Keywords":"Biopolymers; immobilization; tissue cell culture; tissue engineering; viability KeyWords Plus:TISSUE ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS; IN-VITRO BIOCOMPATIBILITY; SURFACE MODIFICATION; COMPOSITE SCAFFOLDS; CANCER CELLS; STEM-CELLS; IMMOBILIZATION; FIBROBLASTS; MEMBRANE; VIVO","Categories":"Chemistry Web of Science Categories:Chemistry, Analytical","Journal Information":"ANALYTICAL LETTERS Volume: 50 Issue: 1 Pages: 219-232 DOI: 10.1080/00032719.2016.1163363 Published: NOV 1 2017","Abstract":"Lung transplantation is a necessary step for the patients with the end stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The use of artificial lungs is a promising alternative to natural lung transplantation which is complicated and is restricted by low organ donations. For successful lung engineering, it is important to choose the correct combination of specific biological cells and a synthetic carrier polymer. The focus of this study was to investigate the interactions of human lung epithelial cell line NCl-H292 that is involved in lung tissue development with the biodegradable poly(epsilon-caprolactone) before and after its chemical modification to evaluate potential for use in artificial lung formation. Also, the effect of polymer chemical modification on its mechanical and surface properties has been investigated. The poly(epsilon-caprolactone) surface was modified using aminolysis followed by immobilization of gelatin. The unmodified and modified polymer surfaces were characterized for roughness, tensile strength, and NCl-H292 metabolic cell activity. The results showed for the first time the possibility for NCI-H292 cells to adhere on this polymeric material. The resazurin assay showed that the metabolic activity at 24h postseeding of 80% in the presence of the unmodified and greater than 100% in the presence of the modified polymer was observed. The roughness of the poly(epsilon-caprolactone) increased from 4 to 26nm and the film strength increased from 0.01 to 0.045 kN when the material was chemically modified. The results obtained to date show potential for using modified poly(epsilon-caprolactone) as a scaffold for lung tissue engineering.","Authors":"Kosmala, A (Kosmala, Aleksandra) ; Fitzgerald, M (Fitzgerald, Michelle) ; Moore, E (Moore, Eric) ; Stam, F (Stam, Frank)","Title":"Evaluation of a Gelatin-Modified Poly(epsilon-Caprolactone) Film as a Scaffold for Lung Disease"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397379000007 ISSN: 0020-0255 eISSN: 1872-6291","Keywords":"Dependent judgment analysis; Crowdsourcing; Majority voting; Markov chain","Categories":"Computer Science Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Information Systems","Journal Information":"INFORMATION SCIENCES Volume: 396 Pages: 83-96 DOI: 10.1016/j.ins.2017.01.036 Published: AUG 2017","Abstract":"Annotation of large-scale datasets can promisingly be done by crowd workers in a time and cost effective way. A major challenge in this area is how we aggregate the opinions received from multiple workers to derive the final judgment. Most of the crowd opinion aggregation models known so far deal with independent opinions, where the crowd workers provide their opinions unanimously and these are not visible to everyone. In real life, there are applications where an annotator can see others' opinions. This incurs a higher chance of getting biased by the other opinions. This paper addresses a new problem, hereafter termed as dependent judgment analysis, and proposes a method to derive the final judgment from a given set of independent and dependent opinions. Here, a Markov chain based aggregation method is used to handle the opinions of the crowd workers for finding a consensus. We study the performance of the proposed method on a synthetic dataset and another real-life dataset published in recent times. The proposed method is applied on these two datasets to find out the aggregated judgment. The efficacy of our proposed method is shown by comparing it with majority voting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Co-location pattern alining is a valid method for identifying patterns whose instances are prevalent in geographical proximity. However, existing methods treat the space as homogeneous and non-directional, and both the proximity levels and connecting directions of instances are neglected during the mining process, causing the minded patterns to be unsatisfactory. Tobler's First Law indicates that the contributions of instances to their pattern's significance diminish as the distance decreases. Moreover, the directions in which instances are connected should also be considered due to the distance decay effects. Following these threads, this paper proposes a novel co-location pattern mining algorithm mixed with a density-weighted distance thresholding consideration. Based on the framework of our previous SGCT algorithm, which concentrates on efficiency and storage issues, this solution comprises an extension called SGCT-K, which is mainly concerned with improving the effectiveness of the mined results. It adopts a kernel-density-estimation-based model to measure the proximity level of different instance types and respects their directions during the instance connecting process. We implement experiments using both synthetic and real-facility datasets in Beijing, China. The results provide sound evidence that the algorithm improves both accuracy and sensitivity compared to previous methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Accordingly, the link prediction problem is formulated as a machine learning process with latent variables; therefore, an Expectation Maximization (EM, for short) algorithm is adopted and further developed to cope with the estimation problem. The performance of the present method is tested both on synthetic networks and on real-world datasets from social media networks and collaboration networks.

In this work, experimental ratifications to this assumption were found for both crude oils and nonpolar asphaltene mixtures. This is an important matter since the oil compatibility is estimated from this assumption. Models based on the Regular Solution and Flory-Huggins theories were used to estimate the solubility data of least-soluble asphaltenes. Thereby, it was observed that the employment of Kikic modification of the Flory-Huggins combinatorial term plus the replacement of the traditional Hildebrand solubility parameter by the Hansen solubility parameter in the energetic term greatly improved the performance of these models and led to the best correlation, even for polar and associative solvents. In addition, the impact of asphaltene blending on Brazilian oil stability was evaluated from two asphaltene fractions sequentially extracted. The results point out that the asphaltene subfractionation should be taken into account in the solubility modeling. From these results, a critical solubility parameter for Brazilian oils (16.8 MPa1/2) is proposed to be used as a universal input parameter in the experimental methodology of predicting solubility parameter of crude oils based on asphaltene stability. The predicted solubility parameter was fully compatible with the calculations from three empirical models that also correlate this property with other experimental data of crude oils.

First, we show how the stability of individual objects can be estimated based on repeated runs of the K-means and K-medoids algorithms. The quality of the resulting clusterings, expressed by the popular Calinski-Harabasz, Silhouette, Dunn and Davies-Bouldin cluster validity indices, is taken into account when computing the stability estimates of individual objects. Second, we explain how to assess the stability of individual clusters of objects and sets of clusters that are found by partitioning algorithms. Finally, we present a new and effective stability-based algorithm that improves the ability of traditional partitioning methods to determine the number of clusters in datasets. We compare our algorithm to some well-known cluster identification techniques, including X-means, Pvclust, Adegenet, Prediction Strength and Nselectboot.

In addition, following the deposition of a paramagnetic Ni layer between the Au and TiO2 layers, the micromotor can be precisely navigated under an external magnetic field. Such magnetic micromotors not only facilitate the recycling of micromotors, but also allow reusability in the context of dye detection and degradation.

In this scenario, it arises an interesting and challenging problem: how to identify the same person in different social networks, which is known as the network reconciliation problem. Prior work on this problem first assumes that the relationships between users are homogeneous, and then makes use of the local features (degree, common mapped neighbors) to achieve high precision. However, this assumption does not hold in reality since users usually have different tie strengths between each other. In this paper, we remodel the reconciliation problem by considering the users' heterogeneous relationships and propose a unified framework called UniRank for incorporating the local features and global features together. Based on UniRank, we design an efficient two-stage network reconciliation algorithm. First, we design a global matching algorithm to explore more seeds with fast speed. Second, for each explored seed, we design a breadth-first strategy based local matching algorithm to match more seeds. Extensive simulations on real-world and synthetic social network datasets show that our algorithm significantly improves the state-of-art algorithm by up to 9X in terms of F-1 score even under very rough conditions.

Therefore, development of new methods for early diagnosis is instantly required. Biological recognition probes such as synthetic receptor and aptamer is one of the candidate recognition layers to detect important biomolecules. In this work, an electrochemical aptasensor was developed by fabricating an aptamer-cell-aptamer sandwich architecture on an SBA-15-3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (SBA-15-pr-NH2) and Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified graphite screen printed electrode (GSPE) surface for the selective, label-free detection of CT26 cancer cells. Based on the incubation of the thiolated aptamer with CT26 cells, the electron-transfer resistance of Fe (CN)(6)(3-/4-) redox couple increased considerably on the aptasensor surface. The results obtained from cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies showed that the fabricated aptasensor can specifically identify CT26 cells in the concentration ranges of 10-1.0x10(5) cells/mL and 1.0x10(5)-6.0x10(6) cells/mL, respectively, with a detection limit of 2 cells/mL. Applying the thiol terminated aptamer (5TR1) as a recognition layer led to a sensor with high affinity for CT26 cancer cells, compared to control cancer cells of AGS cells, VERO Cells, PC3 cells and SKOV-3 cells. Therefore a simple, rapid, label free, inexpensive, excellent, sensitive and selective electrochemical aptasensor based on sandwich architecture was developed for detection of CT26 Cells.","Authors":"Hashkavayi, AB (Hashkavayi, Ayemeh Bagheri) ; Raoof, JB (Raoof, Jahan Bakhsh) ; Ojani, R (Ojani, Reza) ; Kavoosian, S (Kavoosian, Saeid)","Title":"Ultrasensitive electrochemical aptasensor based on sandwich architecture for selective label-free detection of colorectal cancer (CT26) cells"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395955900022 PubMed ID: 28193412 ISSN: 0308-8146 eISSN: 1873-7072","Keywords":"Lepteridine; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Manuka honey; Leptospermum honey; Honey authentication KeyWords Plus:LEPTOSPERMUM-SCOPARIUM HONEY; NEW-ZEALAND HONEYS; SPECTROSCOPY; ORIGIN","Categories":"Chemistry; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics Web of Science Categories:Chemistry, Applied; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics","Journal Information":"FOOD CHEMISTRY Volume: 225 Pages: 175-180 DOI: 10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.12.099 Published: JUN 15 2017","Abstract":"The recent discovery of two unique manuka marker fluorescence wavelengths (MM1 and MM2) potentially offers a rapid and cost-effective approach for manuka honey authentication using spectroscopy.

We quantified the lepteridine in manuka honey and manuka nectar, which ranged between 5-52 mg/kg and 80-205 mg/kg, respectively. Notably, the fluorescent spectrum of synthetic lepteridine matched the MM2 fluorescence signature. Fluorescence quenching was observed in the honey matrix but otherwise, lepteridine was stable over prolonged storage at 37 degrees C. Lepteridine was also found in Australian Leptospermum honeys and nectars. Lepteridine concentration was positively correlated with concentrations of the MM1 fluorescence marker leptosperin in honeys.

The composite was found to be microporous and with pronounced affinity towards gaseous CO2 (heat of adsorption of similar to 45 kJ/mot at initial coverage). The composite was characterized through several techniques including gas sorption, FTIR spectroscopy, SEM, AFM, and TEM microscopy, elemental analysis and thermogravimetric (TGA) analyses. The hdmogenous coating of the POP on top of the MWCNTs was evident from its electron microscopy images. Quantum mechanical calculations for geometry optimization of a fragment of the polymer and of the composite indicated rigidified structure of the POP in contact with the MWCNTs, further supporting and explaining the findings from the gas sorption measurements conducted herein. In Addition, the composite was found to be electrochemically active towards CO2 reduction, surpassing the properties of either of its two components, indicating enhanced interfacial interactions between the MWCNTs and the POP. Moreover, the catalytic behavior of the composite was straightforwardly enhanced through post-synthetic incipient wetness impregnation of Cu(I) ions, demonstrating tunnability of the catalyst.

Phenol-resorcinol-formaldehyde foams (PRFFs) were prepared with synthetic PRFRs. The results showed that PRFR-2 exhibited higher reactivity, faster curing speed, and better thermal stability. In addition, the foam produced with the PRFR-2 had improved mechanical and flame retardation properties and a compressive strength of 0.18 MPa, a flexural strength of 0.25 MPa, and a limited oxygen index (LOI) greater than 37%. The increased reactivity of the PRFRs correlated with the changing mechanical properties of PRFFs because of the effects of resorcinol and the molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol and resorcinol.

However, investigations into doping and compositing of tubular graphene are still at an early stage. Herein, the first large-scale synthesis of N-doped graphene nanotubes (GNTs) and the N-doped graphene coaxial nanotubes with amorphous SiO2 coating layer (GNTs@SiO2) have been performed in a facile free-template, one-step chemical vapor deposition method, and the growth mechanism was investigated in detail. This approach both simplifies the synthetic process and protects the nanotubes from destruction caused by template removal. Moreover, a high ratio of graphitic-N to pyridinic-N doping (similar to 6.5: 1) was achieved, which is an important factor required to improve the various properties of graphene. The N-doped GNTs and GNTs@SiO2 displayed excellent field emission properties, with E-to of 1.2 and 0.5 V/mu m and E-thr of 3.4 and 4 V/mu m, respectively, and a synergistic effect mechanism has been proposed to interpret the enhanced FE properties. This present research not only offers a new route for large-scale synthesis of N-doped tubular graphene and its nanocomposite, along with excellent field emission properties and electroconductivity, but also establishes a foundation for their application in various fields.

From the catalytic results using these MFI zeolite nanosheets and conventional MFI zeolites, PX production yield was found to be strongly related to zeolite crystal thickness and concentration Of Bronsted acid sites of the MFI zeolite catalysts. The MFI zeolite nanosheet with small thickness provided high PX production due to the presence of Bronsted acid sites on the exterior surface and facile mass transfer of aromatic compounds through mesopores. To verify these catalytic factors and to apply it to commercially available zeolite, a mesoporous MFI zeolite was prepared from a commercial ZSM-5 zeolite via a simple post-treatment process; mesoporous MFI-type zeolites were tested in the DMF-to-PX reaction. This mesoporous MFI zeolite exhibited a superior PX yield (75.8%) with high DMF conversion and PX selectivity compared with those characteristics of pristine MFI zeolite (PX yield=8.4%).

In this work, alpha-Fe2O3 anchored to graphene oxide (GO) nanosheet (alpha-Fe2O3@GO) was synthesized through a facile hydrolysis process and its photo-catalytic performances and dtlrability in heterogeneous Fenton system were fully evaluated. The decolorization rates of methylene blue in alpha-Fe2O3@GO + H2O2 + UV system within a wide pH range were approximately 2.9-fold that of classical Degussa P25 TiO2 +UV and 2.4-fold that of alpha-Fe2O3 + H2O2 + UV. This enhanced decolorization of methylene blue (MB) in alpha-Fe2O3@GO + H2O2 + UV system were attributed to the unique incorporation of GO into the catalyst which not only mediated the morphology of active sites alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticles but also offered high electron conductivity and electrostatic attraction between negatively charged GO with positively charged MB. High efficiencies of degradation were achieved on various surface charged organic pollutants (around 96-100%), such as cationic compounds of MB and rhodamine B (RhB), anionic compound Orange II (OII) and Orange G (OG), neutral compounds of phenol, 2-nitrophenol (2 -NP) and endocrine disrupting compound 17 beta-estradiol (E2). The dominant reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for decolorization, such as hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-circle) and superoxide anion radicals (O-2(circle-)) generated by activation of H2O2 on the surface of alpha-Fe2O3@GO were detected and quantified by free radical quenching methods. The possible degradation mechanism of MB involved the rupture of phenothiazine ring by desulfurization and the rupture of phenyl ring due to the attack of ROS, which was analyzed by LC/MS/MS. The reduction of MB and its intermediates was consistent with the decreasing trend of the acute toxicity towards luminous bacteria with the increasing irradiation time.

In-service condition of these materials is traditionally monitored through costly visual inspection, which adds to the operating costs of these structures. Acoustic Emissions (AE) are widely used for condition-monitoring in air, and show great potential underwater. This paper investigates the AE signatures of synthetic mooring ropes subjected to sinusoidal tension-tension loading in a controlled environment, using a large-scale dynamic tensile test rig. With a linear array of 3 broadband (20 Hz to 50 kHz) hydrophones, four main signatures are identified: low-to high frequency, low-amplitude signals (50 Hz to 10 kHz), low-amplitude broadband signals (10 kHz to 20 kHz), high amplitude signals (10 Hz to 48 kHz) and medium-amplitude signals (500 Hz to 48 kHz). These AE types are related to different stages of rope behaviour, from bedding-in to degradation and failure. The main findings are that the failure location and breaking load can be identified through the detection of AE. The occurrence of high amplitude AE bursts in relation to the applied tensile load allows the detection of an imminent failure, i.e. prior to the failure event. These initial results indicate that AE analyses can enable the integrity of synthetic mooring ropes to be monitored. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examined the potential use of quillaja saponin (Q-Naturale 200) as a natural emulsifier in model coffee creamers.

The model creamer was stable to droplet aggregation and creaming from pH 3.5 to 7.0, which was attributed to the small droplet diameter (d < 0.2 gm) and high droplet charge (zeta-potential = -20 to -50 mV). Addition of model creamer to hot black coffee (85 degrees C) at varying coffee concentrations (0.85-1.7%) and fat content (0-1.5%) produced white coffee drinks that had similar visual appearance and tristimulus color coordinates as those produced by a commercial creamer. No feathering was observed in the model white coffee systems, which indicated that the model creamer was stable after addition to hot coffee solutions. Addition of sugar (1 or 2 g) to the coffee followed by creamer addition had no effect on the stability of the white coffee drinks. Overall, the information obtained has useful implications for the use of natural emulsifiers in place of synthetic ones in food and beverage applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the future energy supply is characterized by the increase of renewable energy: sun, water, wind and biomass. Entrained flow gasification of biomass is promising, since it is a highly efficient and flexible process. Low-grade fuels are chemically transformed at high temperatures (> 1200 degrees C) and pressures (up to 80 bar) into synthetic fuels. The inorganics of the fuel are converted into a slag, which forms a layer in the reactor. The thermophysical and chemical properties of the slag are defining the conditions and limitations of the gasification process. In this study, the fundamental thermophysical properties of bioliq slags are determined, in order to describe the heat transfer and the flow of the slag across the reactor by CDF-modelling of the bioliq-gasifier within the HVIGasTech project. By using a high temperature viscometer the viscosity and flow behavior of the slag were determined. In addition, the density and surface tension were measured by the sessile drop method. Thermometric and calorimetric methods were used to provide a detailed view onto the slags heat capacity and phase transitions.

Classical method such as METIS works well on relatively small graphs, but hard to scale for huge, dynamic graphs. Streaming graph partitioning algorithms overcome this issue by processing those graphs as streams. Among these algorithms, FENNEL achieves better edge cut ratio, even close to METIS, but consumes less memory and is significantly faster. On the other hand, graph partitioning may also benefit from distributed graph processing. However, to deploy FENNEL on a cluster, it is important to avoid quality loss and keep efficiency high. The direct implementation of this idea yields a synchronous model and a star-shaped network, which limits both scalability and efficiency. Targeting these two problems, we propose an asynchronous model, combined with a dedicated tree-shaped map-reduce network which is prevail in systems such as Apache Hadoop and Spark, to form AsyncFENNEL (asynchronous FENNEL). We theoretically prove that, the impact on partition quality brought by asynchronous model can be kept as minimal. We test AsyncFENNEL with various synthetic and real-world graphs, the comparison between synchronous and asynchronous models shows that, for streamed natural graphs, AsyncFENNEL can improve performance significantly (above 300% with 8 workers/partitions) with negligible loss on edge cut ratio. However, more worker nodes will introduce a heavier network traffic and reduce efficiency. The proposed tree-shaped map-reduce network can mitigate that impact and increase the performance in that case. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the Water Cloud Model (WCM) was coupled with the Ulaby soil moisture model to estimate both biomass and soil moisture for spring wheat fields in a test site in western Canada. This study exploited both C-band (RADARSAT-2) and L-band (UAVSAR) Synthetic Aperture Radars (SARs) for this purpose. The WCM-Ulaby model was calibrated for three polarizations (HH, VV and HV). Subsequently two of these three polarizations were used as inputs to an inversion procedure, to retrieve either soil moisture or biomass without the need for any ancillary data. The model was calibrated for total canopy biomass, the biomass of only the wheat heads, as well as for different wheat growth stages. This resulted in a calibrated WCM-Ulaby model for each sensor-polarization-phenology-biomass combination. Validation of model retrievals led to promising results. RADARSAT-2 (HH-HV) estimated total wheat biomass with root mean square (RMSE) and mean average (MAE) errors of 78.834 g/m(2) and 58.438 g/m(2); soil moisture with errors of 0.078 m(3)/m(3) (RMSE) and 0.065 m(3)/m(3) (MAE) are reported. During the period of crop ripening, L-band estimates of soil moisture had accuracies of 0.064 m(3)/m(3) (RMSE) and 0.057 m(3)/m(3) (MAE). RADARSAT-2 (W-HV) produced interesting results for retrieval of the biomass of the wheat heads. In this particular case, the biomass of the heads was estimated with accuracies of 38.757 g/m(2) (RSME) and 33.152 g/m(2) (MAE). For wider implementation this model will require additional data to strengthen the model accuracy and confirm estimation performance. Nevertheless this study encourages further research given the importance of wheat as a global commodity, the challenge of cloud cover in optical monitoring and the potential of direct estimation of the weight of heads where wheat production lies.

The discrimination capability of observations acquired by these sensors can be used for land cover classification and mapping. The aim of this paper is to propose an Optimized kernel-based C-means clustering algorithm for agriculture crop mapping from multi-temporal PoISAR data. Firstly, several polarimetric features are extracted from preprocessed data. These features are linear polarization intensities, and several statistical and physical based decompositions such as Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden and Yamaguchi techniques. Then, the kernelized version of hard and fuzzy C-means clustering algorithms are applied to these polarimetric features in order to identify crop types. The kernel function, unlike the conventional partitioning clustering algorithms, simplifies the non-spherical and non-linearly patterns of data structure, to be clustered easily. In addition, in order to enhance the results, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to tune the kernel parameters, cluster centers and to optimize features selection. The efficiency of this method was evaluated by using multi-temporal UAVSAR L -band images acquired over an agricultural area near Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, during June and July in 2012. The results demonstrate more accurate crop maps using the proposed method when compared to the classical approaches, (e.g. 12% improvement in general). In addition, when the optimization technique is used, greater improvement is observed in crop classification, e.g. 5% in overall.

The investigation is carried out through a series of synthetic experiments and real world tests using a merged soil moisture product (ESA CCI SM) developed by the European Space Agency, and considers both the joint state-parameter updating and only state updating schemes. The synthetic experiments show that with joint stateparameter update, the estimation of model parameter SOL_AWC (the available soil water capacity) and model states (the soil moisture in different depths) can be significantly improved by assimilating the surface soil moisture. Meanwhile, the runoff modeling for the whole catchment is also improved. With only state update, the improvement on runoff modeling shows less significance and robustness. Consistent with the synthetic experiments, the assimilation of the ESA CCI SM with joint state-parameter update shows considerable capability in the estimation of SOL_AWC. Both the joint stateparameter update and the only state update scheme could improve the streamflow modeling although the optimal model and observation error parameters for them are quite different. However, due to the high vegetation coverage of the study basin, and the strong spatial mismatch between the satellite and the model simulated soil moisture, it is still challenging to significantly benefit the runoff estimates by assimilating the ESA CCI SM.","Authors":"Liu, YW (Liu, Yongwei) ; Wang, W (Wang, Wen) ; Hu, YM (Hu, Yiming)","Title":"Investigating the impact of surface soil moisture assimilation on state and parameter estimation in SWAT model based on the ensemble Kalman filter in upper Huai River basin"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397817100019 ISSN: 0022-2461 eISSN: 1573-4803","Categories":"Materials Science Web of Science Categories:Materials Science, Multidisciplinary","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE Volume: 52 Issue: 11 Pages: 6376-6387 DOI: 10.1007/s10853-017-0871-6 Published: JUN 2017","Abstract":"Owing to their unique properties such as mechanical, optical, magnetic, nanomaterials attracted a great interest over the last two decades.

We simulate synthetic observations in CO lines and ultraviolet (UV) band. We adopt the star formation rate (SFR) defined in two ways: based on free fall collapse of a molecular cloud - Sigma(SFR,cl), and calculated by using a UV flux calibration - Sigma(SFR,UV). We study a KS relation for spatially smoothed maps with effective spatial resolution from molecular cloud scales to several hundred parsecs. We find that for spatially and kinematically resolved molecular clouds the Sigma(SFR,cl). alpha sigma(N)(gas) relation follows the power law with index N approximate to 1.4. Using UV flux as SFR calibrator, we confirm a systematic offset between the Sigma(SFR,UV) and Sigma(gas) distributions on scales compared to molecular cloud sizes. Degrading resolution of our simulated maps for surface densities of gas and SFRs, we establish that there is no relation Sigma(SFR,UV) -Sigma(gas) below the resolution similar to 50 pc. We find a transition range around scales similar to 50-120 pc, where the power-law index N increases from 0 to 1-1.8 and saturates for scales larger similar to 120 pc. A value of the index saturated depends on a surface gas density threshold and it becomes steeper for higher Sigma(gas) threshold. Averaging over scales with size of greater than or similar to 150 pc the power-law index N equals 1.3-1.4 for surface gas density threshold similar to 5 M-circle dot pc(-2). At scales greater than or similar to 120 pc surface SFR densities determined by using CO data and UV flux, Sigma(SFR),(UV/SFR),(cl), demonstrate a discrepancy about a factor of 3.

The ions responsible for forming the observed X-ray absorption lines may only exist in relatively cool clumps that can be identified with the socalled warm absorbers. Here we calculate synthetic absorption lines for such warm absorbers from first principles by combining 2D hydrodynamic solutions of a two-phase medium with a dense grid of photoionization models to determine the detailed ionization structure of the gas. Our calculations reveal that cloud disruption, which leads to a highly complicated velocity field (i.e. a clumpy flow), will only mildly affect line shapes and strengths when the warm gas becomes highly mixed but not depleted. Prior to complete disruption, clouds that are optically thin to the driving UV resonance lines will cause absorption at an increasingly blueshifted line-of-sight velocity as they are accelerated. This behaviour will imprint an identifiable signature on the line profile if warm absorbers are enshrouded in an even broader absorption line produced by a high column of intercloud gas. Interestingly, we show that it is possible to develop a spectral diagnostic for cloud acceleration by differencing the absorption components of a doublet line, a result that can be qualitatively understood using a simple partial covering model. Our calculations also permit us to comment on the spectral differences between cloud disruption and ionization changes driven by flux variability. Notably, cloud disruption offers another possibility for explaining absorption line variability.","Authors":"Waters, T (Waters, Tim) ; Proga, D (Proga, Daniel) ; Dannen, R (Dannen, Randall) ; Kallman, TR (Kallman, Timothy R.)","Title":"Synthetic absorption lines for a clumpy medium: a spectral signature for cloud acceleration in AGN?"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398421100051 ISSN: 0035-8711 eISSN: 1365-2966","Keywords":"astrochemistry; MHD; methods: numerical; methods; observational; stars: formation KeyWords Plus:TURBULENT MOLECULAR CLOUDS; INFRARED DARK CLOUDS; INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM; HIGH-MASS; COLUMN DENSITIES; PRESTELLAR CORES; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; SERPENS SOUTH; CO CHEMISTRY; DENSE CORES","Categories":"Astronomy & Astrophysics Web of Science Categories:Astronomy & Astrophysics","Journal Information":"MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY Volume: 467 Issue: 4 Pages: 4467-4483 DOI: 10.1093/mnras/stx399 Published: JUN 2017","Abstract":"We present synthetic continuum and (CO)-C-13 and (CO)-O-18 line emission observations of dense and cold filaments.

We investigate the reliability of observable properties, in particular filament mass and width, under different simulation conditions like magnetic field orientation and cosmic ray ionization rate. We find that filament widths of similar to 0.1 pc can be probed with both line and continuum emission observations with a high accuracy (deviations <= 20 per cent). However, the width of more narrow filaments can be significantly overestimated by up to a factor of a few. Masses obtained via the dust emission are accurate within a few per cent whereas the masses inferred from molecular line emission observations deviate from the actual mass by up to a factor of 10 and show large differences for different J transitions. The inaccurate estimate of filament masses and widths of narrow filaments using molecular line observations can be attributed to (i) the non-isothermal state of the filaments, (ii) optical depth effects and (iii) the subthermally excited state of CO, while inclination effects and opacity correction only influence the obtained masses and widths by less than 50 per cent. Both, mass and width estimates, can be improved by using two isotopes to correct for the optical depth.

Today, sugarcane is harvested mechanically and resultihg crop residues are retained as a mulch on the soil surface. We hypothesized that the combination of these activities (topdressing N fertilization applied on the mulching) promotes soil conditions that modify the microbiota involved in the soil N cycle, and consequently raise N2O emissions. We investigated a commercial sugarcane crop to determine whether a topdressing of N-fertilizer (100 kg N ha(-1) as ammonium nitrate) combined with sugarcane straw mulch (14 Mg ha(-1) dry mass) change soil attributes (pH, total C and N, microbial biomass C and N, inorganic-N and WFPS%), and the copy numbers of genes (nirS, nirK, norB and nosZ) involved in soil N-transformation with consequent increases in N2O emissions. The 3 x 2 factorial treatments were: three soil surface treatments: i) bare soil (no-straw); ii) sugarcane straw and, iii) synthetic straw (polypropylene strips) and with or without an application of N-fertilizer. The mulch treatments (sugarcane or synthetic) produced the highest emissions, which occurred at two 'N2O hot moments' within 10 days after fertilizatioh. Regarding fertilizer treatments, cumulative N2O emissions did not differ between the straw treatments (similar to 99 mg m-2) but were higher than those of the no-straw treatments (51 mg m-2). Similar behavior was found in the no-fertili2er treatments where the highest emissions were found in the straw treatments (similar to 30 mg m-2) and loWest in the no-straW treatments (6 mg m-2). The copy numbers of the nirS, nirK, norB and nosZ genes were equal in the straw treatments, but were significantly lower in the no-straw. While high copy numbers of the norB gene were associated with the 'N2O hot moments,' the same was not observed for the other genes. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that N2O emissions were higher in relatiOn to microbial biomass and WFPS% than they were in relation to the norB gene and inorganic-N. Our findings show that N-fertilization combined with sugarcane-straw mulching raised N2O emissions by promoting a chain of interactions between soil attributes and microorganisms involved in N-transformation.

For brain-machine interfaces (BMI) to be used in activities of daily living by paralyzed individuals, the BMI should be as autonomous as possible. One of the challenges is how the feedback is extracted and utilized in the BMI. Our long-term goal is to create autonomous BMIs that can utilize an evaluative feedback from the brain to update the decoding algorithm and use it intelligently in order to adapt the decoder. In this study, we show how to extract the necessary evaluative feedback from a biologically realistic (synthetic) source, use both the quantity and the quality of the feedback, and how that feedback information can be incorporated into a reinforcement learning (RL) controller architecture to maximize its performance. Approach. Motivated by the perception-action-reward cycle (PARC) in the brain which links reward for cognitive decision making and goal-directed behavior, we used a reward-based RL architecture named Actor-Critic RL as the model. Instead of using an error signal towards building an autonomous BMI, we envision to use a reward signal from the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) which plays a key role in the linking of reward to motor behaviors. To deal with the complexity and non-stationarity of biological reward signals, we used a confidence metric which was used to indicate the degree of feedback accuracy. This confidence was added to the Actor's weight update equation in the RL controller architecture. If the confidence was high (>0.2), the BMI decoder used this feedback to update its parameters. However, when the confidence was low, the BMI decoder ignored the feedback and did not update its parameters. The range between high confidence and low confidence was termed as the 'ambiguous' region. When the feedback was within this region, the BMI decoder updated its weight at a lower rate than when fully confident, which was decided by the confidence. We used two biologically realistic models to generate synthetic data for MI (Izhikevich model) and NAcc (Humphries model) to validate proposed controller architecture. Main results. In this work, we show how the overall performance of the BMI was improved by using a threshold close to the decision boundary to reject erroneous feedback. Additionally, we show the stability of the system improved when the feedback was used with a threshold. Significance: The result of this study is a step towards making BMIs autonomous. While our method is not fully autonomous, the results demonstrate that extensive training times necessary at the beginning of each BMI session can be significantly decreased. In our approach, decoder training time was only limited to 10 trials in the first BMI session. Subsequent sessions used previous session weights to initialize the decoder. We also present a method where the use of a threshold can be applied to any decoder with a feedback signal that is less than perfect so that erroneous feedback can be avoided and the stability of the system can be increased.","Authors":"Prins, NW (Prins, Noeline W.) ; Sanchez, JC (Sanchez, Justin C.) ; Prasad, A (Prasad, Abhishek)","Title":"Feedback for reinforcement learning based brain-machine interfaces using confidence metrics"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398193000003 PubMed ID: 27774794 ISSN: 1355-7858 eISSN: 1465-3419","Keywords":"Intravaginal practices; HPV; Haitian women; cervical cancer KeyWords Plus:HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS; BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS; HIV; TRANSMISSION; PREVALENCE; HEALTH","Categories":"Ethnic Studies; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health Web of Science Categories:Ethnic Studies; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Journal Information":"ETHNICITY & HEALTH Volume: 22 Issue: 3 Pages: 257-265 DOI: 10.1080/13557858.2016.1246423 Published: JUN 2017","Abstract":"Objective: Haitian women have the highest incidence of cervical cancer within the Western hemisphere.

As part of a community-based participatory research initiative aimed at reducing cervical cancer disparities in rural Haiti, we explored the use of intravaginal agents and their associations with high-risk HPV infection.Design: Community Health Workers recruited 416 women for cervical self-sampling from two neighborhoods within Thomonde, Haiti. Participants were interviewed regarding intravaginal hygiene practices and completed a cervical self-sampling procedure. Cervical samples were analyzed for the presence of high-risk HPV infection. Associations between each intravaginal agent and high-risk HPV infection were examined via univariate logistic regression analyses, as well as via multivariate analyses controlling for sociodemographic factors and concurrent agent use.Results: Nearly all women (97.1%) performed twalet deba, using a variety of herbal and commercially produced intravaginal agents. Approximately 11% of the participants tested positive for high-risk HPV. Pigeon pea and lime juice were the only agents found to be associated with high-risk HPV in the univariate analyses, with women who used these agents being approximately twice as likely to have high-risk HPV as those who did not. Only pigeon pea remained significantly associated with high-risk HPV after controlling for sociodemographic factors and concurrent agent use.Conclusion: Two agents, pigeon pea and lime juice, may contribute to risk for HPV infection in this population. Results suggest that in addition to cervical cancer screening interventions, future preventive initiatives should focus on minimizing risk by advocating for the use of less-toxic twalet deba alternatives.","Authors":"Seay, JS (Seay, Julia S.) ; Mandigo, M (Mandigo, Morgan) ; Kish, J (Kish, Jonathan) ; Menard, J (Menard, Janelle) ; Marsh, S (Marsh, Sarah); Kobetz, E (Kobetz, Erin)","Title":"Intravaginal practices are associated with greater odds of high-risk HPV infection in Haitian women"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398424400007 ISSN: 2053-1583","Keywords":"graphene; CVD; implants; Raman microspectroscopy; dry transfer; 3D KeyWords Plus:CHEMICAL-VAPOR-DEPOSITION; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; SINGLE-CRYSTAL GRAPHENE; OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION; LARGE-AREA; REPEATED GROWTH; RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; LAYER GRAPHENE; CVD GROWTH; IN-VITRO","Categories":"Materials Science Web of Science Categories:Materials Science, Multidisciplinary","Journal Information":"2D MATERIALS Volume: 4 Issue: 2 Article Number: 025060 DOI: 10.1088/2053-1583/aa6530 Published: JUN 2017","Abstract":"Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) grown graphene presents an efficient synthetic route for large-scale graphene production, however, current transfer methods are focused on transferring graphene onto planar substrates.

Due to its promises as a coating for medical applications, we investigated graphene transfer onto commercially available titanium implants with different geometries using a vacuum-assisted dry transfer method. A self-standing graphene-polymer tape is obtained by spin coating of a silicone polymer on the graphene, followed by the addition of a support layer, and the electrochemical delimitation of the growth substrate. The tape is then wrapped around the object and placed into a mould to conform to the surface. Using a pressure differential provided via partial vacuum, a uniform force is applied to the surface. Graphene characteristics are assessed by Raman spectroscopy and AFM. 74% and 95% coverage yields are obtained after a single transfer and double transfer respectively, with an observed increase in the number of graphene layers and an overall decrease in defect contributions. In vitro cell assays demonstrate that the coating is non-cytotoxic enabling further exploration of this method for medical applications.","Authors":"Morin, JLP (Morin, J. L.

Quite a few barrier solutions have been proposed, while they provide limited improvements for synchronizing large amounts of cores or incur unfavorable restrictions on performing concurrent barriers. This paper presents HyBar, a hardware barrier based on a hybrid switching NoC which adopts packet switching and circuit switching methods in two sub-networks respectively. Dedicated channels in the circuit-switching sub-network are dynamically built and removed when barrier requests traverse the packet-switching sub-network according to a modified dimensionorder routing algorithm. The efficiency of inter-core communication for concurrent barriers is improved by merging barrier arrival requests and broadcasting release requests along the circuit channels. The execution time of synthetic cases, benchmark kernels and parallel applications using various barrier solutions are evaluated in an RTL-based simulation platform. Experimental results show that our proposal provides about 15%-50% performance improvement compared to previous solutions, while the hardware overhead is marginal under SMIC 40 nm technology. Moreover, HyBar introduces a minor efficiency loss for concurrent barriers with no limitation on their layouts of participating cores in the on-chip network.","Authors":"Wei, ZQ (Wei, Zhenqi) ; Liu, PL (Liu, Peilin) ; Sun, RD (Sun, Rongdi)","Title":"HyBar: high efficient barrier synchronization based on a hybrid packet-circuit switching Network-on-Chip"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000394529300001 ISSN: 1674-733X eISSN: 1869-1919","Keywords":"synthetic aperture radar (SAR); fast factorized back-projection (FFBP); modified fast factorized back-projection (MFFBP); squinted SAR; motion compensation (MOCO) KeyWords Plus:SYNTHETIC-APERTURE RADAR; INTEGRATED MOTION COMPENSATION; CELL-MIGRATION CORRECTION; CHIRP SCALING APPROACH; MODE SAR; RAW DATA; RANGE; DOPPLER","Categories":"Computer Science Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Information Systems","Journal Information":"SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES Volume: 60 Issue: 6 Article Number: 062301 DOI: 10.1007/s11432-015-0927-3 Published: JUN 2017","Abstract":"In squinted synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, the range-azimuth coupling requires precise range cell migration correction (RCMC). Moreover, for high-resolution airborne SAR, motion compensation (MOCO) becomes complicated as the squint angle increases, thereby degrading the performance of Dopplerdomain imaging algorithms. On the other hand, time-domain back-projection (BP) SAR imaging approaches are considered as optimal solutions to performing precise image focusing and MOCO. Among current BP algorithms, the fast factorized back-projection (FFBP) algorithm is one of the most essential representatives that achieve high-resolution images in an efficient manner. In this paper, the principle and applications of the FFBP algorithm are investigated through the derivation of the azimuth impulse response function (AIRF) of the resulting image. The phenomenon of spectrum displacement induced by motion errors in the BP image is presented and analyzed. Based on rigorous mathematical derivations, a modified FFBP algorithm is proposed to facilitate a seamless integration with motion compensation and accurate imagery of high-resolution highly squinted airborne SAR.

The joint parcellation detection estimation model addresses this issue by inferring the parcels from fMRI data. However, it requires a priori fixing the number of parcels through an initial mask for parcellation. Hence, this difficult task generally depends on the subject. The proposed automatic parcellation approach in this paper overcomes this limitation at the subject-level relying on a Dirichlet process mixture model combined with a hidden Markov random field to estimate the parcels and their number online. The proposed method adopts a variational expectation maximization strategy for inference. Compared to the model selection procedure in the joint parcellation detection estimation framework, our method appears more efficient in terms of computational time and does not require finely tuned initialization. Synthetic data experiments show that our method is able to estimate the right model order and an accurate parcellation. Real data results demonstrate the ability of our method to aggregate parcels with similar hemodynamic behaviour in the right motor and bilateral occipital cortices while its discriminating power is increased compared to its ancestors.

Unlike previous EMD-based denoising methods, the proposed scheme can align common frequency modes across multiple channels of a multivariate data, thus, facilitating direct multichannel data denoising. The key idea in this work is to extend our earlier MEMD based denoising method for univariate signal in Hao et al. (2016) [19] to the multivariate data. The MEMD modes (known as intrinsic mode functions) for separating noise components are first adaptively selected on the basis of a similarity measure between the probability density function (pdf) of the input multivariate signal and that of each mode by Frobenius norm. The selected modes are then denoised further by a local interval thesholding procedure followed by reconstruction of the thresholded IMFs. The resulting method operates directly in multidimensional space where input signal resides, owing to MEMD, and also benefits from its mode-alignment property. Furthermore, subspace projection is introduced within the framework of the proposed method to exploit the inter-channel dependence among IMFs with the same index, enabling the diversity reception of the signal. Performance of the proposed method against standard multiscale denoising schemes is demonstrated on both synthetic and real world data.","Authors":"Hao, H (Hao, Huan) ; Wang, HL (Wang, H.

Therefore, in this work, it is attempted to develop an inversion approach to determine a 3D density distribution that produces a given gravity anomaly. The subsurface model consists of a 3D rectangular prisms of known sizes and positions and unknown density contrasts that are required to be estimated. The proposed inversion scheme incorporates the Cauchy norm as a model norm that imposes sparseness and the depth weighting of the solution. A physical-bound constraint is enforced using a generic transformation of the model parameters. The inverse problem is posed in the data space, leading to a smaller dimensional linear system of equations to be solved and a reduction in the computation time. For more efficiency, the low-dimensional linear system of equations is solved using a fast iterative method such as Lanczos Bidiagonalization. The tests carried out on the synthetic data show that the sparse data-space inversion produces blocky and focused solutions. The results obtained for the 3D inversion of the field gravity data (Mobrun gravity data) indicate that the sparse data-space inversion could produce the density models consistent with the true structures.","Authors":"Rezaie, M (Rezaie, M.) ; Moradzadeh, A (Moradzadeh, A.) ; Kalate, AN (Kalate, A.

The synthesis of spherical TiO2 catalytic materials with hollow structure and high surface areas was based on a self-assembly process induced by a mixture of organic acetic acid and ethanol. The possible formation mechanism of TiO2 spheres was proposed and verified by acid concentration-dependent and temperature-dependent experiments.

Emphasis was also placed on obtaining pure Li raffinate in the early stage of the process, as societal interest in Li is growing rapidly. Thus, the purpose was to first extract Co and Ni selectively yielding pure Li raffinate, and consequently separating Co and Ni as pure products in the stripping stage. The equilibrium behavior of the separation system was studied by constructing the pH isotherms as well as loading and stripping isotherms.

Co and Ni were loaded in two stages from the sulfate feed solution containing 2.8 of Li, 14.4 g/L of Co, and 0.5 of Ni. In this step, over 99.6% yields for Co and Ni were achieved, giving 99.9% pure Li raffinate. However, 17-26% of Li was co-extracted, but efficient scrubbing with NiSO4 was designed with equilibrium experiments and demonstrated in continuous operation. In the stripping step, 99.5% pure aqueous Ni solution and 99.2% pure organic Co solution were obtained using two counter-current stages. Adding one more stage increased the Ni and Co purities to 99.7 and 99.6%, respectively. In addition to the high purities of the metals, the suggested process has fewer process steps compared to previously suggested flowsheets for similar fractionation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Successful incorporation of iron ore slime within the membrane matrix was confirmed by X-ray diffractograms. Scanning electron micrographs confirmed the blockage of pores within polysulfone membranes by the additive, resulting in decrease of porosity, permeability and molecular weight cut off. However, improved hydrophilicity, higher surface roughness and arsenic uptake capacity of prepared membranes were observed. Mechanism of arsenic removal by the mixed matrix membrane was governed by electrostatic attraction mediated adsorption. Membrane with the highest additive percentage (10 wt%) produced arsenic free water for 14 h for real life feed solution at 11.5 L/m(2) h, when operated in dynamic mode. Exhausted membrane was regenerated for three cycles using synthetic solution. Breakthrough time for arsenic removal was reduced from 28 h to 22 h and 14 h after second and third cycle, respectively.

Functionalization was achieved through alkylation of N4 benzimidazole nitrogen with 9-(3-bromopropyl) adenine (9-BPA). The N9 adenine nitrogen that binds to deoxyribose in DNA molecule was inhere used for covalent binding to the PBI, leaving free the remaining adenine positions, as the ones available in a natural DNA molecule. Therefore, for the first time, the use of adenine based polymer is here suggested as a biomimicry strategy for degenotoxification of post-reaction synthetic active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) streams. The very same interactions responsible by in vivo genotoxicity, present in the novel adenine based polymer, PBI-A(x) %, were used for removal of a genotoxic impurity (GTI). Methyl p-toluenesulfonate (MPTS) at 100 ppm in dichloromethane was selected as a representative sulfonate GTI, which is present in a wide range of API post-reaction streams. The functionalization reaction efficiency was assessed using NMR at yields of 40-69% or 27-31%, for addition of 0.13-0.25 or 0.5-1.0 mol eq of 9-BPA to N4 PBI nitrogen, respectively.

The synthetic rutile can be obtained by selective thermal decomposition of the sulfated ilmenite, followed by targeted leaching for removal of various impurities. The results of the decomposition unit showed that almost all the TiOSO4 in the sulfated ilmenite decomposed to TiO2, while the iron component mainly existed in the form of sulfates in the optimal thermal decomposition conditions, i.e., a roasting temperature of 540 degrees C and a roasting time of 120 min under air flow or in stagnant air or a roasting temperature of 510 degrees C and a roasting time of 120 min under nitrogen flow. The thermal decomposition can be divided into three stages. The sulfates of titanium and iron in the sulfated ilmenite were first decomposed to TiO2 and water-insoluble FeOHSO4, respectively, at a temperature less than 500 degrees C. The FeOHSO4 was further converted into water-soluble Fe2O(SO4)(2) at 500-560 degrees C. Finally, the Fe2O(SO4)(2) was decomposed to Fe-2(SO4)(3) and Fe2O3 at a temperature above 560 degrees C. The water-soluble metal sulfates, the water-insoluble FeOHSO4/Fe2O3 and the SiO2 in the TiO2-containing slag can be removed through leaching by using water, dilute sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide, respectively. The results showed that 70-85% of the iron, as well as a majority of the magnesium, calcium, etc. impurities, could be leached by water, and up to 92% of the total iron could be removed after the subsequent acid leaching in a 15 wt% H2SO4 solution, while the silicon removal reached 65% in a 5 wt% NaOH solution. A synthetic rutile with a TiO2 content over 90 wt% and total MgO + CaO less than 1 wt% was obtained under the optimal conditions listed above. The present process can be integrated with the sulfate TiO2 process, producing titania pigment and synthetic rutile simultaneously. The advantages of the TiO2 beneficiation process include the moderate reaction conditions, the capability of recycling the H2SO4 completely and the recovery of a large part of the iron, as well as comprehensive utilization of the waste sulfuric acid discharged from the sulfate TiO2 production process.

In this paper, instead of analyzing each hypothesis individually, the residuals over all the hypotheses are used to explicitly construct an SDG, where a sorted weight score set and a minimum arrived distance set are respectively computed. Based on the SDG, the SPs corresponding to different structures can be easily determined. Compared with conventional robust model fitting approaches, one distinguishing characteristic of our approach is that the clustering procedure is not required. Therefore, the proposed approach is less disturbed by noises and outliers, and is relatively easy to implement.

Like its predecessors, video force microscopy and CellFIT, this cell mechanics technique assumes boundary-specific interfacial tensions to be the primary drivers, and it constructs force-balance equations based on triple junction (TJ) dihedral angles. The technique involves image processing, segmenting of cells, grouping of cell outlines, calculation of dihedral planes, averaging along three-dimensional TJs, and matrix equation assembly and solution. The equations tend to be strongly overdetermined, allowing indistinct TJs to be ignored and solution error estimates to be determined. Application to clean and noisy synthetic data generated using Surface Evolver gave tension errors of 1.6-7%, and analyses of eight-cell murine embryos gave estimated errors smaller than the 10% uncertainty of companion aspiration experiments.

Based on these findings, massive production of nano-structured CuO powders was successfully realized by using copper powder as the precursor.

Characterizations indicated that zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) coexisted with Fe2O3 structure was the predominant phase in the calcined electroplating sludge (CES). CES displayed a high decolorization ratio (88.3%) of methylene blue (MB) in the presence of H2O2 combined with UV irradiation. The high efficiency could be ascribed to the photocatalytic process induced by ZnFe2O4 and the photo-Fenton dye degradation by ferrous content, and a small amount of Al and Mg in the sludge might also contribute to the catalysis. Moreover, the degradation capability of dye by CES was supported by the synthetic ZnFe2O4 with different Zn to Fe molar ratio (n(Zn): n(Fe)), as 84.81%-86.83% of dye was removed with n(Zn): n(Fe) ranged from 1:0.5 to 1:3.

Present study was carried out in a pilot scale under such conditions as temperature of 30 +/- 1 degrees C, dissolved oxygen of 2.32 +/- 0.91 mg/1, pH of 8.01 +/- 0.95 and OLRs of 0.11-1.3gCOD/L.d. Also, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images were employed to specify rate of the biofilm formed on the media inside the reactor IFAS. The best removal efficiency for COD, LAS and oil and grease were respectively obtained as 92.52%, 94.24% and 90:07% in OLR 0.44gCOD/L.d. The assessment of loading rate indicated that with increased OLR to 0.44gCOD/Ld, removal efficiency of COD, oil and grease was increased while with increased OLR, removal efficiency was decreased. In doing so, based on the statistical test ANOVA, such a difference between removal efficiencies in diverse OLRs was significant for COD (p = 0.003), oil and grease (p = 0.01). However, in terms of LAS, with increased value of OLR to 0.44gCOD/L.d, the removal efficiency was increased and then with higher OLRs, removal efficiency was slightly decreased that is insignificant (p = 035) based on the statistical test ANOVA. The SEM images also showed that the biofilm formed on the media inside IFAS reactor plays a considerable role in adsorption and biodegradation of LAS, and oil & grease in greywater. The linear relation between inlet COD values and rate of removed LAS indicated that the ratio of inlet COD (mg/L) to removed LAS (mg/L) was 0.4. Therefore, use of IFAS systefn for biodegradation of LAS, oil and grease in greywater can be an applicable option. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

One-step green synthetic approach was developed for the synthesis of AuNCs by using chicken egg white (CEW) as template and stabilizer. Initially, TYR can catalyze the oxidation of dopamine to dopaminechrome, which can efficiently quench the fluorescence intensity of AuNCs at 630 nm based on dynamic quenching process. However, with the presence of OPs, the activity of TYR was inhibited, resulting in the fluorescence recovery of AuNCs. This proposed fluorescence platform was demonstrated to enable rapid detection for OPs (paraoxon as model) and to provide excellent sensitivity with a detection limit of 0.1 ng mL(-1) Significantly, the fluorescence probe was used to prepare paper-based test strips for visual detection of OPs, which validated the excellent potential for real-time and on-site application.","Authors":"Yan, X (Yan, Xu) ; Li, HX (Li, Hongxia) ; Hu, TY (Hu, Tianyu) ; Su, XG (Su, Xingguang)","Title":"A novel fluorimetric sensing platform for highly sensitive detection of organophosphorus pesticides by using egg white-encapsulated gold nanoclusters"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395599000058 ISSN: 0956-5663 eISSN: 1873-4235","Keywords":"Fluorescence resonance energy transfer; (FRET); Quantum dots; Silicone hydrogel; Tear glucose; Non-invasive biosensor KeyWords Plus:CONCANAVALIN-A; DIABETES-MELLITUS; QUANTUM DOTS; HYPERGLYCEMIA; NANOCRYSTALS; WAVELENGTH; HYDROGEL; FLUID","Categories":"Biophysics; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Chemistry; Electrochemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:Biophysics; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Chemistry, Analytical; Electrochemistry; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology","Journal Information":"BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS Volume: 91 Pages: 393-399 DOI: 10.1016/j.bios.2016.12.044 Published: MAY 15 2017","Abstract":"In this paper, a nanostructured biosensor is developed to detect glucose in tear by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) quenching mechanism. The designed FRET pair, including the donor, CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs), and the acceptor, dextran-binding malachite green (MG-dextran), was conjugated to concanavalin A (Con A), an enzyme with specific affinity to glucose. In the presence of glucose, the quenched emission of QDs through the FRET mechanism is restored by displacing the dextran from Con A. To have a dual-modulation sensor for convenient and accurate detection, the nanostructured FRET sensors were assembled onto a patterned ZnO nanorod array deposited on the synthetic silicone hydrogel. Consequently, the concentration of glucose detected by the patterned sensor can be converted to fluorescence spectra with high signal-to-noise ratio and calibrated image pixel value. The photoluminescence intensity of the patterned FRET sensor increases linearly with increasing concentration of glucose from 0.03 mmol/L to 3 mmol/L, which covers the range of tear glucose levels for both diabetics and healthy subjects. Meanwhile, the calibrated values of pixel intensities of the fluorescence images captured by a handhold fluorescence microscope increases with increasing glucose.

The results manifest that the superior photocatalytic activity of BiOI/ZnO composites is derived from the strong internal electric field between BiOI and ZnO, which is beneficial for the effective separation and transfer of photogenerated charges in ZnO. Moreover, the loading of BiOI on the surface of ZnO inhibited the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers in ZnO, resulting in excellent photocatalytic activity.

In this work, N-doped pomelo-peel-derived carbon (NPC) materials were prepared using a widely available food waste-pomelo peels and melamine. The synthetic NPC exhibits well-defined porosities and a highly doped-N content (e.g. 6.38 at% for NPC-2), therefore affords excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activities in alkaline electrolytes. NPC was further integrated with ZIF-67 to form ZIF-67@NPC hybrids through solvothermal reactions. The hybrid catalysts show substantially enhanced ORR catalytic activities comparable to that of commercial 20 wa Pt/C. Furthermore, the catalysts also exhibit excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activities. Among all prepared ZIF-67@NPC hybrids, the optimal composition with ZIF-67 to NPC ratio of 2:1 exhibits the best ORR and OER bifunctional catalytic performance and the smallest Delta E (E-OER@10 mA cm(-2)-E-ORR@-1 mA cm(-2)) value of 0.79 V. The catalyst also demonstrated desirable 4-electron transfer pathways and superior catalytic stabilities. The Co-N-4 in ZIF-67, electrochemical active surface area, and the strong interactions between ZIF-67 and NPC are attributed as the main contributors to the bifunctional catalytic activities. These factors act synergistically, resulting in substantially enhanced bifunctional catalytic activities and stabilities; consequently, this hybrid catalyst is among the best of the reported bifunctional electrocatalysts and is promising for use in metal-air batteries and fuel cells.

The addition of OAs exhibited significant bacterial inactivation enhancement, compared to the classic photo-Fenton systems (Fe2+/H2O2/solar and Fe3+/H2O2/solar). The improved disinfection performance was not attributed to pH variations by the addition of OAs, but to the increase of the initial dissolved iron in the system, facilitating the Fe3+/Fe2+ turnover in the catalytic photo-Fenton reaction and consequently, the hydroxyl radicals production. For citric and tartaric acid, increased photo-activity of the complexes was associated with their high capability to complex Fe3+ and to promote ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), which is of key importance to feed Fe2+ to the Fenton process. On the other hand, for ascorbic and caffeic acid, the acceleration of the homogeneous Fenton reaction was attributed to both their complexing and reductive properties of the acids. Both effects contributed to the enhancement of the E. coli inactivation. Moreover, the addition of OAs extracted from natural origin (lime, orange, coffee) showed a notable enhancement of the bacterial inactivation, attributed to the presence of the previously tested organic acids as key constituents of the selected natural products. Although the addition of synthetic or natural OAs into the system increased COD and DOC, bacterial inactivation and organic matter self-degradation was simultaneously and efficiently realized, making it a green and sustainable improvement method.

However, manipulating persulfate oxidation processes with desirable decontamination effectiveness is still underdeveloped. Towards this goal, we systematically investigated the catalytic behaviors of Oxone-MnOx/silica systems towards aqueous ibuprofen (IBU) degradation in terms of system effects, reaction kinetics and mechanisms. MnOx/SBA-15 (MS) demonstrated variable catalytic Oxone efficacies towards IBU removal at different solution pHs. Meanwhile, the catalyst supports and FeOx co-doping within MS also produced significant impacts on catalytic Oxone efficacy. Moreover, the catalytic Oxone efficacies of MS for IBU degradation were generally inhibited by humic acid, NO3-, HCO3-, SO42- and PO43- to different extents at low/high levels. Interestingly, Cl- at low concentrations (2 mM) obviously inhibited IBU removal by Oxone-MS, while Cl- at high concentrations (20 mM) greatly enhanced IBU removal. Kinetic studies implied that IBU removal by Oxone-MnOx/silica systems using two first-order kinetic models was closely related to the extents of the interferences of synthetic conditions and water chemistry components. The surface electron transfer between MnOx(OH)(y) species of MS and HSO5- of Oxone was responsible for the formation of reactive oxygen radicals, thus contributing to IBU degradation. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was employed to identify oxidation products of IBU, and reaction pathways of IBU oxidation were accordingly proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Results obtained showed that HPLC-ABTS method can be used for a rapid determination of individual antioxidant capacity of compounds in standard solutions or complex mixtures. The application of both methods to real lipophilic extracts from tomato (Soianum lycopersicum L.), green and red peppers (Capsicum annuum) reveals possible interactions between antioxidants. Thus, synthetic mixtures of two compounds identified in tomato and peppers were measured using microplate-ABTS and HPLC-ABTS. Synergistic effects were observed between (beta-carotene-capsanthin) (1:9) and (1:1), (alpha-tocopherol-capsanthin) (1:9), (lutein-lycopene) (9:1) and (capsanthin-delta-tocopherol) (9:1). On the contrary, antagonistic effects were observed for (lutein-delta-tocopherol) and (alpha-tocopherol-delta-tocopherol). The interactions observed with two-compound mixtures are not systematically observed in the natural lipophilic extracts from tomato, green and red peppers, probably since extracts are more complex and are susceptible to cause interferences.
