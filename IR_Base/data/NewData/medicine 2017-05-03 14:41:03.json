One of the applications of 3D scanners is the acquisition of anthropometric dimensions for ergonomics and the creation of an anthropometry data bank. The aim of this study was to evaluate the precision and accuracy of a modified 3D scanner fabricated in this study. Methods: In this work, a 3D scan of the human body was obtained using DAVID Laser Scanner software and its calibration background, a linear low-power laser, and one advanced webcam. After the 3D scans were imported to the Geomagic software, 10 anthropometric dimensions of 10 subjects were obtained. The measurements of the 3D scanner were compared to the measurements of the same dimensions by a direct anthropometric method. The precision and accuracy of the measurements of the 3D scanner were then evaluated. The obtained data were analyzed using an independent sample t test with the SPSS software. Results: The minimum and maximum measurement differences from three consecutive scans by the 3D scanner were 0.03 mm and 18 mm, respectively. The differences between the measurements by the direct anthropometry method and the 3D scanner were not statistically significant. Therefore, the accuracy of the 3D scanner is acceptable. Conclusion: Future studies will need to focus on the improvement of the scanning speed and the quality of the scanned image.","Authors":"Roodbandi, ASJ (Roodbandi, Akram Sadat Jafari) ; Naderi, H (Naderi, Hamid) ; Hashenmi-Nejad, N (Hashenmi-Nejad, Naser) ; Choobineh, A (Choobineh, Alireza) ; Baneshi, MR (Baneshi, Mohammad Reza) ; Feyzi, V (Feyzi, Vafa)","Title":"Technical Report on the Modification of 3-Dimensional Non-contact Human Body Laser Scanner for the Measurement of Anthropometric Dimensions: Verification of its Accuracy and Precision"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396489100006 ISSN: 1735-0328 eISSN: 1726-6890","Keywords":"Stachys lavandulifolia; labdan diterpenoid; flavonoid; monoterpen lacton; Lamiaceae KeyWords Plus:LABDANE-TYPE DITERPENOIDS; LEONURUS-HETEROPHYLLUS; LOLIOLIDE","Categories":"Pharmacology & Pharmacy Web of Science Categories:Pharmacology & Pharmacy","Journal Information":"IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH Volume: 16 Pages: 58-63 Special Issue: SI Published: WIN 2017","Abstract":"Stachys lavandulifolia Vahl is an herbaceous wild plant native to Iran which is traditionally used in Iranian folk medicine as a mild sedative tea for reducing anxiety and for treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.

The percentage of wound contraction on days 2, 7, 14 and 21 and histopathology parameters of healed wounds on 14(th) and 2(st) days were evaluated. Moreover, antioxidant activity of PHP was evaluated using DPPH method. There was a significant improvement in wound healing in PHP 10% group on the 7(th) day of the treatment (p<0.05). Moreover, the healing effect of PHP 10% was significantly greater than the control, tetracycline and paste base groups on the 2(nd), 14(th) and 21(st) days (p<0.05). On day 14, PHP 40% showed significant healing effect compared to the control, tetracycline and paste base groups (p<0.05). Fewer inflammatory cells were observed in PHP 10%-treated animals and this group demonstrated better re-epithelialization with remarkable neovascularization. Besides, the PHP 10% formulation exhibited antioxidant activity. In vivo and histopathologic examinations showed considerable wound healing in PHP 10% group.

Uptake of bone mineral density (BMD) tests among targeted men and women increased after both interventions and sustained increases in osteoporosis treatment were observed among men targeted in 2008. Purpose Educational interventions incorporating patient-specific prescriber feedback have improved osteoporosis screening and treatment among at-risk patients in clinical trials but have not been evaluated nationally. This study assessed uptake of BMD testing and osteoporosis medicines following two national Australian quality improvement initiatives targeting women (70-79 years) and men (75-85 years) at risk of osteoporosis. Methods Administrative health claims data were used to determine monthly rates of BMD testing and initiation of osteoporosis medicines in the 9-months post-intervention among targeted men and women compared to older cohorts of men and women. Log binomial regression models were used to assess differences between groups. Results In 2008 91,794 patients were targeted and 52,427 were targeted in 2011. There was a twofold increase in BMD testing after each intervention among targeted patients compared to controls (p < 0.001). Initiation of osteoporosis medicines increased by 21% among men targeted in 2008 and 34% among men targeted in 2011 compared to older controls (p < 0.01). Initiation of osteoporosis medicines among targeted women was similar to the older controls. Conclusion Programs underpinned by behavioural theory and stakeholder engagement that target both primary care clinicians and patients can improve osteoporosis screening and management at the national level.","Authors":"Ellett, LMK (Ellett, Lisa M.

The hormone replacement therapy and alendronate were frequently used to treat osteoporosis as the primary therapeutic strategy, but their adverse effects have severely limited their extensive clinical application, therefore, it is urgent to develop alternative or complementary therapeutic agents for anti-osteoporosis. Interestingly, with more people focusing on the complementary and alternative medicine, traditional Chinese herbs and formulas are being gradually recognized as safe and effective agents in the treatment of osteoporosis. In particular, a notable trend is that increasing studies are making efforts to clarify the anti-osteoporotic effects and mechanism of the tonifying kidney-yin herbs and formulas, a category of agents identified as effective therapy. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to comprehensively review the tonifying kidney-yin herbs and formulas that have been reported in the treatment of osteoporosis as well as how the agents play their roles in detail. This current study not only will advance our understanding of the actions of tonifying kidney-yin herbs and formulas, but also provide new evidence for the clinic use of the tonifying kidney-yin herbs and formulas in the treatment of osteoporosis.","Authors":"He, JB (He, Jian-Bo) ; Chen, MH (Chen, Mei-Hui) ; Lin, DK (Lin, Ding-Kun)","Title":"New insights into the tonifying kidney-yin herbs and formulas for the treatment of osteoporosis"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000394592400007 ISSN: 1523-4614 eISSN: 1526-5498","Keywords":"queueing games; service operations; healthcare management; consumer behavior; incentives in healthcare operations KeyWords Plus:HEALTH-INSURANCE; CARE SERVICES; MEDICARE; DEMAND; MEDICINE; PAYMENTS; SYSTEM; TIMES; PRICE; RISK","Categories":"Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science Web of Science Categories:Management; Operations Research & Management Science","Journal Information":"M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT Volume: 19 Issue: 1 Pages: 99-113 DOI: 10.1287/msom.2016.0594 Published: WIN 2017","Abstract":"Motivated by a collaborative study with one of the most comprehensive ocular imaging programs in the United States, we investigate the underlying three-way trade-off among operational, clinical, and financial considerations in physicians' decisions about ordering imaging tests. Laboratory tests may be processed in parallel and thus have a limited effect on patients' waiting times; imaging tests, by contrast, require patient presence and thus directly influence patients'waiting times. We use a strategic queueing framework to model a physician's decision of ordering imaging tests and show that insurance coverage is the key driver of overtesting. Our further analysis reveals the following: (i) Whereas existing studies hold that lower out-of-pocket expenses lead to higher consumption levels, we refine this statement by showing the copayment and the coinsurance rate drive the consumption in different directions. Thus, simply expanding patient cost sharing is not the solution to overtesting. (ii) Setting a low reimbursement ceiling alone cannot eliminate overtesting. (iii) The joint effect of misdiagnosis concerns and insurance coverage can lead to both overtesting and undertesting even when no reimbursement ceiling exists. These and other results continue to hold under more general conditions and are therefore robust. We enrich our model along two extensions: one with patient heterogeneity in diagnostic precision, and the other with disparities in health insurance coverage. Our findings have implications for other healthcare settings with similar trade-offs.","Authors":"Dai, TL (Dai, Tinglong) ; Akan, M (Akan, Mustafa) ; Tayur, S (Tayur, Sridhar) Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number Dai, TinglongÂ  http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9248-5153","Title":"Imaging Room and Beyond: The Underlying Economics Behind Physicians' Test-Ordering Behavior in Outpatient Services"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395524000007 PubMed ID: 28154443 ISSN: 0300-0508 eISSN: 1708-8313","Keywords":"mentorship; survey KeyWords Plus:PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT; PHYSICAL-THERAPISTS; ACADEMIC MEDICINE; RESIDENTS; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; STUDENTS; BARRIERS; PROGRAM","Categories":"Rehabilitation Web of Science Categories:Rehabilitation","Journal Information":"PHYSIOTHERAPY CANADA Volume: 69 Issue: 1 Pages: 38-46 DOI: 10.3138/ptc.2015-52 Published: WIN 2017","Abstract":"Purpose: This study explored the factors that influence mentors in the profession of physiotherapy (PT) in Canada when engaging in a mentorship relationship.

The present study provided data and methods to authenticate some of these oils and has compared applicability of different fingerprinting methods for their authenticity. Methods: Thirteen oils were prepared according to the traditional manuscripts. High performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC), ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) fingerprinting data were analyzed using MATLAB software. For HPTLC fingerprints a special coding system was designed according to the R-f values. The fingerprinting data were subjected to principal components (PCs) analysis. Melting point and thermal behavior of the oils were obtained by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Also, the refractive indices, acid and peroxide values were obtained for the oils. Results: The designed coding system for HPTLC was successfully able to produce a discriminative unique fingerprint for each sample. Among UV, IR and HPTLC fingerprinting, the last one seemed more reliable than others to authenticate the oils. The acid values (0.22-3.85), peroxide values (2.31-34.35 meq/kg) and refractive indices (1.4622 - 1.4706) were in acceptable ranges for most of these oils.

The oral group received 250 mg capsules of ginger powder and the topical group applied five drops of ginger oil topically every 6 hours from two days before through the first three days of menstruation for three cycles. The severity and duration of pain, and the number of mefenamic acid consumption were assessed in each cycle. Before-after changes were evaluated in each group and were compared between two groups. Results: The reduction of pain severity was 3(+/- 3.2) in the topical compared to 2.6(+/- 3.4) in the oral group (p<0.001). The reduction of pain duration was 14.5(+/- 20.1) h in the topical compared to 14.5(+/- 19.8) h in the oral group (p<0.001). The reduction of mefenamic consumption was 0.4(+/- 1.6) in the topical (p=0.9) compared to 0.5(+/- 1.3) in the oral group (p=0.006). The reduction in pain severity, duration and mefenamic consumption were similar between two groups (p>0.05). Complications were observed in 54.2% of participants in oral group. Conclusions: This study showed that ginger in both oral and topical forms showed similar positive effects on decreasing the severity and duration of pain in primary dysmenorrhea; however, the topical ginger oil was a better choice because it showed no complications.","Authors":"Shirooye, P (Shirooye, P.) ; Hashem-Dabaghian, F (Hashem-Dabaghian, F.) ; Hamzeloo-Moghadam, M (Hamzeloo-Moghadam, M.) ; Afrakhteh, M (Afrakhteh, M.) ; Bioos, S (Bioos, S.) ; Mokaberinejad, R (Mokaberinejad, R.)","Title":"A clinical comparative study of oral and topical ginger on severity and duration of primary dysmenorrhea"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000392202700004 ISSN: 2345-5977","Keywords":"antibacterial effect; Drimia maritima; proscillaridinA; squill; toxicity KeyWords Plus:URGINEA-MARITIMA; CARDIAC GLYCOSIDE; PLANT-EXTRACTS; COUGH LINCTUS; CELL-LINE; TOXICITY; CYTOTOXICITY","Categories":"Pharmacology & Pharmacy Web of Science Categories:Pharmacology & Pharmacy","Journal Information":"RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOGNOSY Volume: 4 Issue: 1 Pages: 33-39 Published: WIN 2017","Abstract":"Background and objectives: Squill [Drimia maritima (L.)

Many studies have shown a central role for transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF beta-1) and its downstream signaling cascades in the pathogenesis of CKD. In this study, we have reanalyzed a microarray dataset to recognize critical signaling pathways controlled by TGF beta-1. Materials and Methods: This study is a bioinformatics reanalysis for a microarray data. The GSE23338 dataset was downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database which assesses the mRNA expression profile of TGF beta-1 treated human kidney cells after 24 and 48 hours incubation. The protein interaction networks for differentially expressed (DE) genes in both time points were constructed and enriched. In addition, by network topology analysis, genes with high centrality were identified and then pathway enrichment analysis was performed with either the total network genes or with the central nodes. Results: We found 110 and 170 genes differentially expressed in the time points 24 and 48 hours, respectively. As the genes in each time point had few interactions, the networks were enriched by adding previously known genes interacting with the differentially expressed ones. In terms of degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality parameters 62 and 60 nodes were considered to be central in the enriched networks of 24 hours and 48 hours treatment, respectively. Pathway enrichment analysis with the central nodes was more informative than those with all network nodes or even initial DE genes, revealing key signaling pathways. Conclusion: We introduced a method for the analysis of microarray data that integrates the expression pattern of genes with their topological properties in protein interaction networks. This holistic novel approach allows extracting knowledge from raw bulk omics data.","Authors":"Rabieian, R (Rabieian, Reyhaneh) ; Abedi, M (Abedi, Maryam) ; Gheisari, Y (Gheisari, Yousof)","Title":"Central Nodes in Protein Interaction Networks Drive Critical Functions in Transforming Growth Factor Beta-1 Stimulated Kidney Cells"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000386792500010 PubMed ID: 28042541 ISSN: 2228-5806 eISSN: 2228-5814","Keywords":"2A Peptide; CpG Dinucleotide; Extrachromosomal Plasmid; Polycistronic; Reprogramming KeyWords Plus:PLURIPOTENT STEM-CELLS; EXPRESSION IN-VIVO; HUMAN SOMATIC-CELLS; TRANSGENE EXPRESSION; GENE-EXPRESSION; TRANSIENT TRANSFECTION; DNA TOPOLOGY; HIGH-LEVEL; GENERATION; VECTORS","Categories":"Cell Biology Web of Science Categories:Cell Biology","Journal Information":"CELL JOURNAL Volume: 18 Issue: 4 Pages: 565-581 Published: WIN 2017","Abstract":"Objective: Induced pluripotent stem cells are generated from somatic cells by direct reprogramming. These reprogrammed pluripotent cells have different applications in biomedical fields such as regenerative medicine. Although viral vectors are widely used for efficient reprogramming, they have limited applications in the clinic due to the risk for immunogenicity and insertional mutagenesis. Accordingly, we designed and developed a small, non-integrating plasmid named pLENSO/Zeo as a 2A-mediated polycistronic expression vector. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we developed a single plasmid which includes a single expression cassette containing open reading frames of human LIN28, NANOG, SOX2 and OCT4 along with an EGFP reporter gene. Each reprogramming factor is separated by an intervening sequence that encodes a 2A self-processing peptide. The reprogramming cassette is located downstream of a CMV promoter. The vector is easily propagated in the E. coli GT115 strain through a CpG-depleted vector backbone. We evaluated the stability of the constructed vector bioinformatically, and its ability to stoichiometric expression of the reprogramming factors using quantitative molecular methods analysis after transient transfection into HEK293 cells. Results: In the present study, we developed a nonviral episomal vector named pLENSO/Zeo. Our results demonstrated the general structural stability of the plasmid DNA. This relatively small vector showed concomitant, high-level expression of the four reprogramming factors with similar titers, which are considered as the critical parameters for efficient and consistent reprogramming. Conclusion: According to our experimental results, this stable extrachromosomal plasmid expresses reliable amounts of four reprogramming factors simultaneously. Consequently, these promising results encouraged us to evaluate the capability of pLENSO/Zeo as a simple and feasible tool for generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from primary cells in the future.","Authors":"Dormiani, K (Dormiani, Kianoush) ; Sadeghi, HMM (Sadeghi, Hamid Mir Mohammad) ; Sadeghi-Aliabadi, H (Sadeghi-Aliabadi, Hojjat) ; Forouzanfar, M (Forouzanfar, Mahboobeh) ; Baharvand, H (Baharvand, Hossein) ; Ghaedi, K (Ghaedi, Kamran) ; Nasr-Esfahani, MH (Nasr-Esfahani, Mohammad Hossein)","Title":"Rational Development of A Polycistronic Plasmid with A CpG-Free Bacterial Backbone as A Potential Tool for Direct Reprogramming"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000386792500014 PubMed ID: 28042545 ISSN: 2228-5806 eISSN: 2228-5814","Keywords":"Dental Pulp; Stem Cells; Development; Genes KeyWords Plus:NOTCH; DIFFERENTIATION; EXPRESSION; ISOFORMS; PATHWAY; TEETH","Categories":"Cell Biology Web of Science Categories:Cell Biology","Journal Information":"CELL JOURNAL Volume: 18 Issue: 4 Pages: 609-618 Published: WIN 2017","Abstract":"Objective: Pulp and periodontal tissues are well-known sources of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that provide a promising place in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

Many photo-therapeutic methods have been developed to overproduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) to trigger lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP)-associated cell death pathway. However, these technologies rely on extra irradiation to activate the photosensitizers, which limits the applications in treating deep seated tumors and widespread metastatic lesions. This work reports a multifunctional nanocapsule to achieve targeted lysosomal tumor cell death without irradiation and real-time monitoring of drug effect through encapsulating artemisinin and dual protease light-up nanoprobe in a folate-functionalized liposome. The nanocapsule can be specifically uptaken by tumor cells via folate receptor-mediated endocytosis to enter lysosomes, in which artemisinin reacts with ferrous to generate ROS for LMP-associated cell death. By virtue of confocal fluorescence imaging, the artemisinin location in lysosome, ROS-triggered LMP and ultimate cell apoptosis can be visualized with the cathepsin B and caspase-3 activatable nanoprobe. Notably, the artemisinin-mediated ROS evolving for tumor therapy and real-time therapeutic monitoring were successfully implemented by living imaging in tumor-bearing mice, which broaden the nanocapsule for in vivo theranostics and may offer new opportunities for precise medicine.","Authors":"Huang, LW (Huang, Liwei) ; Luo, YP (Luo, Yingping) ; Sun, X (Sun, Xian) ; Ju, HX (Ju, Huangxian) ; Tian, JW (Tian, Jiangwei) ; Yu, BY (Yu, Bo-Yang)","Title":"An artemisinin-mediated ROS evolving and dual protease light-up nanocapsule for real-time imaging of lysosomal tumor cell death"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398425800019 PubMed ID: 28222304 ISSN: 0021-9797 eISSN: 1095-7103","Keywords":"G-C3N4; AgI; Heterojunction; Visible light photocatalysis; Diclofenac KeyWords Plus:TROUT ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; DRUG DICLOFENAC; RAINBOW-TROUT; HETEROJUNCTION PHOTOCATALYST; PHOTOGENERATED CARRIERS; ADVANCED OXIDATION; Z-SCHEME; G-C3N4; WATER","Categories":"Chemistry Web of Science Categories:Chemistry, Physical","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE Volume: 496 Pages: 167-176 DOI: 10.1016/j.jcis.2017.02.022 Published: JUN 15 2017","Abstract":"A visible-light-driven heterostructured AgI/g-C3N4 was prepared by a deposition-precipitation method.

AgI/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts exhibited higher photocatalytic activities than those of Agl nanoparticles and g-C3N4 in the degradation of diclofenac (a model anti-inflammatory medicine) under visible light irradiation (X. > 400 nm). When the mass molar ratio of AgI was 45% in AgI/g-C3N4, the reaction rate constant of diclofenac degradation reached 0.561 min(-1), which was almost 12.5 and 43.2 times higher than that achieved by AgI (0.045 min(-1)) and g-C3N4 (0.013 min(-1)). The h(+) and O-2(-) were pinpointed as the main reactive species in the photocatalytic reaction using their obligate radical scavengers. Diclofenac was. completely degraded and partly mineralized during the photodegradation. The main intermediates were determined by liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (LC-MS), and toxicological assessments were carried out to evaluate the change of toxicity in the degradation process. In addition, the photocatalysts showed excellent stability over multiple reaction cycles. Finally, a possible photocatalytic and charge separation mechanism was proposed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Sometimes due to almost illegible handwriting, it is difficult to understand the medication reports of doctors. This often confuses the patients about the actual medicine/disease names written by doctors and as a consequence they suffer. A medical prescription is generally partitioned into two parts, a printed letterhead part containing the doctor's name, designation, organization name, etc. and a handwritten part where the doctor writes patient's name and report his/her findings and suggests medicine names. There are many significance impacts of the proposed work. For example, such work can be used (i) to develop expert diagnostic systems (ii) to extract information from patient history that can be obtained by this proposed method (iii) to detect wrong medication (iv) to make different statistical analysis of the medicines prescribed by the doctors etc. To extract the information from such document images, first we extract the domain specific knowledge of doctors by identifying department names from the printed text that appears in letterhead part. From the letterhead text, the specialty/expertise of doctors is understood and this helps us to search only relevant prescription documents for word spotting in handwritten portion. Word spotting in letterhead part as well as in handwritten part has been performed using Hidden Markov Model. An efficient MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) based Tandem feature is proposed to improve the performance. From the experiment with 500 prescriptions, we have obtained encouraging results. Information from printed letterhead part improved the word spotting performance in handwritten part, significantly. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Optimized conditions for successful GM solubilization proceeded with 1 mol l(-1) of sodium or potassium hydroxide and 2 wt% dispersion of GM at room temperature. A novel mechanism was suggested and by this mechanism the complex plant based biopolymer can be solubilized through the careful control of its ionic environment and degree of deacetylation.

This study was aimed to investigate whether in vitro pre-treatment of MSCs obtained from human gingiva (hGMSCs) with Cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid component produced by the plant Cannabis sativa, may promote human gingiva derived MSCs to differentiate toward neuronal precursor cells. Specifically, we have treated the hGMSCs with CBD (5 mu M) for 24h in order to evaluate the expression of genes involved in cannabidiol signaling, cell proliferation, self-renewal and multipotency, and neural progenitor cells differentiation. Next generation sequencing (NGS) demonstrated that CBD activates genes associated with G protein coupled receptor signaling in hGMSCs. Genes involved in DNA replication, cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis were regulated. Moreover, genes associated with the biological process of neuronal progenitor cells (NCPs) proliferation, neuron differentiation, neurogenesis, and nervous system development were significantly modulated. From our results, we hypothesize that human gingiva-derived MSCs conditioned with CBD could represent a valid method for improving the hGMSCs phenotype and thus might be a potential therapeutic tool in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Mature adipocytes are derived and differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or preadipocytes.

Notch1 signaling is a highly conserved pathway that is indispensable for stem cell hemostasis and tissue development. In adipocyte progenitor cells, Notch1 signaling regulates the adipogenesis process including proliferation and differentiation of the adipocyte progenitor cells in vitro. Notably, the roles of Notch1 signaling in beige adipocytes formation, adipose development, and function, and the whole body energy metabolism have been recently reported.

As an example, human-induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) obtained by reprograming of patient somatic cells are sufficiently similar to embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and can generate all cell types of the human body. Clinical use of iPSCs is dependent on methods that do not utilize genome altering transgenic technologies that are potentially unsafe and ethically unacceptable. Transient delivery of exogenous RNA into cells provides a safer reprogramming system to transgenic approaches that rely on exogenous DNA or viral vectors. RNA reprogrammed iPSCs lines may prove to be more suitable for clinical applications and provide stable starting cell lines for gene-editing, isolation, and characterization of patient iPSC lines. The introduction and rapid evolution of CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing systems has provided a readily accessible research tool to perform functional human genetic experiments. Similar to RNA reprogramming, transient delivery of mRNA encoding Cas9 in combination with guide RNA sequences to target specific points in the genome eliminates the risk of potential integration of Cas9 plasmid constructs. We present optimized RNA-based laboratory procedure for making and editing iPSCs. In the near-term these two powerful technologies are being harnessed to dissect mechanisms of human development and disease in vitro, supporting both basic, and translational research.

Whilst overall, diverticulitis affects only 4% of those with diverticulosis, in younger patients ( aged 40-49 years) this peaks at 11%. Diverticulosis is one of the most common chronic diseases, yet research in this field on pathogenesis has lagged behind other common conditions such as diabetes mellitus. However, in the last decade there have been major advances in taxonomy that can be used to relate to patients' outcome and treatment in both medicine and surgery. It has been shown there is an association with age, diet, drugs and smoking. Genetic studies have shown a familial association and a specific gene, TNFSF 15 may predict severity of disease. The role of the microbiome has been explored and microbial and metabolomic signatures are also important in predicting disease severity. That diverticulosis is a chronic disease is shown by mucosal pathology with subtle chronic inflammation present in those with asymptomatic diverticulosis and inflammation may lead to muscular hypertrophy, enteric nerve remodeling with disordered motility. The diverticulitis quality of life instrument shows that this condition impacts markedly on patients' well-being and prevention and amelioration of complications should be the aim of treatment and further research to attain this goal is needed.","Authors":"Walker, MM (Walker, Marjorie M.) ; Harris, AK (Harris, Angela K.)","Title":"Pathogenesis of diverticulosis and diverticular disease"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395963300110 ISSN: 0925-4005","Keywords":"Optical fiber; Sensor; Coating functionalization; Molecular sieve; GABA KeyWords Plus:PERFORMANCE LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; GLUTAMATE-DECARBOXYLASE; HIGH-SENSITIVITY; GABA; NORADRENALINE; MICRODIALYSIS; TEMPERATURE; SEROTONIN; BIOSENSOR; DOPAMINE","Categories":"Chemistry; Electrochemistry; Instruments & Instrumentation Web of Science Categories:Chemistry, Analytical; Electrochemistry; Instruments & Instrumentation","Journal Information":"SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL Volume: 244 Pages: 934-940 DOI: 10.1016/j.snb.2017.01.031 Published: JUN 2017","Abstract":"An ultrasensitive tapered fiber-optic sensor functionalized with size-selective molecular sieve (Fe3O4@SiO2@meso SiO2 microspheres) arrays for label-free gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) detection has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated.

In the present study, polyethylene-glycol-(PEG)ylated reduced graphene oxide (PrGO) was synthesized, characterized, and its interaction with mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was studied. in vitro cytotoxicity and differentiation study showed PrGO neither induced toxicity nor impaired the differentiation potential of the stem cells. PrGO was effectively internalized by MSCs and distributed throughout the cytoplasm. None of the PrGO was seen in the nucleus. Although it seems to induce increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production inside the cell, no change in cell proliferation or cellular function was observed. Hence it is recommended that the synthesized PrGO is applicable for tissue engineering, and can also be used as a substrate platform for stem cell culture and differentiation.","Authors":"Syama, S (Syama, S.) ; Aby, CP (Aby, C.

In this context, we here introduce a novel cancer subtype classifier from gene expression data and we apply it to two different Breast Cancer datasets, from TCGA and GEO repositories. The classifier is based on Support Vector Machines and relies on the information about the relevant pathways involved in breast cancer development to reduce the huge variable space. Among the main results, we show that the classifier accuracy is preserved at excellent values even when the variable space is reduced by a 20-fold, hence providing a precious tool for cancer patient profiling even in case of limited experimental resources.","Authors":"Graudenzi, A (Graudenzi, Alex) ; Cava, C (Cava, Claudia) ; Bertoli, G (Bertoli, Gloria) ; Fromm, B (Fromm, Bastian) ; Flatmark, K (Flatmark, Kjersti) ; Mauri, G (Mauri, Giancarlo) ; Castiglioni, I (Castiglioni, Isabella)","Title":"Pathway-based classification of breast cancer subtypes"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397916900010 PubMed ID: 28410143 ISSN: 1093-9946 eISSN: 1093-4715","Keywords":"Radionuclide therapy; Cancer; Imaging; Review KeyWords Plus:DIFFERENTIATED-THYROID-CANCER; DOSE-POINT KERNELS; I-AND-T; NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS; NUCLEAR-MEDICINE; DOSIMETRY; PET; PATIENT; SPECT; RADIOEMBOLIZATION","Categories":"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology Web of Science Categories:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology","Journal Information":"FRONTIERS IN BIOSCIENCE-LANDMARK Volume: 22 Pages: 1750-1759 Published: JUN 1 2017","Abstract":"The concept of targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) relies on the use of injected nuclear medicine as treating agents, targeted at the cellular or molecular level.

In recent years, different studies on TRT were focused on the evaluation of radionuclide compounds able to combine imaging of the disease with TRT, in a theranostic approach. This approach is of particular interest towards the personalization of treatments, allowing both the baseline characterization of oncological pathologies and treatment optimization by correct dosimetric calculation as well as therapy monitoring.

As will be shown in this paper, one way to overcome this is to construct rough membership functions for covering-based rough sets. In this paper, we first use an example in evidence-based medicine to illustrate how to use Pawlak's rough membership function on numerically characterizing decisions under the circumstances where data are complete. Then, we construct covering-based rough membership functions for four types of covering-based rough sets which were examined by Zhu and Wang (in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering 19(8)(2007) 1131-1144 and Information Sciences 201(2012) 80-92), and use them to characterize these covering-based rough sets numerically.

However, not every patient benefits equally from either treatment. Identifying moderators of treatment outcome can help to better understand which treatment is best suited for a particular patient. Methods: Forty-nine individuals who met criteria for social anxiety disorder were assessed as part of a randomized controlled trial comparing 12 weeks of CBT and ACT. Pre-treatment avoidance of social situations (measured via a public speaking task and clinician rating) was investigated as a moderator of post-treatment, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up social anxiety symptoms, stress reactivity, and quality of life. Results: Public speaking avoidance was found to be a robust moderator of outcome measures, with more avoidant individuals generally benefitting more from CBT than ACT by 12-month follow-up. In contrast, clinician-rated social avoidance was not found to be a significant moderator of any outcome measure. Limitations: Results were found only at 12-month follow-up. More comprehensive measures of avoidance would be useful for the field moving forward. Conclusions: Findings inform personalized medicine, suggesting that social avoidance measured behaviorally via a public speaking task may be a more robust factor in treatment prescription compared to clinician-rated social avoidance.

Detailed 3D studies of flow in the arterial system based on the Navier-Stokes equations require high computational power, hence reduced models are often used, both for the constitutive laws and the spatial domain. In order to capture the major features of the phenomena under study, such as variations in arterial pressure and flow velocity, the resulting PDE models on networks require appropriate junction and boundary conditions. Instead of considering an entire network, we simulate portions of the latter and use inflow and outflow conditions which realistically mimic the behavior of the network that has not been included in the spatial domain. The resulting PDEs are solved numerically using a discontinuous Galerkin scheme for the spatial and Adam-Bashforth method for the temporal discretization. The aim is to study the effect of truncation to the flow in the root edge of a fractal network, the effect of adding or subtracting an edge to a given network, and optimal control strategies on a network in the event of a blockage or unblockage of an edge or of an entire subtree.","Authors":"Cascaval, RC (Cascaval, Radu C.) ; D'Apice, C (D'Apice, Ciro) ; D'Arienzo, MP (D'Arienzo, Maria Pia) ; Manzo, R (Manzo, Rosanna)","Title":"FLOW OPTIMIZATION IN VASCULAR NETWORKS"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397688200040 ISSN: 1383-5866 eISSN: 1873-3794","Keywords":"Experimental design; Extraction; Optimization; Thymus serpyllum; Total polyphenols KeyWords Plus:RESPONSE-SURFACE METHODOLOGY; AQUEOUS TEA INFUSIONS; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; ESSENTIAL OILS; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; SOLVENT-EXTRACTION; WILD THYME; SALVIA-OFFICINALIS; LIQUID EXTRACTION","Categories":"Engineering Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Chemical","Journal Information":"SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY Volume: 179 Pages: 369-380 DOI: 10.1016/j.seppur.2017.01.055 Published: MAY 31 2017","Abstract":"Despite the fact that Thymus serpyllum is well-known medicinal plant and its chemical profile and biological activity have been investigated, there is no detailed study regarding the influence of different techniques and conditions on the extraction of polyphenolic compounds from Serpylli herba. The aim of this study was optimization of the extraction parameters that improves the efficiency of polyphenols extraction from T. serpyllum: particle size, solid-to-solvent ratio, solvent type and extraction time, by using maceration, heat- and ultrasound-assisted extraction (HAE and UAE). The extraction efficiency was expressed via total polyphenol content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC). The statistical analysis (one-way ANOVA and full factorial design) has revealed that the optimal conditions for achieving the best polyphenols yield were particle size of 0.3 mm, 1:30 solid-to-solvent ratio and 50% ethanol, as environmentally friendly extraction medium, while extraction time has not shown statistically significant influence on polyphenols concentration, in all procedures. Under these conditions, the measured TPC was 26.6 mg GAE/L in maceration, 29.8 mg GAE/L in HAE and 32.7 mg GAE/L in UAE, which was in agreement with the predicted values, while TFC was 143 mg CE/L, 12.4 mg CE/L and 16.7 mg CE/L for maceration, HAE and UAE, respectively. According to total polyphenols yield, the efficiency of the extraction methods for all variables was ranked by significance in the following order: UAE > HAE > maceration, whereas total flavonoids yield was the highest in UAE, although there was no statistically significant difference between maceration and HAE. According to our results, UAE could be selected as the most successful and suitable technique for extraction of bioactive polyphenolic compounds from Serpylli herba. Using LC/MS and HPLC analysis, 9 polyphenolic compounds were identified and quantified: 6,8-Di-C-glucosylapigenin, chlorogenic acid, 6-hydroxyluteolin 7-O-glucoside, caffeic acid, luteolin 7-O-glucuronide, apigenin glucuronide, salvianolic acid g isomer, rosmarinic acid and salvianolic acid I.

Molecular integrative models of cancer, generated with the help of data from experimental assays, facilitate use of control theory to probe for ways of controlling the state of such a complex dynamic network. We modeled the human cancer signaling network as a directed graph and analyzed it for its controllability, identification of driver nodes and their characterization. We identified the driver nodes using the maximum matching algorithm and classified them as backbone, peripheral and ordinary based on their role in regulatory interactions and control of the network. We found that the backbone driver nodes were key to driving the regulatory network into cancer phenotype (via mutations) as well as for steering into healthy phenotype (as drug targets). This implies that while backbone genes could lead to cancer by virtue of mutations, they are also therapeutic targets of cancer. Further, based on their impact on the size of the set of driver nodes, genes were characterized as indispensable, dispensable and neutral. Indispensable nodes within backbone of the network emerged as central to regulatory mechanisms of control of cancer. In addition to probing the cancer signaling network from the perspective of control, our findings suggest that indispensable backbone driver nodes could be potentially leveraged as therapeutic targets. This study also illustrates the application of structural controllability for studying the mechanisms underlying the regulation of complex diseases. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Men with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer following local therapies often use natural supplements in an attempt to delay metastases and/or avoid the need for more aggressive treatments with undesirable side-effects. While there is a growing body of research into phytotherapeutic agents in this cohort, with some promising results, as yet no definitive recommendations can be made. This pilot study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of a fully-powered study to examine the effects of this phytotherapeutic intervention (containing turmeric, resveratrol, green tea and broccoli sprouts) on PSA doubling time in men with biochemical recurrence with a moderate PSA rise rate. METHODS. A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial was conducted with 22 men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer and a moderate rise rate (PSA doubling time of 4-15 months and no evidence of metastases from conventional imaging methods). Patients were randomized to either the active treatment arm or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoints were feasibility of study recruitment and procedures, and measurement of proposed secondary endpoints (prostate symptoms, quality of life, anxiety, and depression as measured on the EORTC QLQ-C30 and PR-25, the IPSS and HADS). Data were collected to estimate PSA-log slopes and PSA-doubling times, using a mixed model, for both the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods. RESULTS. Adherence to study protocol was excellent, and the phytotherapeutic intervention was well-tolerated, with similar numbers of mild-to-moderate adverse events in the active and placebo arms. Both the intervention and data collection methods were acceptable to participants. No statistical difference between groups on clinical outcomes was expected in this pilot study. There was between-subject variation in the PSA post treatment, but on average the active treatment group experienced a non-significant increase in the log-slope of PSA (pre-treatment doubling time = 10.2 months, post-treatment doubling time = 5.5 months), and the placebo group experienced no change in the log-slope of PSA (pre-treatment doubling time = 10.8 months, post-treatment doubling time = 10.9 months). CONCLUSION. The findings suggest that a fully powered study of this combination is feasible in men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer and a moderate PSA rise rate.

Given the frequency with which T2D and AD occur, the notion that people with T2D may be at increased risk for AD has large societal consequences, and understanding the mechanistic links between these diseases is imperative for the development of effective AD prevention and treatment strategies. Apart from being an accelerator of AD, T2D is associated with a progressive cognitive decline. Impaired insulin signaling, inflammation, the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products and oxidative stress all play an essential role in the pathogenesis of both AD and diabetic complications. Therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that these pathways are involved in the increased risk of dementia that occurs in the T2D population. The early diagnosis of cognitive impairment and the identification of the subset of patients at a higher risk of developing AD is a challenge for healthcare providers, and meeting it will permit us to implement a personalized medicine, which is an essential issue in diabetes care with significant therapeutic implications.

In the present work, we employ core-only CdTe quantum dots and study their cytotoxicity using a validated high-content screening approach. The data revealed a clear correlation between toxicity and quantum dot degradation, which could be monitored through loss of fluorescence intensity. Based on the in vitro data obtained, the in vivo dose was calculated relative to the estimated number of tumor cells based on luminescence measurements. The obtained results show a clear increase in reproducibility of the therapeutic effect compared to normal conditions, where a set dose of quantum dots was administered regardless of the tumor size. The therapeutic delivery could also be monitored in vivo, where the loss of fluorescence intensity correlated with the anticancer efficacy. The present work highlights the benefits of noninvasive imaging to monitor therapeutic delivery and to optimize treatment via personalized medicine. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Elastin-like peptides are attractive candidates as a platform for novel biomaterial design because they exhibit a highly tunable response spectrum, with reversible phase transition capabilities. Here, we report the design of the first virtual library of elastin-like protein models using methods for enhanced sampling to study the effect of peptide chemistry, chain length, and salt concentration on the structural transitions of ELPs, exposing associated molecular mechanisms. We describe the behavior of the local molecular structure under increasing temperatures and the effect of peptide interactions with nearest hydration shell water molecules on peptide mobility and propensity to exhibit structural transitions. Shifts in the magnitude of structural transitions at the single-molecule scale are explained from the perspective of peptide-ion-water interactions in a library of four unique elastin-like peptide systems. Predictions of structural transitions are subsequently validated in experiment. This library is a valuable resource for recombinant protein design and synthesis as it elucidates mechanisms at the single-molecule level, paving a feedback path between simulation and experiment for smart material designs, with applications in biomedicine and diagnostic devices.

As an emerging tissue engineering scaffold fabrication technology, 3D bioprinting has shown great promise in fabricating customizable artificial tissue matrices with hierarchical structures. The goal of the present study is to investigate 3D bioprinted graphene oxide (GO)-doped gelatin based scaffolds for promoting chondrogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In the current study, GO-gelatin methacrylate (GeIMA) poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) was prepared as a biocompatible photopolymerizable bioink. GO, a multifunctional carbon based nanomaterial, was incorporated into the bioink for promoting chondrogenic differentiation. Finally, the 3D printed GeIMA-PEGDA-GO scaffold with hierarchical structures was fabricated via our novel table-top stereolithography-based printer. Results showed that GeIMA-PEGDA-GO scaffolds greatly promoted the glycosaminoglycan, and collagen levels after GO induced chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs. Moreover, the Collagen II, SOX 9, and Aggrecan gene expressions associated with chondrogenesis were greatly promoted on the scaffolds. This study demonstrated that customizable 3D printed GeIMA-PEGDA-GO scaffolds are excellent candidates for promoting chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs and are therefore promising candidates for future cartilage regenerative medicine applications.

The influence of the concentration of antibiotics on adsorption kinetics is still unclear. This study used sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and ofloxacin (OFL) as adsorbates to investigate the adsorption kinetics on sediment affected by varying concentrations of antibiotics adsorbable species. At the experimental pH values, the major adsorbed species of SMX and OFL on sediment were SMX and OFL+ by hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic attraction, respectively. The apparent adsorption rate of SMX was not affected by the initial concentration and the pH values because the hydrophobic interactions were concentration-independent and charge-independent. However, the apparent adsorption rate of OFL significantly slowed down as the initial concentration increased. The adsorbed OFL+ effectively neutralized the negative charges of the sediment, leading to a reduced adsorption rate of subsequent OFL+. The neutralization effect was greatly enhanced due to the increased OFL+ with the increasing OFL concentration. Additionally, the apparent adsorption rate of OFL significantly increased at higher pH due to the reduced neutralization effect that resulted from the decreased OFL+ and increased negative charges of the sediment surface. This study implied that the adsorption kinetics of antibiotics was greatly dominated by the concentration of adsorbable species rather than apparent overall concentration. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a unique mix of cements (calcium aluminate cement passed through a 150 gm sieve and ordinary Portland cement) was developed for Z-Corporation's three-dimensional printing (3DP) process. This cement mix was blended and the resulting composite powders were printed with a water-based binder using a Z-Corporation 3D printer. Moreover, some samples were added lithium carbonate to reduce the setting time for the cement mixture. The aims of the study were to firstly, find the proper cementitious powder close to the targeted powder (Z-powder); and secondly, evaluate the mechanical properties of this material. Cubic specimens of two different batches With varying saturation levels were cast and cured in various scenarios to enhance the best mechanical properties. The samples were characterised by porosity analyses, compression tests, Olympus BX61 Microscope imaging, 3D profiling Veeco (Dektak) and the Scanning Electronic Microscope (SEM). The maximum compressive strength of the cubic specimens for cementitious 3DP was 8.26 MPa at the saturation level of 170% for both the shell and core.

The influence of the metal salts on primary human mononuclear cells was analyzed by measuring cell viability using the water-soluble tetrazolium salt assay, apoptosis and necrosis induction by annexin V/propidium iodide staining and proliferation by carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester staining and flow cytometry. Effects on T-cell activation were assessed with CD69 and CD25 expression using flow cytometry whereas CD83, CD86 and CD14 expression was measured to evaluate the influence on dendritic cell maturation. Alterations of interleukin-2 and interferon- secretion were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and genotoxic effects were analyzed using the comet assay. At sub-toxic concentrations retardation of T-cell proliferation was caused by Pb(NO3)(2), AuCl3 and Cu(NO3)(2) and inhibitory effects on interleukin-2 secretion were measured after incubation with Pb(NO3)(2), AuCl3, Cu(NO3)(2), HgCl2 and AsCl3.

Immunosenescence, dysregulation of macrophage function, and delayed resolution of immune responses in aged individuals have all been demonstrated, suggesting that host responses to materials in aged individuals should differ from those in younger individuals. However, few studies examining the effects of aging upon the host response have been performed. The present work sought to elucidate the impacts of aging upon the host response to polypropylene mesh implanted into 8-week-old and 18-month-old mice. The results showed that there are significant differences in macrophage surface marker expression, migration, and polarization during the early host macrophage response and delayed resolution of the host response in 18-month-old versus 8-week-old mice. These differences could not be attributed to cell-intrinsic defects alone, suggesting that the host macrophage response to implants is likely also dictated to a significant degree by the local tissue microenvironment. These results raise important questions about the design and testing of materials and devices often intended to treat aged individuals and suggest that an improved understanding of patient- and context-dependent macrophage responses has the potential to improve outcomes in aged individuals.

Local intervention by intra-marrow injection is potentially a good choice for preventing osteoporotic bone loss when the osteoporotic femoral fracture was treated. Previously, it was shown that trace element co-doped calcium phosphate (teCaP) implants could stimulate osteoporotic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell activity in vitro and bone regeneration in femoral bone defects in osteoporotic animal models. They hypothesized that local intra-marrow injection of teCaP particles could improve bone function because the teCaP can sustain release of biologically essential inorganic minerals and improve bone remodeling in osteoporosis. The teCaP and CaP particles were synthesized in simulated body fluid with and without adding silicon, zinc and strontium ions. Female rats (8 months) were ovariectomized (OVX) or sham-operated, and then intervened in the femoral marrow space at 12 months old. Groups include: (1) saline water; (2) CaP particles; and (3) teCaP particles. After 2-3 months of intervention, the sham groups showed higher bone mineral density (MBD) in the femur, and teCaP group increased the BMD in the OVX groups. The compressive strength of the OVX-teCaP group was significantly higher than that in the OVX-CaP group. Significant differences between OVX-teCaP and OVX-CaP groups were found for bone mineral microarchitecture, bone mineral density, and trace mineral content, but not for feces composition. These results confirm the teCaP particles could suppress osteoporotic bone loss by local intramarrow injection. Therefore, this biomaterial could be used as a next-generation combination treatment for osteoporotic trauma and osteoporosis itself.

Previous reports revealed that various flavonoids have anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, and cell differentiation-regulating activities with a number of physiological benefits, including protection from cardiovascular disease, cancers, and oxidative stress. As we found that the hydroxylation patterns of the flavonoid B ring are known to play a critical role in their function, we screened several flavonoids containing different numbers and positions of OH substitutions in B ring for their modulatory property on adipogenesis. In this study, we revealed the anti-adipogenic activity of the naturally derived flavonoid, 3,4-dihydroxyflavone (3,4-DHF) in murine 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and equine adipose-derived stromal cells (eADSCs). We found that treatment with 3,4-dihydroxyflavone (3,4-DHF) led to decreased expression of adipogenic markers and lipid deposition with differential modulation of ROS and kinase signaling pathways. Regulation of ROS generation through the differential modulation of ROS-regulating gene expression was revealed to have an important role in the suppression of adipogenesis and increase of osteogenesis in eADSCs following 3,4-DHF treatment. These results suggest that the flavonoid 3,4-DHF can be used to regulate adipogenesis in ADSCs, which has potential therapeutic application in regenerative medicine or health care for humans and many sport or companion animals.

ASCs were isolated from healthy donors, due to surgical resection, power-, and laser-assisted liposuction. Isolated cells were characterized by their clonogenicity, proliferation rate, doubling time, multilineage differentiation, and senescence potential. The average number of ASCs from 1g/1ml of solid adipose tissue/lipoaspirate was 2.9x10(5)+/- 2.4x10(5), 1.1x10(5)+/- 0.8x10(5), and 1.2x10(5)+/- 0.7x10(5), respectively, for ASCsR, ASCsPAL, and ASCsLAL. However, number of colonies formed by ASCsR and ASCsPAL was significantly higher compared to the average number of colonies formed by ASCsLAL. Also, in comparison to other analyzed cell groups, ASCsPAL obtained the highest proliferative activity. All analyzed cells were characterized by stable expression of CD90 and CD44 markers during prolonged culture. Expression of CD34 and CD45 markers was decreasing in subsequent passages. Presented study shows that different ASCs collection method affects some basic characteristics of these cells, such as number of isolated cells, clonogeneity, or doubling time. J. Cell.

Unfortunately, recent research has demonstrated that a large proportion of safety hazards remain unrecognized in construction workplaces. To improve hazard-recognition levels, employers adopt a variety of safety and hazard-recognition training programs. However, desirable levels of hazard recognition have not been achieved, and the expected benefits from training have not been attained. Such failure in training efforts have generally been attributed to the adoption of poor and ineffective training practices. While efforts are being undertaken to address these issues, construction research has not focused on developing or evaluating personalized training solutions that are customized to the learning needs of individual workers. To advance theory and practice, the objective of this study was to develop the first personalized training strategy targeted at improving hazard-recognition levels. The objective was accomplished by a collaborative effort involving two industry experts and three academic researchers, along with guidance from training literature. The training strategy incorporates important elements known to improve stimuli or threat detection in domains including medicine, the military, and aviation. The elements include (1)visual cues to aid systematic hazard search, (2)personalized hazard-recognition performance feedback, (3)personalized eye-tracking visual attention feedback, and (4)metacognitive prompts that trigger the adoption of remedial measures. After development, the effectiveness of the training strategy in improving hazard recognition was empirically evaluated using the nonconcurrent multiple-baseline testing approach. The findings of the study showed that the participating workers on average were able to identify only 42% of hazards prior to the introduction of the intervention; but were able to recognize 77% of hazards in the intervention phase. The findings of this study will be of interest to practicing professionals seeking to improve hazard-recognition levels within construction.

Its heterogeneity and rarity often result in underpowered clinical trials making the analysis and interpretation of associated molecular data challenging. We performed a meta-analysis of gene expression data from skin biopsies of patients with systemic sclerosis treated with five therapies: mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, abatacept, nilotinib, and fresolimumab. A common clinical improvement criterion of -20% or -5 modified Rodnan skin score was applied to each study. We applied a machine learning approach that captured features beyond differential expression and was better at identifying targets of therapies than the differential expression alone. Regardless of treatment mechanism, abrogation of inflammatory pathways accompanied clinical improvement in multiple studies suggesting that high expression of immune-related genes indicates active and targetable disease. Our framework allowed us to compare different trials and ask if patients who failed one therapy would likely improve on a different therapy, based on changes in gene expression. Genes with high expression at baseline in fresolimumab nonimprovers were downregulated in mycophenolate mofetil improvers, suggesting that immunomodulatory or combination therapy may have benefitted these patients. This approach can be broadly applied to increase tissue specificity and sensitivity of differential expression results.","Authors":"Taroni, JN (Taroni, Jaclyn N.) ; Martyanov, V (Martyanov, Viktor) ; Mahoney, JM (Mahoney, J.

Gene addition strategies have shown efficacy in junctional EB and in recessive dystrophic EB (RDEB). TALENs and Cripsr/Cas9 have emerged as highly efficient new tools to edit genomic sequences to creat new models and to correct or disrupt mutated genes to treat human diseases. Therapeutic approaches have not been limited to DNA modification and strategies at the mRNA, protein and cellular levels have also emerged, some of which have already proven clinical efficacy in RDEB. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of skin disorders has led to the development of specific drugs or repurposing of existing medicines as in basal cell nevus syndrome, alopecia areata, melanoma and EB simplex.

There are limited data regarding the occurrence of pertussis in travelers. The objective of this study is to identify travel-related pertussis cases reported to the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network. Methods: This is a descriptive, retrospective analysis of GeoSentinel records from 25 travel/tropical medicine clinics in 16 countries. Frequencies of demographic and travel-related characteristics and symptoms of 74 cases of pertussis in travelers and new immigrants from 1999 to 2015 were analysed. Results: There were 74 probable and confirmed cases of pertussis in the GeoSentinel database; median age was 44 years, and 38 (51%) patients were female. Tourism was the most common reason for travel (41; 55%). Country of exposure was determined in 66 cases with travelers returning from India and China constituting the highest number of cases (10 cases each; 15% each). Seventy of 74 (95%) patients had respiratory symptoms, while fatigue and fever were reported by 21 (28%) and 20 (27%), respectively. Immunization status against pertussis was unknown. Most cases were reported after 2005 (69; 93%). Conclusions: Our study describes 74 cases of pertussis acquired during travel and reported to the GeoSentinel Network. Pertussis should be considered in returned travelers who present with respiratory symptoms. Surveillance and detection of imported cases are important to prevent onward transmission in the community. The pre-travel consultation provides an opportunity to verify immunization status and provide routine vaccinations such as pertussis.","Authors":"Barbosa, F (Barbosa, Felipe) ; Barnett, ED (Barnett, Elizabeth D.) ; Gautret, P (Gautret, Philippe) ; Schlagenhauf, P (Schlagenhauf, Patricia) ; van Genderen, PJJ (van Genderen, Perry J.

We also examined the relationship between dietary zinc intake and urinary zinc excretion between cases and controls. Materials and Methods: We conducted a nested case-control study within a large pediatric health care system.

Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between daily zinc intake and incident calcium kidney stones, adjusting for dietary phytate, protein, calcium, sodium and oxalate. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate the association between dietary and urine zinc, adjusting for urine creatinine and dietary phytate and calcium. Results: Cases had lower daily zinc intake (8.1 mg) than controls (10 mg, p = 0.029). Daily zinc intake of boys and girls with calcium stones was 2 mg and 1.2 mg less, respectively, than the daily intake recommended by the Institute of Medicine. Odds of incident stones were reduced by 13% for every 1 mg increase in daily zinc intake (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75e0.99). There was an estimated 4.5 mg/dl increase in urine zinc for every 1 mg increase in dietary zinc (p = 0.009), with weak evidence of a smaller increase in urine zinc in cases than in controls (interaction p = 0.08).

Arterial hypertension is genetically complex: multiple genes influence the blood pressure phenotype through allelic effects from single genes and gene-gene interactions. Moreover, environmental factors also modify the blood pressure phenotype. This complexity explains why the identification of the underlying genes has not been as successful in hypertension as in other diseases (such as type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus). The identification of the genetic determinants of hypertension has been most successful in endocrine forms of hypertension, which have well-defined phenotypes that permit a precise patient stratification into homogeneous cohorts. A promising area for the application of genetic testing to personalized medicine is the prediction of responses and adverse reactions to antihypertensive drugs. The identification of genetic markers of drug response will enable the design of randomized controlled trials in much smaller series of patients than is currently possible, decreasing the costs and times from drug design to clinical use and ultimately providing patients and doctors with a larger number of tools to combat hypertension, the most important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This Review focuses on the rapidly developing field of genetic testing in patients with arterial hypertension.","Authors":"Rossi, GP (Rossi, Gian Paolo) ; Ceolotto, G (Ceolotto, Giulio); Caroccia, B (Caroccia, Brasilina); Lenzini, L (Lenzini, Livia)","Title":"Genetic screening in arterial hypertension"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398537500006 PubMed ID: 28273690 ISSN: 1467-7881 eISSN: 1467-789X","Keywords":"Gestational diabetes; Institute of Medicine recommendations; pregnancy outcomes; weight gain KeyWords Plus:BODY-MASS INDEX; OF-MEDICINE GUIDELINES; MATERNAL WEIGHT; PREPREGNANCY WEIGHT; BIRTH-WEIGHT; PERINATAL OUTCOMES; WOMEN; MELLITUS; RISK; ASSOCIATION","Categories":"Endocrinology & Metabolism Web of Science Categories:Endocrinology & Metabolism","Journal Information":"OBESITY REVIEWS Volume: 18 Issue: 5 Pages: 567-580 DOI: 10.1111/obr.12521 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"The Institute of Medicine updated guidelines for gestational weight gain in 2009, with no special recommendations for gestational diabetes.

We calculated the pooled prevalence of gain adequacy and relative risks for pregnancy outcomes within Institute of Medicine categories. Thirty-three studies/abstracts (88,599 women) were included. Thirty-one studies provided data on the prevalence of weight gain adequacy; it was adequate in 34% (95% CI: 29-39%) of women, insufficient in 30% (95% CI: 27-34%) and excessive in 37% (95% CI: 33-41%). Excessive gain was associated with increased risks of pharmacological treatment, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, caesarean section, large for gestational age and macrosomic babies, compared to adequate or non-excessive gain. Weight gain below the guidance had a protective effect on large babies (RR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.56-0.90) and macrosomia (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.40-0.83), and did not increase the risk of small babies (RR 1.40; 95% CI 0.86-2.27).

Procedure: We developed a novel 15-item self-assessment instrument to address this gap in fellowship training. Fellows (N = 122) were asked to assess their skills in five domains: balancing competing demands of fellowship, caring for the dying patient, confronting depression and burnout, responding to challenging relationships with patients, and practicing humanistic medicine. An expert focus group predefined threshold scores on the instrument that could be used as a cutoff to identify fellows who need support. Reliability and feasibility were assessed and concurrent validity was measured using three established instruments: Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Flourishing Scale (FS), and Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE). Results: For 90 participating fellows (74%), the self-assessment proved feasible to administer and had high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.81). It was moderately correlated with the FS and MBI (Pearson's r = 0.41 and 0.4, respectively) and weakly correlated with the JSPE (Pearson's r = 0.15). Twenty-eight fellows (31%) were identified as needing support. The self-assessment had a sensitivity of 50% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 31-69) and a specificity of 77% (95% CI: 65-87) for identifying fellows who scored poorly on at least one of the three established scales. Conclusions: We developed a novel assessment instrument for use in pediatric fellowship training. The new scale proved feasible and demonstrated internal consistency reliability. Itsmoderate correlation with other established instruments shows that the novel assessment instrument provides unique, nonredundant information as compared to existing scales.","Authors":"Kesselheim, JC (Kesselheim, Jennifer C.) ; Agrawal, AK (Agrawal, Anurag K.) ; Bhatia, N (Bhatia, Nita) ; Cronin, A (Cronin, Angel) ; Jubran, R (Jubran, Rima) ; Kent, P (Kent, Paul) ; Kersun, L (Kersun, Leslie) ; Rao, AN (Rao, Amulya Nageswara) ; Rose, M (Rose, Melissa)[ 10 ] ; Savelli, S (Savelli, Stephanie)[ 11 ] ; Sharma, M (Sharma, Mukta)[ 12 ] ; Shereck, E (Shereck, Evan)[ 13 ] ; Twist, CJ (Twist, Clare J.)[ 14 ] ; Wang, M (Wang, Michael)[ 15 ] ...More...Less","Title":"Measuring pediatric hematology-oncology fellows' skills in humanism and professionalism: A novel assessment instrument"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397996500014 ISSN: 1545-5009 eISSN: 1545-5017","Keywords":"personalized medicine, targeted therapy, TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, variant of unknown, significance KeyWords Plus:MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE; PHILADELPHIA-CHROMOSOME; TYROSINE KINASE; CHILDHOOD; INHIBITOR; IKZF1","Categories":"Oncology; Hematology; Pediatrics Web of Science Categories:Oncology; Hematology; Pediatrics","Journal Information":"PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER Volume: 64 Issue: 5 Article Number: UNSP e26328 DOI: 10.1002/pbc.26328 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"A 17-year-old girl with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) with persistent minimal residual disease (MRD) who underwent standard chemotherapy was found to have a BCR-ABL1-like gene expression pattern.

Prolonged standing is associated with multiple risk factors for musculoskeletal and venous disorders. In Germany over 50% of the working population spend most of their working time in a standing position. Basic understanding of prolonged standing physiology is lacking. We therefore plan to investigate the influence of 5 h standing (including breaks) on lower limb oedema measured by waterplethysmography (WP) and bioelectrical impedance (BI) and fatigue in the triceps surae muscle using muscle twitch force (MTF). In order to interpret our results, test-retest and inter-rater reliability of these measurement methods was evaluated first. Approach. 20 subjects (9 female) were included to test each method three times (M1, M2, M3) in 30 min periods with two raters (R1, R2) on separate days. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC; 2,1), standard error of measurement (SEM) and smallest real difference (SRD) were calculated for both raters. Main results. The SEM and SRD calculated for WP were 27 and 75 ml, respectively, for R1 and 23 and 64 ml, respectively, for R2 with an ICC of 0.98 (p < 0.0001). Statistically significant mean differences between M1 and M2 (R1 = 23 ml, p = 0.004; R2 = 19 ml, p = 0.027) but not significant mean differences between M2 and M3 (R1 = -6 ml, p = 0.45; R2 = 4 ml, p = 0.27) were calculated for both raters. BI data revealed SEM and SRD values of 3.8 and 10.5 Omega, respectively, for R1 and 3.4 and 9.4 Omega, respectively, for R2 with an ICC of 0.24 (p = 0.001). The differences between M1 and M2 (R1 = 3.9 Omega, p = 0.0001; R2 = 2.4 Omega, p = 0.049) and between M2 and M3 (R1 = 2.3 Omega, p = 0.012; R2 = 2.0 Omega, p = 0.008) were found to be statistically significant for both raters. SEM and SRD for MTF were 0.19 and 0.53 N, respectively, for R1 and 0.23 and 0.64 N, respectively, for R2 with an ICC of 0.71 (p < 0.0001). Mean differences between M1 and M2 were statistically significant for rater 1 but not for rater 2 (R1 = 0.13 N, p = 0.022; R2 = 0.12 N, p = 0.082) and the same was found for the difference between M2 and M3 for both raters (R1 = 0.04 N, p = 0.37; R2 = 0.08 N, p = 0.12). Significance. All three measurement methods showed good reliability and should be suitable for detecting effects of standing work on oedema development and fatigue as seen in previous results of long term standing experiments. Inter-rater reliability is found to be satisfactory as well, demonstrated by the small differences in SEM values of R1 and R2. Statistically significant differences shown for all three measurement methods could be due to lacking standardisation of leg placement and thus an actual lower leg volume change between measurements, indicating possibilities for further improvement of SEM values.","Authors":"Wall, R (Wall, Rudolf) ; Lips, O (Lips, Oliwia); Seibt, R (Seibt, Robert); Rieger, MA (Rieger, Monika A.); Steinhilber, B (Steinhilber, Benjamin)","Title":"Intra-and inter-rater reliability of lower leg waterplethysmography, bioelectrical impedance and muscle twitch force for the use in standing work evaluation"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397696100028 PubMed ID: 28219697 ISSN: 0031-9384","Keywords":"Salvia miltiorrhiza; Memory; Cholinesterase; Gene expression; Rat KeyWords Plus:COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MICE; CRYPTOTANSHINONE; SCOPOLAMINE; PEPTIDE","Categories":"Psychology; Behavioral Sciences Web of Science Categories:Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences","Journal Information":"PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR Volume: 173 Pages: 223-230 DOI: 10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.02.019 Published: MAY 1 2017","Abstract":"Salvia miltiorrhiza (Lamiaceae), one of the most important and popular plants of traditional medicine of Asia, is used for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and in central nervous system disturbances.

Huperzine A (HU, 0.5 mg/kg b.w., p.o.) served as a positive control substance, whereas scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) injection was used as a well-known model of memory impairment The results showed that subchronic administration of SE led to an improvement of longterm memory of rats. Strong inhibition of AChE and BuChE mRNA transcription in the frontal cortex of rats treated with SE or HU was observed. The BACE1 transcript level was significantly decreased. AChE activity was statistically significantly inhibited in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus by SE (47% and 55%, respectively). Similar effects were observed in the case of HU.

This usage is under scrutiny due to the fact that elevated PSA levels can be caused by other conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and infections of or injury to the prostate. As a result, the identification of specific pathogens capable of increasing serum levels of PSA is important. A potential candidate responsible for elevated PSA is human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). We have reported previously that HHV-8 is capable of infecting and establishing a latent infection in the prostate. In this current study we test the hypothesis that HHV-8 infection is associated with elevated PSA levels. Circulating cytokine levels between men with elevated PSA and controls are also compared. METHODSHHV-8 serostatus was determined among men with elevated serum PSA (4ng/ml; n=168, no prostate cancer on biopsy) and age-matched controls (PSA <4ng/ml; n=234), Circulating cytokine levels were determined among a subset of each group (116 with elevated PSA and 85 controls). RESULTSMen with an elevated serum PSA were significantly more likely to be HHV-8 seropositive (42.9%) than the age-matched cancer-free men (22.2%; OR 2.51; 95%CI 1.48-4.29, P=00001). Comparison of circulating cytokine levels between men with elevated serum PSA and controls indicated that elevated serum PSA is associated with a pro-inflammatory response with a mixed Th1/Th2 response while HHV-8 infection was associated with significantly higher levels of IL12p70, IL-10, and IL-13 indicating a Th2 immune response. CONCLUSIONSWe found a significant association between HHV-8 infection and increased levels of serum PSA. In an age of patient-centered medicine, men with an elevated serum PSA should be considered for HHV-8 serology testing to determine if HHV-8 is responsible for the elevated PSA.

Cellulose paper was modified with paraffin wax to make it waterproof, and afterwards covered by a carbon ink to make it conductive, achieving the goal to make easy and low cost supports, and, in this case, with good detection features. Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) was used herein as target protein. Albumin has an important role in the human body and BSA is normally used as its model protein because of its good stability and low cost. The development of BSA detection systems is important in various fields, such as biochemistry, medicine and pharmacy. Raman measurements were conducted during all preparation stages of the recognition material and electrochemical assays were used to evaluate the analytical performance of the sensor. The assembly of the device was optimized by employing different polymerization timings and monomers of different chemistries and charges. In general, longer polymerization periods and the use of a positively charged monomer benefited the analytical response. The results obtained within different calibrations indicated a linear response over a wide concentration range, from 0.005 to 100 mg/mL of BSA in buffer solution. In addition, the analytical evaluation of the device under several background solutions, including synthetic and real urine, supported the good performance of the sensor and pointed out that the principle of sensor assembly may be extended to other proteins in urine. In addition, the detection capabilities of the device proposed herein are better than other BSA sensing devices relying on electrochemical transduction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Among its primary pharmacologically active components, saikosaponins play a vital role. We investigated the ecophysiological characteristics, accumulation of secondary metabolites, and antioxidant system of wild plants at low light intensity in the forest understory at shady and sunny sites. Compared with plants at sunny sites, plants at the shady site were more abundant, had higher specific leaf area (SLA), a lower maximum electron transport rate (J(max)), higher triose phosphate utilization (TPU), and higher chlorophyll b content (Chlb), but lower net photosynthesis (P-n), root and aboveground biomass, dark respiration rate (R-d), light compensation point (LCP), chlorophyll a to b ratio, carotenoid content, and nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). These features suggest that under low light conditions, the species developed latger leaves to catch more light energy through light -harvesting complex II to increase its photosynthetic efficiency (its ability to use weak light) and photosynthetic electron transport, thereby improving carbon metabolism and survival. The maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II Was about 0.8 at both sites; thus, photoinhibition was not a major problem. Contents of saikosaponins a and d and the total Saikosaponin content (SSa, SSd, and SStotal) were much higher at the shady site, accompanied by increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase(CAT), and peroxidases (POD) activity and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA). This suggested that low light activates antioxidant stress -response pathways, leading to increased SSa, SSd, and SStotal. Our results suggest that B. chinense has strong shade tolerance and would be suitable for cultivation in an agroforestry system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Data Sources: A literature review using PubMed and MEDLINE databases searching hypotension, non-pharmacological therapy, midodrine, droxidopa, pyridostigmine, fludrocortisone, atomoxetine, pseudoephedrine, and octreotide was performed. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Randomized or observational studies, cohorts, case series, or case reports written in English between January 1970 and November 2016 that assessed primary OH treatment in adult patients were evaluated. Data Synthesis: Based on the chosen criteria, it was found that OH patients make up approximately 15% of all syncope patients, predominantly as a result of cardiovascular or neurological insults, or offending medication. Nonpharmacological strategies are the primary treatment, such as discontinuing offending medications, switching medication administration to bedtime, avoiding large carbohydrate-rich meals, limiting alcohol, maintaining adequate hydration, adding salt to diet, and so on. If these fail, pharmacotherapy can help ameliorate symptoms, including midodrine, droxidopa, fludrocortisone, pyridostigmine, atomoxetine, sympathomimetic agents, and octreotide. Conclusions: Midodrine and droxidopa possess the most evidence with respect to increasing blood pressure and alleviating symptoms. Pyridostigmine and fludrocortisone can be used in patients who fail to respond to these agents. Emerging evidence with low-dose atomoxetine is promising, especially in those with central autonomic failure, and may prove to be a viable alternative treatment option. Data surrounding other therapies such as sympathomimetic agents or octreotide are minimal. Medication management of primary OH should be guided by patient-specific factors, such as tolerability, adverse effects, and drug-drug and drug-disease interactions.","Authors":"Hale, GM (Hale, Genevieve M.) ; Valdes, J (Valdes, Jose) ; Brenner, M (Brenner, Michael)","Title":"The Treatment of Primary Orthostatic Hypotension"}]
