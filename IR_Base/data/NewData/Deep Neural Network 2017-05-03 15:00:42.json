However, in recent years, deep learning methods, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), have shown to outperform a number of classification methods in various pattern recognition problems. This work starts by comparing the classification performance of DNN5 against SVMs with a number of feature representations which fall into two categories: cepstral features and time-frequency image features. Unlike related work, the classification performance of the two classifiers is also compared with feature vector combination and the training and evaluation times of the classifiers and features are also compared. The performance is evaluated on an audio surveillance database containing 10 sound classes, each class having multiple subclasses, with the addition of noise at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The experimental results shows that DNNs have a better overall classification performance than SVMs with both individual and combined features and the classification accuracy with DNNs is particularly better at low SNRs. The evaluation time of the DNN classifier was also determined to be the fastest but with a slow training time. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Automatic identification of product information is important for the process management, and localization of SINs in complex scenes is a major challenge for the recognition. A previous rule-based localization algorithm for SINs requires lots of prior knowledge and heuristic tuning for parameters. In this paper, a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is employed to overcome these limitations, and accumulated confidence is proposed to utilize neighboring outputs of the DCNN in a scene. The localization error is remarkably reduced to 1.44% by the proposed algorithm compared to 4.59% in the previous work.

Specifically, the architecture of neural networks is established by embracing hand-crafted features within a data-driven learning framework, incorporating both spatial and temporal information sustained by the video images of the moving heart and giving rise to two strands of two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN). In particular, the acceleration measurement along the time direction at each point is calculated using dense optical flow technique to represent temporal motion information. Subsequently, the fusion of both networks is conducted via linear integrations of the vectors of class scores obtained from each of the two networks. As a result, this architecture maintains the best classification results for eight viewpoint categories of echo videos with 92.1% accuracy rate whereas 89.5% is achieved using only single spatial CNN network. When concerning only three primary locations, 98% of accuracy rate is realised. In addition, comparisons with a number of well-known hand-engineered approaches are also performed, including 2D KAZE, 2D KAZE with Optical Flow, 3D KAZA, Optical Flow, 2D SIFT and 3D SIFT, which delivers accuracy rate of 89.4%, 84.3%, 87.9%, 79.4%, 83.8% and 73.8% respectively.

For most existing fusion methods, either in spatial domain or in a transform domain like wavelet, the activity level measurement is essentially implemented by designing local filters to extract high-frequency details, and the calculated clarity information of different source images are then compared using some elaborately designed rules to obtain a clarity/focus map. Consequently, the focus map contains the integrated clarity information, which is of great significance to various image fusion issues, such as multi-focus image fusion, multi-rhodal image fusion, etc. However, in order to achieve a satisfactory fusion performance, these two tasks are usually difficult to finish. In this study, we address this problem with a deep learning approach, aiming to learn a direct mapping between source images and focus map. To this end, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained by high-quality image patches and their blurred versions is adopted to encode the mapping. The main novelty of this idea is that the activity level measurement and fusion rule can be jointly generated through learning a CNN model, which overcomes the difficulty faced by the existing fusion methods. Based on the above idea, a new multi-focus image fusion method is primarily proposed in this paper. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain state-of-the-art fusion performance in terms of both visual quality and objective assessment. The computational speed of the proposed method using parallel computing is fast enough for practical usage. The potential of the learned CNN model for some other-type image fusion issues is also briefly exhibited in the experiments.

Orienting involves different behaviors, such as approach and avoidance. In the rat, these behaviors are at least partially mapped onto different SC subdomains, the lateral (SCl) and medial (SCm), respectively. To delineate the circuitry involved in the two types of orienting behavior in mice, we injected retrograde tracer into the intermediate and deep layers of the SCm and SCl, and thereby determined the main input structures to these subdomains. Overall the SCm receives larger numbers of afferents compared to the SCl. The prefrontal cingulate area (Cg), visual, oculomotor, and auditory areas provide strong input to the SCm, while prefrontal motor area 2 (M2), and somatosensory areas provide strong input to the SCl. The prefrontal areas Cg and M2 in turn connect to different cortical and subcortical areas, as determined by anterograde tract tracing. Even though connectivity pattern often overlap, our labeling approaches identified segregated neural circuits involving SCm, Cg, secondary visual cortices, auditory areas, and the dysgranular retrospenial cortex likely to be involved in avoidance behaviors.

This is commonly done in an empirical fashion, i. e. with a reference sample of galaxies of known spectroscopic redshift, matched to the source population. In this work, we develop a simple decision tree framework that, under the ideal conditions of a large, purely magnitude-limited reference sample, allows an unbiased recovery of the source redshift probability density function p(z), as a function of magnitude and colour. We use this framework to quantify biases in empirically estimated p( z) caused by selection effects present in realistic reference and weak lensing source catalogues, namely (1) complex selection of reference objects by the targeting strategy and success rate of existing spectroscopic surveys and (2) selection of background sources by the success of object detection and shape measurement at low signal to noise. For intermediate-to-high redshift clusters, and for depths and filter combinations appropriate for ongoing lensing surveys, we find that (1) spectroscopic selection can cause biases above the 10 per cent level, which can be reduced to approximate to 5 per cent by optimal lensing weighting, while (2) selection effects in the shape catalogue bias mass estimates at or below the 2 per cent level. This illustrates the importance of completeness of the reference catalogues for empirical redshift estimation.","Authors":"Gruen, D (Gruen, D.) ; Brimioulle, F (Brimioulle, F.)","Title":"Selection biases in empirical p(z) methods for weak lensing"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397371800010 ISSN: 0031-3203 eISSN: 1873-5142","Keywords":"Facial age estimation; Deep learning; Feature learning; Biometrics KeyWords Plus:DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; REGRESSION; RECOGNITION; FRAMEWORK; PATTERNS; MANIFOLD; IMAGES; NETS","Categories":"Computer Science; Engineering Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Journal Information":"PATTERN RECOGNITION Volume: 66 Pages: 82-94 Special Issue: SI DOI: 10.1016/j.patcog.2016.10.026 Published: JUN 2017","Abstract":"In this paper, we propose a group-aware deep feature learning (GA-DFL) approach for facial age estimation.

Motivated by the fact that age labels are chronologically correlated and the facial aging datasets are usually lack of labeled data for each person in a long range of ages, we split ordinal ages into a set of discrete groups and learn deep feature transformations across age groups to project each face pair into the new feature space, where the intra-group variances of positive face pairs from the training set are minimized and the inter-group variances of negative face pairs are maximized, simultaneously. Moreover, we employ an overlapped coupled learning method to exploit the smoothness for adjacent age groups. To further enhance the discriminative capacity of face representation, we design a multi-path CNN approach to integrate the complementary information from multi-scale perspectives.

Its main difficulty lies in how to design aging features that remain discriminative in spite of large facial appearance variations. Meanwhile, due to the difficulty of collecting and labeling datasets that contain sufficient samples for all possible ages, the age distributions of most benchmark datasets are often imbalanced, which makes this problem more challenge. In this work, we try to solve these difficulties by means of the mainstream deep learning techniques. Specifically, we use a convolutional neural network which can learn discriminative aging features from raw face images without any handcrafting. To combat the sample imbalance problem, we propose a novel cumulative hidden layer which is supervised by a point-wise cumulative signal. With this cumulative hidden layer, our model is learnt indirectly using faces with neighbouring ages and thus alleviate the sample imbalance problem. In order to learn more effective aging features, we further propose a comparative ranking layer which is supervised by a pair-wise comparative signal. This comparative ranking layer facilitates aging feature learning and improves the performance of the main age estimation task. In addition, since one face can be included in many different training pairs, we can make full use of the limited training data. It is noted that both of these two novel layers are differentiable, so our model is end-to-end trainable. Extensive experiments on the two of the largest benchmark datasets show that our deep age estimation model gains notable advantage on accuracy when compared against existing methods.","Authors":"Li, K (Li, Kai) ; Xing, JL (Xing, Junliang) ; Hu, WM (Hu, Weiming) ; Maybank, SJ (Maybank, Stephen J.)","Title":"D2C: Deep cumulatively and comparatively learning for human age estimation"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397371800021 ISSN: 0031-3203 eISSN: 1873-5142","Keywords":"Change detection; Information unbalanced images; Deep neural networks; Feature representation; Feature mapping KeyWords Plus:UNSUPERVISED CHANGE DETECTION; MULTITEMPORAL SAR IMAGES; URBAN CHANGE DETECTION; REMOTE-SENSING IMAGES; HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; ALGORITHMS; CRITERION; FRAMEWORK; FUSION","Categories":"Computer Science; Engineering Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Journal Information":"PATTERN RECOGNITION Volume: 66 Pages: 213-228 Special Issue: SI DOI: 10.1016/j.patcog.2017.01.002 Published: JUN 2017","Abstract":"This paper mainly introduces a novel deep learning and mapping (DLM) framework oriented to the ternary change detection task for information unbalanced images.

First, the stacked denoising autoencoder is used on two images, serving as a feature extractor. Then after a sample selection process, the stacked mapping network is employed to obtain the mapping functions, establishing the relationship between the features for each class. Finally, a comparison between the features is made and the final ternary map is generated through the clustering of the comparison result. This work is highlighted by two aspects. Firstly, previous works focus on two images with similar properties, whereas the DLM framework is based on two images with quite different properties, which is a usually encountered case. Secondly, the DLM framework is based on the analysis of feature instead of superficial intensity, which avoids the corruptions of unbalanced information to a large extent.

Among the existing approaches to detecting choroidal boundaries, graph-searching based techniques belong to the state-of-the-art. However, most of these techniques rely on hand-crafted models on the graph-edge weight and their performances are limited mainly due to the weak choroidal boundaries, textural structure of the choroid, inhomogeneity of the textural structure of the choroid and great variation of the choroidal thickness. In order to circumvent this limitation, we present a multi-scale and end-to-end convolutional network architecture where an optimal graph-edge weight can be learned directly from raw pixels. Our method operates on multiple scales and combines local and global information from the 2D OCT image. Experimental results obtained based on 912 OCT B-scans show that our learned graph-edge weights outperform conventional hand-crafted ones and behave robustly and accurately no matter the OCT image is from normal subjects or patients for whom significant retinal structure variations can be observed.","Authors":"Sui, XD (Sui, Xiaodan) ; Zheng, YJ (Zheng, Yuanjie) ; Wei, BZ (Wei, Benzheng) ; Bi, HS (Bi, Hongsheng) ; Wu, JF (Wu, Jianfeng) ; Pan, XM (Pan, Xuemei) ; Yin, YL (Yin, Yilong) ; Zhang, ST (Zhang, Shaoting)","Title":"Choroid segmentation from Optical Coherence Tomography with graph edge weights learned from deep convolutional neural networks"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396952300018 ISSN: 0925-2312 eISSN: 1872-8286","Keywords":"Chinese anthroposcopy; Chinese face reading; Facial attribute estimation; Deep convolutional neural networks; Facial region pooling layer","Categories":"Computer Science Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence","Journal Information":"NEUROCOMPUTING Volume: 236 Pages: 153-163 Special Issue: SI DOI: 10.1016/j.neucom.2016.09.110 Published: MAY 2 2017","Abstract":"Chinese face reading has demonstrated the often satisfying capabilities to tell the characteristics (mostly exaggerated as fortune) of a person by reading his/her face, i.e. understanding the fine-grained facial attributes (e.g., length of nose, single/double-fold eyelid, density of eyebrows, etc.). Thus, a smart face reading system should estimate the fine-grained facial attributes well. Therefore, In this paper, we first study the fine-grained facial attribute estimation problem and propose a novel deep convolutional network equipped with a new facial region pooling layer (called FRP-net), to accurately estimate the fine-grained facial attributes. To capture the characteristics of fine-grained facial attributes, the embedded FRP layer implements the pooling operation on the searched facial region windows (locates the region of each facial attribute) instead of the commonly-used sliding windows. Further, we push the proposed fine-grained facial attribute estimation method into the face reading problem and present a computational face reader system to automatically infer the characteristics of a person based on his/her face. For example, it can estimate the attractive and easy-going characteristics of a Chinese person from his/her big eyes according to the Chinese anthroposcopy literature.

These IPTs are primarily used to manipulate images to extract defect features, such as cracks in concrete and steel surfaces. However, the extensively varying real-world situations (e.g., lighting and shadow changes) can lead to challenges to the wide adoption of IPTs. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a vision-based method using a deep architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting concrete cracks without calculating the defect features. As CNNs are capable of learning image features automatically, the proposed method works without the conjugation of IPTs for extracting features. The designed CNN is trained on 40 K images of 256 x 256 pixel resolutions and, consequently, records with about 98% accuracy. The trained CNN is combined with a sliding window technique to scan any image size larger than 256 x 256 pixel resolutions. The robustness and adaptability of the proposed approach are tested on 55 images of 5,888 x 3,584 pixel resolutions taken from a different structure which is not used for training and validation processes under various conditions (e.g., strong light spot, shadows, and very thin cracks). Comparative studies are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed CNN using traditional Canny and Sobel edge detection methods. The results show that the proposed method shows quite better performances and can indeed find concrete cracks in realistic situations.","Authors":"Cha, YJ (Cha, Young-Jin) ; Choi, W (Choi, Wooram) ; Buyukozturk, O (Buyukozturk, Oral)","Title":"Deep Learning-Based Crack Damage Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398535900014 ISSN: 0887-3801 eISSN: 1943-5487","Keywords":"Surveillance; Aerial camera arrays; Data collection; Vehicle tracking; Vehicle detection; Computer vision; Speeded up robust features (SURF); Deep learning; Convolutional neural network","Categories":"Computer Science; Engineering Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Civil","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING Volume: 31 Issue: 3 Article Number: 04016072 DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000646 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"The paper presents a novel computer vision-based traffic surveillance system capable of processing aerial imagery to track vehicles and their movements.

In this scenario, Hoeffding Trees are an established method for classification. Several extensions exist, including high performing ensemble setups such as online and leveraging bagging. Also, k-nearest neighbors is a popular choice, with most extensions dealing with the inherent performance limitations over a potentially-infinite stream. At the same time, gradient descent methods are becoming increasingly popular, owing in part to the successes of deep learning. Although deep neural networks can learn incrementally, they have so far proved too sensitive to hyper-parameter options and initial conditions to be considered an effective 'off -the-shelf' data-streams solution. In this work, we look at combinations of Hoeffding-trees, nearest neighbor, and gradient descent methods with a streaming preprocessing approach in the form of a random feature functions filter for additional predictive power. We further extend the investigation to implementing methods on GPUs, which we test on some large real-world datasets, and show the benefits of using GPUs for data-stream learning due to their high scalability. Our empirical evaluation yields positive results for the novel approaches that we experiment with, highlighting important issues, and shed light on promising future directions in approaches to data-stream classification.

A robot with tool-use skills can be useful in human robot symbiosis because this allows the robot to expand its task performing abilities. Past studies that included tool-body assimilation approaches were mainly focused on obtaining the functions of the tools, and demonstrated the robot starting its motions with a tool pre-attached to the robot. This implies that the robot would not be able to decide whether and where to grasp the tool. In real life environments, robots would need to consider the possibilities of tool grasping positions, and then grasp the tool. To address these issues, the robot performs motor babbling by grasping and nongrasping the tools to learn the robot's body model and tool functions. In addition, the robot grasps various parts of the tools to learn different tool functions from different grasping positions. The motion experiences are learned using deep learning. In model evaluation, the robot manipulates an object task without tools, and with several tools of different shapes. The robot generates motions after being shown the initial state and a target image, by deciding whether and where to grasp the tool. Therefore, the robot is capable of generating the correct motion and grasping decision when the initial state and a target image are provided to the robot. (C) 2017 The Authors.

It typically involves two procedures of non-linear feature extractions against dramatic appearance changes, and subsequent discriminative analysis in order to reduce intra-personal variations while enlarging inter-personal differences. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid deep architecture which combines Fisher vectors and deep neural networks to learn non-linear transformations of pedestrian images to a deep space where data can be linearly separable. The proposed method starts from Fisher vector encoding which computes a sequence of local feature extraction, aggregation, and encoding. The resulting Fisher vector output are fed into stacked supervised layer to seek non-linear transformation into a deep space. On top of the deep neural network, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is reinforced such that linearly separable latent representations can be learned in an end-to-end fashion. By optimizing an objective function modified from LDA, the network is enforced to produce feature distributions which have a low variance within the same class and high variance between classes. The objective is essentially derived from the general LDA eigenvalue problem and allows to train the network with Stochastic Gradient Descent and back-propagate LDA gradients to compute Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) gradients in Fisher vector encoding. For empirical evaluations, we test our approach on four benchmark data sets in person re-identification (VIPeR [1], CUHK03 [2], CUHK01 [3], and Market 1501 [4]).

This paper proposes a new framework to efficiently and accurately match periocular images that are automatically acquired under less-constrained environments. Our framework, referred to as semantics-assisted convolutional neural networks (SCNNs) in this paper, incorporates explicit semantic information to automatically recover comprehensive periocular features. This strategy enables superior matching accuracy with the usage of relatively smaller number of training samples, which is often an issue with several biometrics. Our reproducible experimental results on four different publicly available databases suggest that the SCNN-based periocular recognition approach can achieve outperforming results, both in achievable accuracy and matching time, for less-constrained periocular matching. Additional experimental results presented in this paper also indicate that the effectiveness of proposed SCNN architecture is not only limited to periocular recognition but it can also be useful for generalized image classification. Without increasing the volume of training data, the SCNN is able to automatically extract more discriminative features from the input data than a single CNN, therefore can consistently improve the recognition performance.

However, most of feature extraction methods are hand-designed and usually can not achieve a satisfactory performance.

Specifically, we learn episodic features (containing the key components and their spatial relations) and semantic features (i.e., semantic descriptions of the key components) which are two important types of features for the human cognition process.

Traditional sentence-level sentiment classification research focuses on one-technique-fits-all solution or only centers on one special type of sentences. In this paper, we propose a divide-and-conquer approach which first classifies sentences into different types, then performs sentiment analysis separately on sentences from each type. Specifically, we find that sentences tend to be more complex if they contain more sentiment targets. Thus, we propose to first apply a neural network based sequence model to classify opinionated sentences into three types according to the number of targets appeared in a sentence. Each group of sentences is then fed into a one-dimensional convolutional neural network separately for sentiment classification. Our approach has been evaluated on four sentiment classification datasets and compared with a wide range of baselines. Experimental results show that: (1) sentence type classification can improve the performance of sentence-level sentiment analysis; (2) the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarking datasets.

In a cohort of 71 breast tumour resection samples, automated scoring showed a concordance of 83% with a pathologist. The twelve discordant cases were then independently reviewed, leading to a modification of diagnosis from initial pathologist assessment for eight cases.

The gradient-descent algorithm such as backpropagation has been widely applied to optimite the FNNs. Its success is evident from the FNN's application to numerous real-world problems.

In this framework, it is essential to find informative acoustic features that provide effective cues for Wiener-filter estimation. In this study, we measured the informativeness of acoustic features using mutual information between acoustic features and supervised Wiener-filter parameters, e.g., prior signal-to-noise ratios, and developed a method for automatically selecting informative acoustic features from a large number of feature candidates. To automatically select optimum features, we derived a differentiable objective function in proportion to mutual information based on the kernel method. Since the higher order correlations between acoustic features and Wiener-filter parameters are calculated using the kernel method, the statistical dependence of these variables is accurately calculated; thus, only meaningful acoustic features are selected. Through several experiments conducted on a mock sports field, we confirmed that the signal-to-distortion ratio score improved when various types of target sources were surrounded by loud cheering noise.","Authors":"Koizumi, Y (Koizumi, Yuma) ; Niwa, K (Niwa, Kenta) ; Hioka, Y (Hioka, Yusuke) ; Kobayashi, K (Kobayashi, Kazunori) ; Ohmuro, H (Ohmuro, Hitoshi)","Title":"Informative Acoustic Feature Selection to Maximize Mutual Information for Collecting Target Sources"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398178600008 ISSN: 2329-9290","Keywords":"Deep learning; deep neural network; deep belief network; i-vector; speaker recognition KeyWords Plus:NEURAL-NETWORKS; SPEECH RECOGNITION; VERIFICATION","Categories":"Acoustics; Engineering Web of Science Categories:Acoustics; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Journal Information":"IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING Volume: 25 Issue: 4 Pages: 807-817 DOI: 10.1109/TASLP.2017.2661705 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"The lack of labeled background data makes a big performance gap between cosine and Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) scoring baseline techniques for i-vectors in speaker recognition.

This work focuses on approaches that allow for rapid and robust adaptation of such models. First, i-vectors are added to the DNN input as speaker-informed features. An informative prior is introduced to i-vector estimation to improve the robustness to limited adaptation data. I-vectors are then combined with a structured adaptive DNN, the multibasis adaptive neural network (MBANN), and the complementarity of these adaptation techniques is investigated. Moreover, i-vectors are used to predict the MBANN transforms, avoiding the initial decoding pass and alignment. These approaches are evaluated on a U.S. English Broadcast News (BN) transcription task with two distinct sets of test data. The first, from the BN task and BN-style Youtube videos, yields test data acoustically matched to the training data, while the second set is from acoustically mismatched Youtube videos of diverse context. The performance gains from these schemes are found to be sensitive to the level of mismatch between training and test sets. The MBANN system combined with i-vector input achieves best performance for BN test sets. The i-vector-based predictive MBANN scheme is proven to be more robust to acoustically mismatched conditions and outperforms the other adaptation schemes in such scenarios.","Authors":"Karanasou, P (Karanasou, Penny) ; Wu, CY (Wu, Chunyang) ; Gales, M (Gales, Mark) ; Woodland, PC (Woodland, Philip C.)","Title":"I-Vectors and Structured Neural Networks for Rapid Adaptation of Acoustic Models"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398178600014 ISSN: 2329-9290","Keywords":"CFSMN; Deep neural networks; feedforward sequential memory networks; language modeling; speech recognition KeyWords Plus:SPEECH RECOGNITION; NETWORKS; TIME; ERROR; MODEL","Categories":"Acoustics; Engineering Web of Science Categories:Acoustics; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Journal Information":"IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING Volume: 25 Issue: 4 Pages: 871-884 DOI: 10.1109/TASLP.2017.2672398 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel neural network structure, namely feedforward sequential memory networks (FSMN), to model long-term dependence in time series without using recurrent feedback.

The memory blocks use a tapped-delay line structure to encode the long context information into a fixed-size representation as short-term memory mechanism which are somehow similar to the time-delay neural networks layers. We have evaluated the FSMNs in several standard benchmark tasks, including speech recognition and language modeling. Experimental results have shown that FSMNs outperform the conventional recurrent neural networks (RNN) while can be learned much more reliably and faster in modeling sequential signals like speech or language. Moreover, we also propose a compact feedforward sequential memory networks (cFSMN) by combining FSMN with low-rank matrix factorization and make a slight modification to the encoding method used in FSMNs in order to further simplify the network architecture. On the speech recognition Switchboard task, the proposed cFSMN structures can reduce the model size by 60% and speed up the learning by more than seven times while the model can still significantly outperform the popular bidirectional LSTMs for both frame-level cross-entropy criterion-based training and MMI-based sequence training.","Authors":"Zhang, SL (Zhang, Shiliang) ; Liu, C (Liu, Cong) ; Jiang, H (Jiang, Hui) ; Wei, S (Wei, Si) ; Dai, LR (Dai, Lirong) ; Hu, Y (Hu, Yu)","Title":"Nonrecurrent Neural Structure for Long-Term Dependence"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395932300005 ISSN: 1070-9908 eISSN: 1558-2361","Keywords":"Automatic speech recognition (ASR); Aurora-4; channelmismatch; deep neural network (DNN); locally normalized filter bank (LNFB)","Categories":"Engineering Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Journal Information":"IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS Volume: 24 Issue: 4 Pages: 377-381 DOI: 10.1109/LSP.2017.2661699 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"This letter describes modifications to locally normalized filter banks (LNFB), which substantially improve their performance on the Aurora-4 robust speech recognition task using a Deep Neural Network-Hidden Markov Model (DNN-HMM)based speech recognition system. The modified coefficients, referred to as LNFB features, are a filter-bank version of locally normalized cepstral coefficients (LNCC), which have been described previously. The ability of the LNFB features is enhanced through the use of newly proposed dynamic versions of them, which are developed using an approach that differs somewhat from the traditional development of delta and delta-delta features. Further enhancements are obtained through the use of mean normalization and mean-variance normalization, which is evaluated both on a per-speaker and a per-utterance basis. The best performing feature combination (typically LNFB combined with LNFB delta and delta-delta features and mean-variance normalization) provides an average relative reduction in word error rate of 11.4% and 9.4%, respectively, compared to comparable features derived from Mel filter banks when clean and multinoise training are used for the Aurora-4 evaluation.

Layer 5 is known to have a major role in generating the recurrent activation associated with these functions, but relatively little is known about its intrinsic dynamics at the mesoscopic level of large numbers of neighboring neurons. Using calcium imaging, we measured the spontaneous activity of networks of deep-layer medial prefrontal cortical neurons in an acute slice model. Inferring the simultaneous activity of tens of neighboring neurons, we found that while the majority showed only sporadic activity, a subset of neurons engaged in sustained delta frequency rhythmic activity. Spontaneous activity under baseline conditions was weakly correlated between pairs of neurons, and rhythmic neurons showed little coherence in their oscillations. However, we consistently observed brief bouts of highly synchronous activity that must be attributed to network activity. NMDA-mediated stimulation enhanced rhythmicity, synchrony, and correlation within these local networks. These results characterize spontaneous prefrontal activity at a previously unexplored spatio-temporal scale and suggest that medial prefrontal cortex can act as an intrinsic generator of delta oscillations. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Using calcium imaging and a novel analytic framework, we characterized the spontaneous and NMDA-evoked activity of layer 5 prefrontal cortex at a largely unexplored spatiotemporal scale.

Of various machine-learning techniques, sparse regression models have proved their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data but with a small number of training samples, especially in medical problems. In the meantime, deep learning methods have been making great successes by outperforming the state-of-the-art performances in various applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines the two conceptually different methods of sparse regression and deep learning for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment diagnosis and prognosis. Specifically, we first train multiple sparse regression models, each of which is trained with different values of a regularization control parameter. Thus, our multiple sparse regression models potentially select different feature subsets from the original feature set; thereby they have different powers to predict the response values, i.e., clinical label and clinical scores in our work. By regarding the response values from our sparse regression models as target-level representations, we then build a deep convolutional neural network for clinical decision making, which thus we call 'Deep Ensemble Sparse Regression Network.' To our best knowledge, this is the first work that combines sparse regression models with deep neural network. In our experiments with the ADNI cohort, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving the highest diagnostic accuracies in three classification tasks.

This is a long standing problem due to low signal-tonoise ratio in the visualisation of breast masses, combined with their large variability in terms of shape, size, appearance and location. We break the problem down into three stages: mass detection, mass segmentation, and mass classification. For the detection, we propose a cascade of deep learning methods to select hypotheses that are refined based on Bayesian optimisation. For the segmentation, we propose the use of deep structured output learning that is subsequently refined by a level set method. Finally, for the classification, we propose the use of a deep learning classifier, which is pre-trained with a regression to hand-crafted feature values and fine-tuned based on the annotations of the breast mass classification dataset. We test our proposed system on the publicly available INbreast dataset and compare the results with the current state-of-the-art methodologies. This evaluation shows that our system detects 90% of masses at 1 false positive per image, has a segmentation accuracy of around 0.85 (Dice index) on the correctly detected masses, and overall classifies masses as malignant or benign with sensitivity (Se) of 0.98 and specificity (Sp) of 0.7.

An increase in beta oscillations (12-35 Hz) within the basal ganglia (BG) nuclei does not proliferate throughout the cortico-basal ganglia loop in uniform fashion; rather it can be subdivided into two distinct frequency bands, i.e. the lower beta (12-20 Hz) and upper beta (21-35 Hz). A computational model of the excitatory and inhibitory neural network that focuses on the population properties is proposed to explore the mechanism underlying the pathological beta oscillations. Simulation results show several findings. The upper beta frequency in the BG originates from a high frequency cortical beta, while the emergence of exaggerated lower beta frequency in the BG depends greatly on the enhanced excitation of a reciprocal network consisting of the globus pallidus externus (GPe) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). There is also a transition mechanism between the upper and lower beta oscillatory activities, and we explore the impact of self-inhibition within the GPe on the relationship between the upper beta and lower beta oscillations. It is shown that increased self-inhibition within the GPe contributes to increased upper beta oscillations driven by the cortical rhythm, while decrease in the self-inhibition within the GPe facilitates an enhancement of the lower beta oscillations induced by the increased excitability of the BG. This work provides an analysis for understanding the mechanism underlying pathological synchronization in neurological diseases. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Deep convolutional neural networks (DNN) are able to learn and take advantage of local spatial correlations required for this task. They are, however, restricted by their small, fixed-sized filters, which limits their ability to learn long-range dependencies. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), on the other hand, do not suffer from this restriction. Their iterative interpretation allows them to model long-range dependencies by propagating activity. This property is especially useful when labeling video sequences, where both spatial and temporal long-range dependencies occur. In this work, a novel RNN architecture for object class segmentation is presented. We investigate several ways to train such a network. We evaluate our models on the challenging NYU Depth v2 dataset for object class segmentation and obtain competitive results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, an advanced SWE retrieval algorithm based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method was developed. This method samples the posterior multiple-layer snow properties according to the likelihood of the brightness temperature (TB) simulation with the actual TB observations. The Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks with improved Born approximation (MEMLS-IBA) was used as the observation model. Using a globally applicable method to produce prior estimates of snow properties, the retrieval approach is called the Bayesian Algorithm for SWE Estimation with Passive Microwave measurements (BASE-PM), and was applied on 48 snowpits at Sodanlcyla, Finland; Churchill, Canada and Colorado, US. The result shows that the root mean squared (RMS) error of the retrieved SWE is 42.7 mm excluding two outliers, and is 30.8 mm if the outliers as well as six deep snowpits from Colorado are excluded. This accuracy approximately meets the 30-mm requirement of Integrated Global Observing Strategy for shallow snow. The poor performance for the outlier and deep snowpits is explained. Additional experiments using more accurate priors show that SWE retrieval accuracy can be improved with local snowcover knowledge, e.g. if historical snowpit measurements or snow process model simulations are available.

Both of these techniques involve the computation of posterior probabilities, using either Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) or Deep Neural Networks (DNN), as a prior step to estimating i-vectors or speaker factors. GMMs focus on implicitly modeling phonetic information of acoustic features while DNNs focus on explicitly modeling phonetic/linguistic units. For text-dependent speaker verification, DNN-based systems have considerably outperformed GMM for fixed-phrase tasks. However, both approaches ignore phone sequence information. In this paper, we aim at exploiting this information by using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with speaker-informative features. These features are obtained from i-vector models extracted over short speech segments, also called online i-vectors. Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) is further used to project online i-vectors onto a speaker-discriminative subspace.

Experiment results show that proposed methods could estimate small bowel contraction frequency correctly. The difference between predicted diameter lengths and one manually labeled is within reasonable range, and estimated frequency is close to the groundtruth.

In this magnitude range, there are no known ambiguities in the colour-redshift map, consistent with a small rate of redshift outliers. In the fainter regime, the KDE method produces p(z) estimates per galaxy that represent unbiased and accurate redshift frequency expectations.

However, the supervised deep models like convolutional neural network require large quantities of labeled data, which are very expensive to obtain. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an unsupervised deep network, called the stacked convolutional denoising auto-encoders, which can map images to hierarchical representations without any label information. The network, optimized by layer-wise training, is constructed by stacking layers of denoising autoencoders in a convolutional way. In each layer, high dimensional feature maps are generated by convolving features of the lower layer with kernels learned by a denoising auto-encoder. The autoencoder is trained on patches extracted from feature maps in the lower layer to learn robust feature detectors. To better train the large network, a layer-wise whitening technique is introduced into the model. Before each convolutional layer, a whitening layer is embedded to sphere the input data. By layers of mapping, raw images are transformed into high-level feature representations which would boost the performance of the subsequent support vector machine classifier.

In order to extract spatial features, a multiscale patch-based feature extraction model that consists of gray level-gradient co-occurrence matrix, Gabor, and histogram of oriented gradient descriptors is developed to obtain primitive features from the SAR image. Then, to get discriminative representation of initial features, the DSCNN network that comprises four layers of supervised and contractive autoencoders is proposed to optimize features for classification. The supervised penalty of the DSCNN can capture the relevant information between features and labels, and the contractive restriction aims to enhance the locally invariant and robustness of the encoding representation. Consequently, the DSCNN is able to produce effective representation of sample features and provide superb predictions of the class labels. Moreover, to restrain the influence of speckle noises, a graph-cut-based spatial regularization is adopted after classification to suppress misclassified pixels and smooth the results. Experiments on three SAR data sets demonstrate that the proposed method is able to yield superior classification performance compared with some related approaches.","Authors":"Geng, J (Geng, Jie) ; Wang, HY (Wang, Hongyu) ; Fan, JC (Fan, Jianchao) ; Ma, XR (Ma, Xiaorui)","Title":"Deep Supervised and Contractive Neural Network for SAR Image Classification"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396395500006 ISSN: 1520-9210 eISSN: 1941-0077","Keywords":"Color space; machine learning; skin detection; stacked autoencoders KeyWords Plus:NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; MODELS","Categories":"Computer Science; Telecommunications Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Telecommunications","Journal Information":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA Volume: 16 Issue: 4 Pages: 740-749 DOI: 10.1109/TMM.2016.2638204 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"A good skin detector that is capable of capturing skin tones under different conditions is important for human-machine interaction applications. In a general situation, skin detectors, such as skin probability maps or Gaussian mixture models, achieve acceptable skin segmentation results. However, the false positive rate increases significantly when the skin tones are in shadow or when skin-like background objects are under similar illumination. In this paper, we propose a novel skin feature learning algorithm based on stacked autoencoders, which are deep neural networks. To overcome the problems encountered in skin segmentation that are caused by different ethnicities and varying illumination conditions, the stacked autoencoders are utilized to learn more discriminative representations of the skin area in both the RGB color space and the HSV color space. Unlike traditional machine learning methods, instead of predicting each pixel individually, our algorithm utilizes blocks to learn the representations and detect the skin areas. The algorithm exploits the learning ability of deep neural networks to learn high-level representations of skin tones. Experiments on test images show that the proposed algorithm achieves acceptable results on several publicly available data sets. To reduce the difficulty of detecting skin pixels in these data sets, the ground truths of these data sets are commonly focused on foreground skin area detection. Our skin detector is also able to detect background areas, as shown in our experiments.","Authors":"Lei, Y (Lei, You) ; Yuan, W (Yuan, Wang) ; Wang, HP (Wang, Hongpeng) ; You, WH (You Wenhu) ; Bo, W (Bo, Wu)","Title":"A Skin Segmentation Algorithm Based on Stacked Autoencoders"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396395500017 ISSN: 1520-9210 eISSN: 1941-0077","Keywords":"Convolutional neural network; indoor localization; magnetic field; particle filter; visual image KeyWords Plus:NEURAL-NETWORKS; LOCATION; RECOGNITION; PERFORMANCE; NAVIGATION; TRACKING; VISION; DEVICE; SYSTEM","Categories":"Computer Science; Telecommunications Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Telecommunications","Journal Information":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA Volume: 16 Issue: 4 Pages: 874-888 DOI: 10.1109/TMM.2016.2636750 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Accurate and infrastructure-free indoor positioning can be very useful in a variety of applications.

The method is based on an evolving spatiotemporal data machine of evolving spiking neural networks (SNNs) exemplified by the NeuCube architecture [1]. The method consists of several steps: mapping spatial coordinates of fMRI data into a 3-D SNN cube (SNNc) that represents a brain template; input data transformation into trains of spikes; deep, unsupervised learning in the 3-D SNNc of spatiotemporal patterns from data; supervised learning in an evolving SNN classifier; parameter optimization; and 3-D visualization and model interpretation. Two benchmark case study problems and data are used to illustrate the proposed methodology-fMRI data collected from subjects when reading affirmative or negative sentences and another one-on reading a sentence or seeing a picture. The learned connections in the SNNc represent dynamic spatiotemporal relationships derived from the fMRI data. They can reveal new information about the brain functions under different conditions. The proposed methodology allows for the first time to analyze dynamic functional and structural connectivity of a learned SNN model from fMRI data. This can be used for a better understanding of brain activities and also for online generation of appropriate neurofeedback to subjects for improved brain functions. For example, in this paper, tracing the 3-D SNN model connectivity enabled us for the first time to capture prominent brain functional pathways evoked in language comprehension. We found stronger spatiotemporal interaction between left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left temporal while reading a negated sentence. This observation is obviously distinguishable from the patterns generated by either reading affirmative sentences or seeing pictures. The proposed NeuCube-based methodology offers also a superior classification accuracy when compared with traditional AI and statistical methods. The created NeuCube-based models of fMRI data are directly and efficiently implementable on high performance and low energy consumption neuromorphic platforms for real-time applications.","Authors":"Kasabov, NK (Kasabov, Nikola K.) ; Doborjeh, MG (Doborjeh, Maryam Gholami) ; Doborjeh, ZG (Doborjeh, Zohreh Gholami) Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number Kasabov, Nikola  http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4433-7521","Title":"Mapping, Learning, Visualization, Classification, and Understanding of fMRI Data in the NeuCube Evolving Spatiotemporal Data Machine of Spiking Neural Networks"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000393245000015 ISSN: 0020-0255 eISSN: 1872-6291","Keywords":"Deep neural networks; RGB-D data; Feature learning; Performance evaluation KeyWords Plus:OBJECT RECOGNITION; NEURAL-NETWORKS","Categories":"Computer Science Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Information Systems","Journal Information":"INFORMATION SCIENCES Volume: 385 Pages: 266-283 DOI: 10.1016/j.ins.2017.01.013 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Deep Neural Networks for image/video classification have obtained much success in various computer vision applications.

Currently, many deep learning network-related architectures such as deep neural networks (DNNs), convolutional neural network (CNN), wavelet scattering network (ScatNet) and principal component analysis network (PCANet) have been proposed. The most effective network is PCANet, which has achieved promising performance in image classification, such as for face, object and handwritten digit recognition. PCANet can only handle data that are represented by single-view features. In this paper, we present a canonical correlation analysis network (CCANet) to address image classification, in which images are represented by two-view features. The CCANet learns two-view multistage filter banks by a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) method and constructs a cascaded convolutional deep network. Then, we incorporate filters with binaryzation and block-wise histogram processes to form the final depth structure. In addition, we introduce a variation of CCANet dubbed RandNet-2-in which the filter banks are randomly generated. Extensive experiments are conducted using the ETH-80, Yale-B, and USPS databases for object classification, face classification and handwritten digits classification, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the CCANet algorithm is more effective than PCANet, RandNet-1 and RandNet-2. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The neural circuitry mediating reflexive defense reactions has been well-characterized in a variety of species, for example, in rodents and cats, the detection of and species-typical response to threats is mediated by a network of structures including the midbrain tectum (deep and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus [DLSC]), periaqueductal gray (RAG), and forebrain structures such as the amygdala and hypothalamus. However, relatively little is known about the functional architecture of defense circuitry in primates. We have previously reported that pharmacological activation of the DLSC evokes locomotor asymmetry, defense-associated vocalizations, cowering behavior, escape responses, and attack of inanimate objects (Holmes et al., 2012: DesJardin et al., 2013: Forcelli et al., 2016). Here, we sought to determine if pharmacological activation of the PAG would induce a similar profile of responses. We activated the PAG in three awake, behaving macaques by microinfusion of GABA-A receptor antagonist, bicuculline methiodide. Activation of PAG evoked defense-associated vocalizations and postural/locomotor asymmetry, but not motor defense responses (e.g., cowering, escape behavior). These data suggest a partial dissociation between the role of the PAG and the DLSC in the defense network of macaques, but a general conservation of the role of PAG in defense responses across species.","Authors":"Forcelli, PA (Forcelli, Patrick A.) ; Waguespack, HF (Waguespack, Hannah F.) ; Malkova, L (Malkova, Ludise)","Title":"Defensive Vocalizations and Motor Asymmetry Triggered by Disinhibition of the Periaqueductal Gray in Non-human Primates"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000393250300005 ISSN: 0925-2312 eISSN: 1872-8286","Keywords":"Reservoir Computing; Echo State Networks; Intrinsic Plasticity; Deep Neural Encoders; Feature dimensionality reduction; Affective computing KeyWords Plus:INTRINSIC PLASTICITY; CLASSIFICATION","Categories":"Computer Science Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence","Journal Information":"NEUROCOMPUTING Volume: 231 Pages: 28-40 Special Issue: SI DOI: 10.1016/j.neucom.2016.03.108 Published: MAR 29 2017","Abstract":"In this paper we propose a new approach for feature dimensionality reduction based on Reservoir Computing (Echo State Networks).

Here, we focus on the recognition of the action of a human agent based on a biologically inspired visual architecture of analyzing articulated movements. The proposed processing architecture builds upon coarsely segregated streams of sensory processing along different pathways which separately process form and motion information (Layher et al., 2014). Action recognition is performed in an event-based scheme by identifying representations of characteristic pose configurations (key poses) in an image sequence. In line with perceptual studies, key poses are selected unsupervised utilizing a feature-driven criterion which combines extrema in the motion energy with the horizontal and the vertical extendedness of a body shape. Per class representations of key pose frames are learned using a deep convolutional neural network consisting of 15 convolutional layers. The network is trained using the energy-efficient deep neuromorphic networks (Eedn) framework (Esser et al., 2016), which realizes the mapping of the trained synaptic weights onto the IBM Neurosynaptic System platform (Merolla et al., 2014). After the mapping, the trained network achieves real-time capabilities for processing input streams and classify input images at about 1,000 frames per second while the computational stages only consume about 70 mW of energy (without spike transduction). Particularly regarding mobile robotic systems, a low energy profile might be crucial in a variety of application scenarios. Cross-validation results are reported for two different datasets and compared to state-of-the-art action recognition approaches. The results demonstrate, that (I) the presented approach is on par with other key pose based methods described in the literature, which select key pose frames by optimizing classification accuracy, (II) compared to the training on the full set of frames, representations trained on key pose frames result in a higher confidence in class assignments, and (III) key pose representations show promising generalization capabilities in a cross-dataset evaluation.","Authors":"Layher, G (Layher, Georg) ; Brosch, T (Brosch, Tobias) ; Neumann, H (Neumann, Heiko)","Title":"Real-Time Biologically Inspired Action Recognition from Key Poses Using a Neuromorphic Architecture"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396994200001 PubMed ID: 28327593 ISSN: 2045-2322","Categories":"Science & Technology - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:Multidisciplinary Sciences","Journal Information":"SCIENTIFIC REPORTS Volume: 7 Article Number: 45141 DOI: 10.1038/srep45141 Published: MAR 22 2017","Abstract":"The number of people affected by mental illness is on the increase and with it the burden on health and social care use, as well as the loss of both productivity and quality-adjusted life-years.

In this article we argue that unsupervised deep learning represents an important step forward for improving neurocomputational models of perception and cognition, because it emphasizes the role of generative learning as opposed to discriminative (supervised) learning. As a case study, we present a series of simulations investigating the emergence of neural coding of visual space for sensorimotor transformations. We compare different network architectures commonly used as building blocks for unsupervised deep learning by systematically testing the type of receptive fields and gain modulation developed by the hidden neurons. In particular, we compare Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), which are stochastic, generative networks with bidirectional connections trained using contrastive divergence, with autoencoders, which are deterministic networks trained using error backpropagation. For both learning architectures we also explore the role of sparse coding, which has been identified as a fundamental principle of neural computation. The unsupervised models are then compared with supervised, feed-forward networks that learn an explicit mapping between different spatial reference frames. Our simulations show that both architectural and learning constraints strongly influenced the emergent coding of visual space in terms of distribution of tuning functions at the level of single neurons. Unsupervised models, and particularly RBMs, were found to more closely adhere to neurophysiological data from single-cell recordings in the primate parietal cortex.

The need for reliable ground control arises in scenarios where human intervention is necessary, e.g. handover situations when autonomous systems fail. Manual flights are also needed for collecting diverse datasets to train deep neural network-based control systems. This axiom is even more prominent for the case of unmanned flying robots where there is no simple solution to capture optimal navigation footage. In such scenarios, improving the ground control and developing better autonomous systems are two sides of the same coin. To improve the ground control experience, and thus the quality of the footage, we propose to upgrade onboard teleoperation systems to a fully immersive setup that provides operators with a stereoscopic first person view (FPV) through a virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display. We tested users ( n = 7) by asking them to fly our drone on the field. Test flights showed that operators flying our system can take off, fly, and land successfully while wearing VR headsets. In addition, we ran two experiments with prerecorded videos of the flights and walks to a wider set of participants ( n = 69 and n = 20) to compare the proposed technology to the experience provided by current drone FPV solutions that only include monoscopic vision. Our immersive stereoscopic setup enables higher accuracy depth perception, which has clear implications for achieving better teleoperation and unmanned navigation. Our studies show comprehensive data on the impact of motion and simulator sickness in case of stereoscopic setup. We present the device specifications as well as the measures that improve teleoperation experience and reduce induced simulator sickness. Our approach provides higher perception fidelity during flights, which leads to a more precise better teleoperation and ultimately translates into better flight data for training deep UAV control policies.","Authors":"Smolyanskiy, N (Smolyanskiy, Nikolai) ; Gonzalez-Franco, M (Gonzalez-Franco, Mar)","Title":"Stereoscopic First Person View System for Drone Navigation"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396710300001 PubMed ID: 28306716 ISSN: 1932-6203","Categories":"Science & Technology - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:Multidisciplinary Sciences","Journal Information":"PLOS ONE Volume: 12 Issue: 3 Article Number: e0168606 DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0168606 Published: MAR 17 2017","Abstract":"Slit-lamp images play an essential role for diagnosis of pediatric cataracts.

Among them is poor energy efficiency. This situation motivates the investigation of different processing information paradigms, such as the use of spiking neural networks (SNNs), which also introduce cognitive characteristics. As applications at very high scale are addressed, the energy dissipation needs to be minimized. This effort starts from the neuron cell. In this context, this paper presents the design of an original artificial neuron, in standard 65 nm CMOS technology with optimized energy efficiency. The neuron circuit response is designed as an approximation of the Morris-Lecar theoretical model. In order to implement the non-linear gating variables, which control the ionic channel currents, transistors operating in deep subthreshold are employed. Two different circuit variants describing the neuron model equations have been developed. The first one features spike characteristics, which correlate well with a biological neuron model. The second one is a simplification of the first, designed to exhibit higher spiking frequencies, targeting large scale bio-inspired information processing applications. The most important feature of the fabricated circuits is the energy efficiency of a few femtojoules per spike, which improves prior state-of-the-art by two to three orders of magnitude. This performance is achieved by minimizing two key parameters: the supply voltage and the related membrane capacitance. Meanwhile, the obtained standby power at a resting output does not exceed tens of picowatts. The two variants were sized to 200 and 35 mu m(2) with the latter reaching a spiking output frequency of 26 kHz.

While multi-objective optimization itself can be a challenging task, equally difficult is the ability to make sense of the obtained solutions. In this two-part paper, we deal with data mining methods that can be applied to extract knowledge about multi-objective optimization problems from the solutions generated during optimization. This knowledge is expected to provide deeper insights about the problem to the decision maker, in addition to assisting the optimization process in future design iterations through an expert system. The current paper surveys several existing data mining methods and classifies them by methodology and type of knowledge discovered. Most of these methods come from the domain of exploratory data analysis and can be applied to any multivariate data. We specifically look at methods that can generate explicit knowledge in a machine-usable form. A framework for knowledge-driven optimization is proposed, which involves both online and offline elements of knowledge discovery. One of the conclusions of this survey is that while there are a number of data mining methods that can deal with data involving continuous variables, only a few ad hoc methods exist that can provide explicit knowledge when the variables involved are of a discrete nature. Part B of this paper proposes new techniques that can be used with such datasets and applies them to discrete variable multi-objective problems related to production systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The observational time and filter fluxes are used as inputs to the network, but since the inputs are agnostic, additional data such as host galaxy information can also be included. Using the Supernovae Photometric Classification Challenge (SPCC) data, we find that deep networks are capable of learning about light curves, however the performance of the network is highly sensitive to the amount of training data. For a training size of 50% of the representational SPCC data set (around 104 supernovae) we obtain a type-Ia versus non-type-Ia classification accuracy of 94.7%, an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve AUC of 0.986 and an SPCC figure-of-merit F1. =. 0.64. When using only the data for the early-epoch challenge defined by the SPCC, we achieve a classification accuracy of 93.1%, AUC of 0.977, and F-1. =. 0.58, results almost as good as with the whole light curve. By employing bidirectional neural networks, we can acquire impressive classification results between supernovae types I, II and III at an accuracy of 90.4% and AUC of 0.974. We also apply a pre-trained model to obtain classification probabilities as a function of time and show that it can give early indications of supernovae type. Our method is competitive with existing algorithms and has applications for future large-scale photometric surveys.","Authors":"Charnock, T (Charnock, Tom) ; Moss, A (Moss, Adam)","Title":"Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Supernovae Classification"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396091800053 PubMed ID: 28282414 ISSN: 1932-6203","Categories":"Science & Technology - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:Multidisciplinary Sciences","Journal Information":"PLOS ONE Volume: 12 Issue: 3 Article Number: e0173579 DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0173579 Published: MAR 10 2017","Abstract":"People are better at remembering faces from their own race than other races-a phenomenon with significant societal implications. This Other Race Effect (ORE) in memory could arise from different attentional allocation to, and cognitive control over, same-and otherrace faces during encoding. Deeper or more differentiated processing of same-race faces could yield more robust representations of same- vs. other-race faces that could support better recognition memory. Conversely, to the extent that other-race faces may be characterized by lower perceptual expertise, attention and cognitive control may be more important for successful encoding of robust, distinct representations of these stimuli. We tested a mechanistic model in which successful encoding of same- and other-race faces, indexed by subsequent memory performance, is differentially predicted by (a) engagement of frontoparietal networks subserving top-down attention and cognitive control, and (b) interactions between frontoparietal networks and fusiform cortex face processing. European American (EA) and African American (AA) participants underwent fMRI while intentionally encoding EA and AA faces, and similar to 24 hrs later performed an \"old/new\" recognition memory task. Univariate analyses revealed greater engagement of frontoparietal top-down attention and cognitive control networks during encoding for same-vs. other-race faces, stemming particularly from a failure to engage the cognitive control network during processing of other-race faces that were subsequently forgotten. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses further revealed that OREs were characterized by greater functional interaction between medial intraparietal sulcus, a component of the top-down attention network, and fusiform cortex during same-than otherrace face encoding. Together, these results suggest that group-based face memory biases at least partially stem from differential allocation of cognitive control and top-down attention during encoding, such that same-race memory benefits from elevated top-down attentional engagement with face processing regions; conversely, reduced recruitment of cognitive control circuitry appears more predictive of memory failure when encoding out-group faces.","Authors":"Brown, TI (Brown, Thackery I.) ; Uncapher, MR (Uncapher, Melina R.) ; Chow, TE (Chow, Tiffany E.) ; Eberhardt, JL (Eberhardt, Jennifer L.) ; Wagner, AD (Wagner, Anthony D.)","Title":"Cognitive control, attention, and the other race effect in memory"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396091800068 PubMed ID: 28282439 ISSN: 1932-6203","Categories":"Science & Technology - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:Multidisciplinary Sciences","Journal Information":"PLOS ONE Volume: 12 Issue: 3 Article Number: e0173684 DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0173684 Published: MAR 10 2017","Abstract":"The intra-parietal lobe coupled with the Basal Ganglia forms a working memory that demonstrates strong planning capabilities for generating robust yet flexible neuronal sequences. Neurocomputational models however, often fails to control long range neural synchrony in recurrent spiking networks due to spontaneous activity. As a novel framework based on the free-energy principle, we propose to see the problem of spikes' synchrony as an optimization problem of the neurons sub-threshold activity for the generation of long neuronal chains. Using a stochastic gradient descent, a reinforcement signal (presumably dopaminergic) evaluates the quality of one input vector to move the recurrent neural network to a desired activity; depending on the error made, this input vector is strengthened to hill-climb the gradient or elicited to search for another solution. This vector can be learned then by one associative memory as a model of the basal-ganglia to control the recurrent neural network. Experiments on habit learning and on sequence retrieving demonstrate the capabilities of the dual system to generate very long and precise spatio-temporal sequences, above two hundred iterations. Its features are applied then to the sequential planning of arm movements. In line with neurobiological theories, we discuss its relevance for modeling the cortico-basal working memory to initiate flexible goal-directed neuronal chains of causation and its relation to novel architectures such as Deep Networks, Neural Turing Machines and the Free-Energy Principle.","Authors":"Pitti, A (Pitti, Alexandre) ; Gaussier, P (Gaussier, Philippe) ; Quoy, M (Quoy, Mathias)","Title":"Iterative free-energy optimization for recurrent neural networks (INFERNO)"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000393017900018 ISSN: 0925-2312 eISSN: 1872-8286","Keywords":"Image aesthetics; Quality assessment; High aesthetics; Low aesthetics; Image classification; Deep convolutional neural network; GoogLeNet; Feature representation KeyWords Plus:IMAGE QUALITY ASSESSMENT","Categories":"Computer Science Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence","Journal Information":"NEUROCOMPUTING Volume: 228 Pages: 165-175 Special Issue: SI DOI: 10.1016/j.neucom.2016.08.098 Published: MAR 8 2017","Abstract":"In response to the growth of digital photography and its many related applications, researchers have been actively investigating methods for providing automated aesthetical evaluation and classification of photographs. For computational networks to recognize aesthetic qualities, the learning algorithms must be trained using sample sets of characteristics that have known aesthetic values. Traditional methods for developing this training have required manual extraction of aesthetic features for use in the practice datasets. With abundant appearance of convolutional neural networks (CNN), the networks have learned features automatically and have acted as important tools for evaluation and classification. At the time of our research, several existing convolutional neural networks for photograph aesthetical classification only used shallow depth networks, which limit the improvement of performance. In addition, most methods have extracted only one patch as a training sample, such as a down-sized crop from each image. However, a single patch might not represent the entire image accurately, which could cause ambiguity during training. What's more, for existing datasets, the numbers of high quality images of each category are mostly too small to train deep CNN networks. To solve these problems, we introduce a novel photograph aesthetic classifier with a deep and wide CNN for fine granularity aesthetical quality prediction. First, we download a large number of consumer photographic images from DPChallenge.com (a well-known online photography portal) to construct a dataset suitable for aesthetic quality assessment. Then, we zoom out the images into 256x256 by bilinear interpolation and crop 10 patches (Center+four Comers+Flipping). Once we have associated the set with the image's training labels, We feed the images with the bag of patches into the fine-tuned networks. Our proposed computational method is configured to classify the photographs into high and low aesthetic values. A training pattern specifying an output of (0, 1) indicates that the corresponding image belongs to the \"low aesthetic quality\" set. Likewise, a training pattern with an output of (1, 0) indicates that the corresponding image belongs to the \"high aesthetic quality\" set. Experimental results show that the accuracy of classification provided by our method is greater than 87.10%, which is noticeably better than the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, our experiments show that our results are fundamentally consistent with human visual perception and aesthetic judgments.","Authors":"Tan, YL (Tan, Yunlan) ; Tang, PJ (Tang, Pengjie) ; Zhou, YM (Zhou, Yimin) ; Luo, WL (Luo, Wenlang) ; Kang, YP (Kang, Yongping) ; Li, GY (Li, Guangyao)","Title":"Photograph aesthetical evaluation and classification with deep convolutional neural networks"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395561000001 PubMed ID: 28326009 ISSN: 1662-453X","Keywords":"electroencephalography; driver fatigue; autoregressive model; deep belief networks; sparse-deep belief networks KeyWords Plus:NEURAL-NETWORKS; SYSTEM; INTERFACE; TIME; DETERMINANTS; ALGORITHM; WIRELESS; SPECTRUM; FEATURES; FUSION","Categories":"Neurosciences & Neurology Web of Science Categories:Neurosciences","Journal Information":"FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE Volume: 11 Article Number: 103 DOI: 10.3389/fnins.2017.00103 Published: MAR 7 2017","Abstract":"This paper presents an improvement of classification performance for electroencephalography (EEG)-based driver fatigue classification between fatigue and alert states with the data collected from 43 participants. The system employs autoregressive (AR) modeling as the features extraction algorithm, and sparse-deep belief networks (sparse-DBN) as the classification algorithm. Compared to other classifiers, sparse-DBN is a semi supervised learning method which combines unsupervised learning for modeling features in the pre-training layer and supervised learning for classification in the following layer. The sparsity in sparse-DBN is achieved with a regularization term that penalizes a deviation of the expected activation of hidden units from a fixed low-level prevents the network from overfitting and is able to learn low-level structures as well as high-level structures. For comparison, the artificial neural networks (ANN), Bayesian neural networks (BNN), and original deep belief networks (DBN) classifiers are used. The classification results show that using AR feature extractor and DBN classifiers, the classification performance achieves an improved classification performance with a of sensitivity of 90.8%, a specificity of 90.4%, an accuracy of 90.6%, and an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.94 compared to ANN (sensitivity at 80.8%, specificity at 77.8%, accuracy at 79.3% with AUC-ROC of 0.83) and BNN classifiers (sensitivity at 84.3%, specificity at 83%, accuracy at 83.6% with AUROC of 0.87).
