The traditional CGKF for nonlinear systems is usually designed using the local linearization at the operation point of the system, which cannot guarantee the stability and performance globally and is even unsuitable for the system without operation points. To globally ensure the performance, this paper presents a novel CGKF design framework for general nonlinear systems, the key of which includes the single-domain nonlinear filtering and segmentation over domain of interest (DOI). The estimation error system is firstly transformed into a polytopic system through a global linearization procedure, such that the CGKF is formulated by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The prior polytopic linearization of the given nonlinear system is obtained by tensor product (TP) techniques, which is capable of manipulating the polytopic linearization for the conservativeness reduction. Because it is too conservative to share a common filter gain over the whole DOI, the clustering technique is applied to segment the DOI so that the filter can be finalized with multiple gains, each of which corresponds to one specific sub-domain. Finally, the effectiveness of the CGKF is verified by the detailed design example.","Authors":"Liu, XD (Liu, Xiangdong) ; Yu, Y (Yu, Yin) ; Li, Z (Li, Zhen) ; Iu, HHC (Iu, Herbert H.

A common paradigm in tensor-related algorithms advocates unfolding (or flattening) the tensor into a matrix and applying classical methods developed for matrices. Despite the popularity of such techniques, how the functional properties of a tensor changes upon unfolding is currently not well understood. In contrast to the body of existing work which has focused almost exclusively on matricizations, we here consider all possible unfoldings of an order-k tensor, which are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of partitions of {1,, k}. We derive general inequalities between the l(P)-norms of arbitrary unfoldings defined on the partition lattice. In particular, we demonstrate how the spectral norm (p = 2) of a tensor is bounded by that of its unfoldings, and obtain an improved upper bound on the ratio of the Frobenius norm to the spectral norm of an arbitrary tensor. For specially-structured tensors satisfying a generalized definition of orthogonal decomposability, we prove that the spectral norm remains invariant under specific subsets of unfolding operations.

Posture recognition using motion capturing systems shows promising potential in avoiding and minimizing workers' exposure to awkward postures. However, current motion capturing systems require huge computational resources and complicated processes to recognize postures in construction tasks. To address this issue, we proposed an abstract and efficient motion tensor decomposition approach to compress and reorganize the motion data. Together with a multi-classification algorithm, the proposed approach is able to efficiently and accurately differentiate various postures. To validate the approach, we employed a system based on inertial measurement units (IMUs) to examine two sample activities composed of sequencing postures. The results indicate the proposed approach is able to provide sufficient recognition accuracy with less computation power and memory.

The aim of this study was to assess the role of conventional imaging, DTI metrics (p:q tensor decomposition), and DSC perfusion in differentiating tumefactive demyelinating lesions and high-grade gliomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with tumefactive demyelinating lesions and 21 patients with high-grade gliomas underwent brain MR imaging with conventional, DTI, and DSC perfusion imaging. Imaging sequences were assessed for differentiation of the lesions. DTI metrics in the enhancing areas and perilesional hyperintensity were obtained by ROI analysis, and the relative CBV values in enhancing areas were calculated on DSC perfusion imaging. RESULTS: Conventional imaging sequences had a sensitivity of 80.9% and specificity of 57.1% in differentiating high-grade gliomas (P =.049) from tumefactive demyelinating lesions. DTI metrics (p:q tensor decomposition) and DSC perfusion demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the mean values of ADC, the isotropic component of the diffusion tensor, the anisotropic component of the diffusion tensor, the total magnitude of the diffusion tensor, and rCBV among enhancing portions in tumefactive demyelinating lesions and high-grade gliomas (P <=.02), with the highest specificity for ADC, the anisotropic component of the diffusion tensor, and relative CBV (92.9%). Mean fractional anisotropy values showed no significant statistical difference between tumefactive demyelinating lesions and high-grade gliomas. The combination of DTI and DSC parameters improved the diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve = 0.901). Addition of a heterogeneous enhancement pattern to DTI and DSC parameters improved it further (area under the curve = 0.966). The sensitivity increased from 71.4% to 85.7% after the addition of the enhancement pattern. CONCLUSIONS: DTI and DSC perfusion add profoundly to conventional imaging in differentiating tumefactive demyelinating lesions and high-grade gliomas.

Our method takes as input a solid model defined by its triangulated boundary surface. Using cuboid decomposition, an initial polycube approximating the input boundary mesh is built. This polycube serves as the parametric domain of the tensor-product spline representation required for isogeometric analysis. The polycube's nodes and arcs decompose the input model's boundary into quadrilateral patches, and these patches form hexahedral domains. Using aligned global parameterization, the nodes are re-positioned and the arcs are re-routed across the surface in a way to achieve low overall patch distortion, and alignment to principal curvature directions and sharp features. The optimization process is based on one of the main contributions of this paper: a novel way to design cross fields with topological (i.e., imposed singularities) and geometrical (i.e., imposed directions) constraints by solving only sparse linear systems. Based on the optimized polycube and parameterization, compatible B-spline boundary surfaces are reconstructed. Finally, the interior volumetric parameterization is computed using Coon's interpolation. In the context of parametric studies based on geometrical parameters, this method can be used to compute the morphing required for reduced order modeling. For different parametric instances with the same topology but different geometries, this method allows to have the same representation: i.e., meshes (or parameterizations) with the same topology. The efficiency and the robustness of the proposed approach are illustrated by several examples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The work proves the equivalence relations among colorable quad-meshes, finite measured foliations and Strebel differentials on surfaces. This trinity theorem lays down the theoretic foundation for quadrilateral/hexahedral mesh generation, and leads to practical, automatic algorithms. The work proposes the following algorithm: the user inputs a set of disjoint, simple loops on a high genus surface, and specifies a height parameter for each loop; a unique Strebel differential is computed with the combinatorial type and the heights prescribed by the user's input; the Strebel differential assigns a flat metric on the surface and decomposes the surface into cylinders; a colorable quad-mesh is generated by splitting each cylinder into two quadrilaterals, followed by subdivision; the surface cylindrical decomposition is extended inward to produce a solid cylindrical decomposition of the volume; the hexahedral meshing is generated for each volumetric cylinder and then glued together to form a globally consistent hex-mesh.

This map has a global tensor structure, inherited from the parametric spline geometry representation. The use of this global structure in the discretization of partial differential equations may be regarded as a drawback at first glance, as opposed to the purely local nature of (high-order) classical finite elements. In this work we demonstrate that it is possible to exploit the regularity of this structure and to identify the great potential for the efficient implementation of isogeometric discretizations. First, we formulate tensor-product B-spline bases as well as the corresponding mass and stiffness matrices as tensors in order to reveal their intrinsic structure. Second, we derive an algorithm for the separation of variables in the integrands arising in the discretization. This is possible by means of low rank approximation of the integral kernels. We arrive at a compact, separated representation of the integrals. The separated form implies an expression of Galerkin matrices as Kronecker products of matrix factors with small dimensions. This representation is very appealing, due to the reduction in both memory consumption and computation times. Our benchmarks, performed using the C++ library G+Smo, demonstrate that the use of tensor methods in isogeometric analysis possesses significant advantages. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Most of the existing methods perform this task based solely on observed facts. The only requirement is that the learned embeddings should be compatible within each individual fact. In this paper, aiming at further discovering the intrinsic geometric structure of the embedding space, we propose Semantically Smooth Embedding (SSE). The key idea of SSE is to take full advantage of additional semantic information and enforce the embedding space to be semantically smooth, i.e., entities belonging to the same semantic category will lie close to each other in the embedding space. Two manifold learning algorithms Laplacian Eigenmaps and Locally Linear Embedding are used to model the smoothness assumption. Both are formulated as geometrically based regularization terms to constrain the embedding task. Two lines of embedding strategies are tested, i.e., strategies based on latent distance models and strategies based on tensor factorization techniques.

A classical Reynolds decomposition was performed on the resulting velocity fields into a time invariant mean flow and a fluctuating velocity field. This fluctuating velocity field was then further decomposed into coherent and residual/stochastic fluctuations. The statistical distributions of the second and third invariants of the velocity-gradient tensor were then computed at various streamwise locations, along the centreline of the flow and within the shear layers. These invariants were calculated from both the Reynolds-decomposed fluctuating velocity fields and the coherent and stochastic fluctuating velocity fields. The range of spatial locations probed incorporates regions of contrasting flow physics, including a mean recirculation region and separated shear layers, both upstream and downstream of the location of peak turbulence intensity along the centreline. These different flow physics are also reflected in the velocity gradients themselves with different topologies, as characterised by the statistical distributions of the constituent enstrophy and strain-rate invariants, for the three different fluctuating velocity fields. Despite these differing flow physics the ubiquitous self-similar 'tear drop' -shaped joint probability density function between the second and third invariants of the velocity-gradient tensor is observed along the centreline and shear layer when calculated from both the Reynolds decomposed and the stochastic velocity fluctuations. These 'tear drop' -shaped joint probability density functions are not, however, observed when calculated from the coherent velocity fluctuations. This 'tear drop' shape is classically associated with the statistical distribution of the velocity-gradient tensor invariants in fully developed turbulent flows in which there is no coherent dynamics present, and hence spectral peaks at low wavenumbers. The results presented in this manuscript, however, show that such 'tear drops' also exist in spatially developing inhomogeneous turbulent flows. This suggests that the 'tear drop' shape may not just be a universal feature of fully developed turbulence but of turbulent flows in general.","Authors":"Buxton, ORH (Buxton, O. R.

However, nuclear norm, as a convex relaxation of the rank function, can cause the solution deviating from the original solution of low-rank problem. Moreover, equally treating different rank component is not flexible to deal with real applications. In this paper, an efficient reconstruction model is proposed to efficiently reconstruct dynamic MRI. First, we treat dynamic MRI as a 3rd-order tensor, and formulate the low-rankness via non-convex Schatten p-norm of matrices unfolded from the tensor. Secondly, we assign different weight for each rank component in Schatten p-norm. Furthermore, we combine the proposed weighted Schatten p-norm of a tensor as low-rank regularizer, and spatiotemporal total variation as sparse regularizer to formulate the reconstruction model for dynamic MRI. Thirdly, to efficiently solve the formulated reconstruction model, we derive an algorithm based on Bregman iterations with alternating direction multiplier. Over two public data sets of dynamic MRI, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

With the quick increases of data scales and dimensions in the big data era, research challenges arise in order to (1) reflect the dynamics of large tensors while introducing no significant distortions in the factorization procedure and (2) handle influences of the noises in sophisticated applications. A hierarchical parallel processing framework over a GPU cluster, namely H-PARAFAC, has been developed to enable scalable factorization of large tensors upon a \"divide-and-conquer\" theory for Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC). The H-PARAFAC framework incorporates a coarse-grained model for coordinating the processing of sub-tensors and a fine-grained parallel model for computing each sub-tensor and fusing sub-factors. Experimental results indicate that (1) the proposed method breaks the limitation on the scale of multidimensional data to be factorized and dramatically outperforms the traditional counterparts in terms of both scalability and efficiency, e.g., the runtime increases in the order of n(2) when the data volume increases in the order of n(3), (2) H-PARAFAC has potentials in refraining the influences of significant noises, and (3) H-PARAFAC is far superior to the conventional window-based counterparts in preserving the features of multiple modes of large tensors.","Authors":"Chen, D (Chen, Dan) ; Hu, YY (Hu, Yangyang) ; Wang, LZ (Wang, Lizhe) ; Zomaya, AY (Zomaya, Albert Y.) ; Li, XL (Li, Xiaoli)","Title":"H-PARAFAC: Hierarchical Parallel Factor Analysis of Multidimensional Big Data"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395495200009 ISSN: 1051-2004 eISSN: 1095-4333","Keywords":"Fast adaptive PARAFAC; Big data; Parallel computing; Non-negative constraint KeyWords Plus:SUBSPACE TRACKING; ALGORITHMS; COMPONENTS; UNIQUENESS","Categories":"Engineering Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Journal Information":"DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING Volume: 63 Pages: 100-111 DOI: 10.1016/j.dsp.2017.01.006 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"A fast adaptive parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition algorithm is proposed for a class of third order tensors that have one dimension growing linearly with time.

We describe how the QTT decomposition can be used as a hierarchical compression and inversion scheme for matrices arising from the discretization of integral equations. For a broad range of problems, computational and storage costs of the inversion scheme are extremely modest (logN) and once the inverse is computed, it can be applied in Omicron(N log N). We analyze the QTT ranks for hierarchically low rank matrices and discuss its relationship to commonly used hierarchical compression techniques such as FMM and HSS. We prove that the QTT ranks are bounded for translation-invariant systems and argue that this behavior extends to non-translation invariant volume and boundary integrals. For volume integrals, the QTT decomposition provides an efficient direct solver requiring significantly less memory compared to other fast direct solvers. We present results demonstrating the remarkable performance of the QTT-based solver when applied to both translation and non-translation invariant volume integrals in 3D. For boundary integral equations, we demonstrate that using a QTT decomposition to construct preconditioners for a Krylov subspace method leads to an efficient and robust solver with a small memory footprint. We test the QTT preconditioners in the iterative solution of an exterior elliptic boundary value problem (Laplace) formulated as a boundary integral equation in complex, multiply connected geometries.

We demonstrate by various numerical tests that the combination of the diagonal plus low-rank plus reduced-block approximation exhibits higher precision with low numerical cost, providing as well a distinct two-sided error estimate for the smallest eigenvalues of the Bethe-Salpeter operator. The complexity is reduced to O(N-b(2)) in the size of the atomic orbitals basis set, N-b, instead of the practically intractable 0(N-b(2)) scaling for the direct diagonalization. In the second approach, we apply the quantized-TT (QTT) tensor representation to both, the long eigenvectors and the column vectors in the rank-structured BSE matrix blocks, and combine this with the ALS-type iteration in block QTT format. The QTT-rank of the matrix entities possesses almost the same magnitude as the number of occupied orbitals in the molecular systems, No < Nb, hence the overall asymptotic complexity for solving the BSE problem by the QTT approximation is estimated by 0(log(N-0)N-o(2)). We confirm numerically a considerable decrease in computational time for the presented iterative approaches applied to various compact and chain-type molecules, while supporting sufficient accuracy.

In this new framework, tensor is well integrated into the conventional target detection algorithm. As a result, a tensor matched subspace detector (MSD) for hyperspectral target detection is proposed. The proposed method is mainly applied to detect multipixel targets rather than subpixel targets. In this new method, the hyperspectral data are considered as a form of third-order tensor in order to jointly utilize the information of multidimensional data. In conventional detection methods, the spatial-spectral information has not been taken into account, even some algorithms have been presented for improving the utilization efficiency of the spatial-spectral structural feature, but the overall structural characteristic of the extracted feature is still ignored. In our algorithm, the tensor subspace projection is defined for the first time, which is easily calculated by three predetermined orthogonal direction mapping matrices without any iteration. Then, the test tensor blocks are projected into the tensor subspace and finally measured by the ratio of residual energy, just like the general likelihood ratio test. The proposed method can be regarded as an extension of conventional MSD. The reliability and superiority are demonstrated by the experiments on real hyperspectral imaging data sets.

Multidimensional seismic data reconstruction can be viewed as a low-rank matrix or tensor completion problem.

For each frequency slice, we establish a tensor minimization model composed of a low-rank constrained term and a data misfit term. Then we adopt the PSMF algorithm for the recovery of the missing samples. In the PSMF method, we avoid using unbalanced \"long strip\" matrices that result from conventional tensor unfolding. Instead, the tensor is unfolded into almost square or square matrices that are low rank. We also compare the proposed PSMF method with other completion methods.

Most existing video fingerprinting methods use a single feature or concatenate different features to generate video fingerprints, and show good performance under single-mode modifications such as noise addition and blurring. However, when they suffer combined modifications, the performance is degraded to a certain extent because such features cannot characterize the video content completely. By contrast, the assistance and consensus among different features can improve the performance of video fingerprinting. Therefore, in the present study, we mine the assistance and consensus among different features based on a tensor model, and we present a new comprehensive feature to fully use them in the proposed video fingerprinting framework. We also analyze what the comprehensive feature really is for representing the original video. In this framework, the video is initially set as a high-order tensor that consists of different features, and the video tensor is decomposed via the Tucker model with a solution that determines the number of components. Subsequently, the comprehensive feature is generated by the low-order tensor obtained from tensor decomposition. Finally, the video fingerprint is computed using this feature. A matching strategy used for narrowing the search is also proposed based on the core tensor. The robust video fingerprinting framework is resistant not only to single-mode modifications but also to their combination.","Authors":"Nie, XS (Nie, Xiushan) ; Yin, YL (Yin, Yilong) ; Sun, JD (Sun, Jiande) ; Liu, J (Liu, Ju) ; Cui, CR (Cui, Chaoran)","Title":"Comprehensive Feature-Based Robust Video Fingerprinting Using Tensor Model"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000393727300057 ISSN: 0017-9310 eISSN: 1879-2189","Keywords":"Fuzzy uncertainty propagation; Heat conduction; Legendre polynomial series; Collocation technology; Smolyak algorithm KeyWords Plus:FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; BUT-BOUNDED PARAMETERS; INTERVAL-ANALYSIS; DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS; FIELD PREDICTION; ACOUSTIC FIELD; SPARSE GRIDS; OPTIMIZATION","Categories":"Thermodynamics; Engineering; Mechanics Web of Science Categories:Thermodynamics; Engineering, Mechanical; Mechanics","Journal Information":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER Volume: 107 Pages: 631-639 DOI: 10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2016.10.083 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Based on the combination of collocation technology and fuzzy theory, this paper proposes a full grid fuzzy collocation method (FGFCM) and a sparse grid fuzzy collocation method (SGFCM) for fuzzy uncertainty propagation in heat conduction problem.

Is this decomposition unique? Must the number of branches increase with time? These questions are hard to answer because there is no formal definition of branches, and most intuition is based on toy models with arbitrarily preferred degrees of freedom. Here, assuming only the tensor structure associated with spatial locality, I show that branch decompositions are highly constrained just by the requirement that they exhibit redundant local records. The set of all redundantly recorded observables induces a preferred decomposition into simultaneous eigenstates unless their records are highly extended and delicately overlapping, as exemplified by the Shor error-correcting code. A maximum length scale for records is enough to guarantee uniqueness. Speculatively, objective branch decompositions may speed up numerical simulations of nonstationary many-body states, illuminate the thermalization of closed systems, and demote measurement from fundamental primitive in the quantum formalism.","Authors":"Riedel, CJ (Riedel, C.

Our approach is based on a recently proposed tensor algebraic framework where 3-D tensors are treated as linear operators over the set of 2-D tensors. In this framework, one can obtain a factorization for 3-D data, referred to as the tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD), which is similar to the SVD for matrices. t-SVD results in a notion of rank referred to as the tubal-rank. Using this approach we consider the problem of sampling and recovery of 3-D arrays with low tubal-rank. We show that by solving a convex optimization problem, which minimizes a convex surrogate to the tubal-rank, one can guarantee exact recovery with high probability as long as number of samples is of the order O(rnk log(nk)), given a tensor of size n x n x k with tubal-rank r. The conditions under which this result holds are similar to the incoherence conditions for low-rank matrix completion under random sampling. The difference is that we define incoherence under the algebraic setup of t-SVD, which is different from the standard matrix incoherence conditions. We also compare the numerical performance of the proposed algorithm with some state-of-the-art approaches on real-world datasets.","Authors":"Zhang, ZM (Zhang, Zemin) ; Aeron, S (Aeron, Shuchin)","Title":"Exact Tensor Completion Using t-SVD"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396091800007 PubMed ID: 28282379 ISSN: 1932-6203","Categories":"Science & Technology - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:Multidisciplinary Sciences","Journal Information":"PLOS ONE Volume: 12 Issue: 3 Article Number: e0172111 DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0172111 Published: MAR 10 2017","Abstract":"A new methodology based on tensor algebra that uses a higher order singular value decomposition to perform three-dimensional voxel reconstruction from a series of temporal images obtained using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is proposed.

Several SAR imaging schemes have been developed by researchers for improving the imaging quality. For a typical SAR target scenario, the scatterers distribution usually has the feature of structured sparsity. Without considering this feature thoroughly, the existing schemes have still certain drawbacks. The classic matching pursuit algorithms can obtain clearer imaging results, but the cost is resulting in an extreme complexity and a huge computation resource consumption. Therefore, this paper put forward a tensor-based SAR imaging algorithm by means of multiway structured sparsity which makes full use of the above geometrical feature of the scatterers distribution. The spotlight SAR observation signal is formulated as a Tucker model considering the Kronecker constraint, and then a sparse reconstruction algorithm is introduced by utilizing the structured sparsity of the scene. The proposed tensor-based SAR imaging model is able to take advantage of the Kronecker information in each mode, which ensures the robustness for the signal reconstruction. Both the algorithm complexity analysis and numerical simulations show that the proposed method requires less computation than the existing sparsity-driven SAR imaging algorithms. The imaging realizations based on the practical measured data also indicate that the proposed algorithm is superior to the reference methods even in the severe noisy environment, under the condition of multiway structured sparsity.","Authors":"Gao, YF (Gao, Yu-Fei) ; Cong, XC (Cong, Xun-Chao) ; Yang, Y (Yang, Yue) ; Wan, Q (Wan, Qun) ; Gui, G (Gui, Guan)","Title":"A Tensor Decomposition Based Multiway Structured Sparse SAR Imaging Algorithm with Kronecker Constraint"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398818700123 ISSN: 1424-8220","Keywords":"road anomaly detection; path inference; tensor decomposition KeyWords Plus:NAVIGATION","Categories":"Chemistry; Electrochemistry; Instruments & Instrumentation Web of Science Categories:Chemistry, Analytical; Electrochemistry; Instruments & Instrumentation","Journal Information":"SENSORS Volume: 17 Issue: 3 DOI: 10.3390/s17030550 Published: MAR 2017","Abstract":"Road traffic anomaly denotes a road segment that is anomalous in terms of traffic flow of vehicles.

To address these issues, we propose a two-stage solution which consists of two components: a Collaborative Path Inference (CPI) model and a Road Anomaly Test (RAT) model. CPI model performs path inference incorporating both static and dynamic features into a Conditional Random Field (CRF).

Recently tensor decomposition based methods are emerged as powerful and yet generic blind ( i.e. without requiring a knowledge of input characteristics) signal decomposition tool for structural modal identification. In this paper, a tensor decomposition based system identification method is further explored to estimate modal parameters using nonstationary vibration generated due to either earthquake or pedestrian induced excitation in a structure. The effects of lag parameters and sensor densities on tensor decomposition are studied with respect to the extent of nonstationarity of the responses characterized by the stationary duration and peak ground acceleration of the earthquake. A suite of more than 1400 earthquakes is used to investigate the performance of the proposed method under a wide variety of ground motions utilizing both complete and partial measurements of a high-rise building model. Apart from the earthquake, human-induced nonstationary vibration of a real-life pedestrian bridge is also used to verify the accuracy of the proposed method.","Authors":"Friesen, P (Friesen, P.) ; Sadhu, A (Sadhu, A.)","Title":"Performance of tensor decomposition-based modal identification under nonstationary vibration"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397502200013 ISSN: 1081-2865 eISSN: 1741-3028","Keywords":"Multiplicative decomposition; continuum mechanics; finite plasticity; growth mechanics; thermoelasticity KeyWords Plus:ELASTIC-PLASTIC DEFORMATION; FINITE; STRAIN; KINEMATICS; MECHANICS","Categories":"Materials Science; Mathematics; Mechanics Web of Science Categories:Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Mechanics","Journal Information":"MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS OF SOLIDS Volume: 22 Issue: 3 Pages: 528-537 DOI: 10.1177/1081286515598662 Published: MAR 2017","Abstract":"For many purposes in continuum mechanics it has been found useful to decompose the deformation gradient into two factors, which result from some elastic process through which destressing is achieved at a material point.

In this paper, we propose higher order tensor methods to solve the blind spatial signature estimation problem using planar arrays. By assuming that sources' powers vary between successive time blocks, we recast the spatial and spatiotemporal covariance models for the received data as third-order PARATUCK2 and fourth-order Tucker4 tensor decompositions, respectively. Firstly, by exploiting the multilinear algebraic structure of the proposed tensor models, new iterative algorithms are formulated to blindly estimate the spatial signatures. Secondly, in order to achieve a better spatial resolution, we propose an expanded form of spatial smoothing that returns extra spatial dimensions in comparison with the traditional approaches. Additionally, by exploiting the higher-order structure of the resulting expanded tensor model, a multilinear noise reduction preprocessing step is proposed via higher-order singular value decomposition. We show that the increase on the tensor order provides a more efficient denoising, and consequently a better performance compared to existing spatial smoothing techniques. Finally, a solution based on a multi-stage Khatri-Rao factorization procedure is incorporated as the final stage of our proposed estimators. Our results demonstrate that the proposed tensor methods yield more accurate spatial signature estimates than competing approaches while operating in a challenging scenario where the source covariance structure is unknown and arbitrary (non-diagonal), which is actually the case when sample covariances are computed from a limited number of snapshots.

The original NMF-based unmixing algorithm loses the spectral and spatial information between mixed pixels when stacking the spectral responses of the pixels into an observed matrix. Therefore, various constrained NMF methods are developed to impose spectral structure, spatial structure, and spectral-spatial joint structure into NMF to enforce the estimated endmembers and abundances preserve these structures. Compared with matrix format, the third-order tensor is more natural to represent a hyperspectral data cube as a whole, by which the intrinsic structure of hyperspectral imagery can be losslessly retained. Extended from NMF-based methods, a matrix-vector nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) model is proposed in this paper for spectral unmixing. Different from widely used tensor factorization models, such as canonical polyadic decomposition CPD) and Tucker decomposition, the proposed method is derived from block term decomposition, which is a combination of CPD and Tucker decomposition. This leads to a more flexible frame to model various application-dependent problems. The matrix-vector NTF decomposes a third-order tensor into the sum of several component tensors, with each component tensor being the outer product of a vector (endmember) and a matrix (corresponding abundances). From a formal perspective, this tensor decomposition is consistent with linear spectral mixture model. From an informative perspective, the structures within spatial domain, within spectral domain, and cross spectral-spatial domain are retreated interdependently. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has outperformed several state-of-theart NMF-based unmixing methods.","Authors":"Qian, YT (Qian, Yuntao) ; Xiong, FC (Xiong, Fengchao) ; Zeng, S (Zeng, Shan) ; Zhou, J (Zhou, Jun) ; Tang, YY (Tang, Yuan Yan)","Title":"Matrix-Vector Nonnegative Tensor Factorization for Blind Unmixing of Hyperspectral Imagery"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000393753400008 ISSN: 1053-587X eISSN: 1941-0476","Keywords":"Bayesian information criterion (BIC); higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD); minimum description length (MDL); model selection; multilinear tensor rank; Tucker decomposition KeyWords Plus:COLORED NOISE; NUMBER; COMPONENTS; SIGNALS; MODELS; RECONSTRUCTION; APPROXIMATION","Categories":"Engineering Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Journal Information":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING Volume: 65 Issue: 5 Pages: 1196-1206 DOI: 10.1109/TSP.2016.2620965 Published: MAR 1 2017","Abstract":"Model selection in tensor decomposition is important for real applications if the rank of the original data tensor is unknown and the observed tensor is noisy.

In this paper, preliminary investigations in this direction are conducted. While it is clear that the singular values in different matricizations cannot be prescribed completely independent from each other, numerical experiments suggest that sufficiently small, but otherwise arbitrary perturbations preserve feasibility. An alternating projection heuristic is proposed for constructing tensors with prescribed singular values (assuming their feasibility). Regarding the related problem of characterising sets of tensors having the same singular values in specified matricizations, it is noted that orthogonal equivalence under multilinear matrix multiplication is a sufficient condition for two tensors to have the same singular values in all principal, Tucker-type matricizations, but, in contrast to the matrix case, not necessary. An explicit example of this phenomenon is given.","Authors":"Hackbusch, W (Hackbusch, Wolfgang) ; Uschmajew, A (Uschmajew, Andre)","Title":"On the interconnection between the higher-order singular values of real tensors"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000394147600003 ISSN: 0926-6003 eISSN: 1573-2894","Keywords":"Completely positive tensor; Nonnegative decomposition; Truncated moment problem; Semidefinite program KeyWords Plus:TRUNCATED MOMENT PROBLEM; NONNEGATIVE TENSORS; SYMMETRIC TENSORS; OPTIMIZATION; POLYNOMIALS; MATRICES; CONES","Categories":"Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics Web of Science Categories:Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied","Journal Information":"COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS Volume: 66 Issue: 2 Pages: 267-283 DOI: 10.1007/s10589-016-9870-9 Published: MAR 2017","Abstract":"A symmetric tensor, which has a symmetric nonnegative decomposition, is called a completely positive tensor.

Clustering analysis is an effective method to understand the semantic information and interpretable structure of the heterogeneous information networks, and it has attracted the attention of many researchers in recent years. However, most studies assume that heterogeneous information networks usually follow some simple schemas, such as bi-typed networks or star network schema, and they can only cluster one type of object in the network each time. In this paper, a novel clustering framework is proposed based on sparse tensor factorization for heterogeneous information networks, which can cluster multiple types of objects simultaneously in a single pass without any network schema information. The types of objects and the relations between them in the heterogeneous information networks are modeled as a sparse tensor. The clustering issue is modeled as an optimization problem, which is similar to the well-known Tucker decomposition. Then, an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm and a feasible initialization method are proposed to solve the optimization problem. Based on the tensor factorization, we simultaneously partition different types of objects into different clusters. The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets have demonstrated that our proposed clustering framework, STFClus, can model heterogeneous information networks efficiently and can outperform state-of-the-art clustering algorithms as a generally applicable single-pass clustering method for heterogeneous network which is network schema agnostic.","Authors":"Wu, JB (Wu, Jibing) ; Meng, QG (Meng, Qinggang) ; Deng, S (Deng, Su) ; Huang, HB (Huang, Hongbin) ; Wu, YH (Wu, Yahui) ; Badii, A (Badii, Atta)","Title":"Generic, network schema agnostic sparse tensor factorization for single-pass clustering of heterogeneous information networks"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000394471700008 ISSN: 0898-1221 eISSN: 1873-7668","Keywords":"Helmholtz equation; Transparent boundary condition; Tensor product finite element method; FFT KeyWords Plus:PERIODIC SCATTERING PROBLEMS; FAST DIRECT SOLVER; 2ND-HARMONIC GENERATION; ELECTROMAGNETIC SCATTERING; CYLINDERS; SYSTEMS; ARRAYS; LAYERS; WAVES","Categories":"Mathematics Web of Science Categories:Mathematics, Applied","Journal Information":"COMPUTERS & MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS Volume: 73 Issue: 4 Pages: 628-639 DOI: 10.1016/j.camwa.2017.01.002 Published: FEB 15 2017","Abstract":"We consider the diffraction grating problem in optics, which has been modeled by a boundary value problem governed by a Helmholtz equation with transparent boundary conditions.

Separation of these properties is of high importance, since it could allow dMRI to non-invasively probe elongated structures such as neurites (axons and dendrites). However, conventional dMRI, based on single diffusion encoding (SDE), entangles microscopic anisotropy and orientation dispersion with intra-voxel variance in isotropic diffusivity. SDE-based methods for estimating microscopic anisotropy, such as the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) method, must thus rely on model assumptions to disentangle these features. An alternative approach is to directly quantify microscopic anisotropy by the use of variable shape of the b-tensor. Along those lines, we here present the 'constrained diffusional variance decomposition' (CODIVIDE) method, which jointly analyzes data acquired with diffusion encoding applied in a single direction at a time (linear tensor encoding, LTE) and in all directions (spherical tensor encoding, STE). We then contrast the two approaches by comparing neurite density estimated using NODDI with microscopic anisotropy estimated using CODIVIDE. Data were acquired in healthy volunteers and in glioma patients. NODDI and CODIVIDE differed the most in gray matter and in gliomas, where NODDI detected a neurite fraction higher than expected from the level of microscopic diffusion anisotropy found with CODIVIDE. The discrepancies could be explained by the NODDI tortuosity assumption, which enforces a connection between the neurite density and the mean diffusivity of tissue. Our results suggest that this assumption is invalid, which leads to a NODDI neurite density that is inconsistent between LTE and STE data. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the NODDI assumptions result in parameter bias that precludes the use of NODDI to map neurite density. With CODIVIDE, we found high levels of microscopic anisotropy in white matter, intermediate levels in structures such as the thalamus and the putamen, and low levels in the cortex and in gliomas. We conclude that accurate mapping of microscopic anisotropy requires data acquired with variable shape of the b-tensor.","Authors":"Lampinen, B (Lampinen, Bjorn) ; Szczepankiewicz, F (Szczepankiewicz, Filip) ; Martensson, J (Martensson, Johan) ; van Westen, D (van Westen, Danielle) ; Sundgren, PC (Sundgren, Pia C.) ; Nilsson, M (Nilsson, Markus)","Title":"Neurite density imaging versus imaging of microscopic anisotropy in diffusion MRI: A model comparison using spherical tensor encoding"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000391751700001 ISSN: 0264-9381 eISSN: 1361-6382","Keywords":"Petrov type D spacetimes; linear fields; symmetry operators; black holes; spinor methods KeyWords Plus:REST-MASS FIELDS; ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS; GENERAL-RELATIVITY; SPINOR-STRUCTURE; KILLING TENSOR; PERTURBATIONS; TIMES","Categories":"Astronomy & Astrophysics; Physics Web of Science Categories:Astronomy & Astrophysics; Physics, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Particles & Fields","Journal Information":"CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY Volume: 34 Issue: 3 Article Number: 035002 DOI: 10.1088/1361-6382/aa51ff Published: FEB 9 2017","Abstract":"In the class of vacuum Petrov type D spacetimes with cosmological constant, which includes the Kerr-(A) dS black hole as a particular case, we find a set of four-dimensional operators that, when composed off shell with the Dirac, Maxwell and linearized gravity equations, give a system of equations for spin weighted scalars associated with the linear fields, that decouple on shell.

Completing and recovering tensor is an important problem for tensor analysis. It involves recovering a tensor from either a subset of its entries or the whole entries contaminated by noise. Classical tensor completion/recovery methods are based mainly on l(2)-norm (Gaussian distribution noise) models, and are sensitive to noise of large magnitude. While l(1)-norm (Laplacian distribution noise) based methods are robust to noise of large magnitude, they do not deal with dense noise effectively. In this paper, we present a novel Cauchy tensor decomposition method for simultaneously recovering and completing a low rank tensor with both missing data and complex noise. We utilize the Cauchy distribution to model noise and derive the objective function of Cauchy tensor decomposition under the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework. Then we developed a robust tensor decomposition framework that used first-order optimization approaches to optimize the objective function. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted and show that our method is able to successfully recover and complete tensors with large/dense noise and missing data. We further demonstrate the usefulness of Cauchy tensor decomposition on three real-world applications, image inpainting, traffic data process and foreground/background separation.

Solid nitrobenzene (an organic molecular crystal) could be considered as a prototype of energetic material. Up to now, numerous studies have been devoted to crystal structures, spectrum properties and decomposition mechanisms for solid nitrobenzene experimentally and theoretically. However there has been a lack of the comprehensive understanding of the anisotropic characteristics under different loading conditions. Thus we investigate the hydrostatic and uniaxial compressions along three different lattice directions to determine this anisotropic effect. In this work, the density functional theory calculations are performed based on Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP) code using normconserving pseudo potentials and a kinetic energy cutoff of 700 eV. The generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof parameterization is used. Monkhorst-Pack k-point meshes with a density of 0.05 angstrom(-1) are used for Brillouin-zone integration. The empirical dispersion correction by Grimme is taken to account for week intermolecular interactions. The hydrostatic compressions are applied from 0 GPa to 20 GPa. Cell volume, lattice shape and coordinates of the atoms could be fully relaxed. while uniaxial compression is applied up to 70% of the equilibrium cell volume in steps of 2% along their lattice directions respectively. At each compression step, only atomic coordinates are allowed to relax, with the lattice fixed. The equilibrium lattice structures under hydrostatic compressions are obtained by full relaxation at 0 K temperature. In ambient condition, the calculated volume and parameter of the unit cell are underestimated compared with the experimental data, and corresponding errors are -2.98%, 0.01%, -4.39%, 5.71% respectively. In contrast, the calculated lattice energy is overestimated compared with the range of experimental results with 5.71% of the error. In high pressure condition, the volume and cell parameter of the unit cell as a function of compression ratio are plotted and compared with the experimental data. The theoretical and experimental values are close with the increase of the pressure, for instant, the error decreases from 4.39% at 0 GPa to 1.93% at 4 GPa. On the other hand, the uniaxial compression is applied along the directions of three lattice vectors. The changes of stress tensor, band gap, energy per atom as a function of compression ratio are also plotted and discussed, which can characterize the anisotropic effect of solid nitrobenzene. The most noticeable effect of anisotropy in solid nitrobenzene is the metallization at V/V-0 = 0.76 compressed along the X axis, while the solid nitrobenzene under hydrostatic pressure or other uniaxial compressions up to V/V-0 = 0.76 remains semiconductor with band gap larger than 1.591 eV. By analyzing the local density of states and charge density distribution of nitrobenzene crystal, we confirm that the metallization is caused by the overlap of the Pi electron from benzene ring. Through calculating different physical parameters, we find that X axis is the most sensitive direction of nitrobenzene crystal. The studies of anisotropic effects are expected to shed light on the physical and chemical properties of solid nitrobenzene on an atomistic scale and provide several insights for experiments.","Authors":"Fan, JY (Fan Jun-Yu) ; Zheng, ZY (Zheng Zhao-Yang) ; Su, Y (Su Yan) ; Zhao, JJ (Zhao Ji-Jun)","Title":"First-principle simulation of solid nitrobenzene under uniaxial compression"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:Chinese Accession Number: WOS:000394412200027 ISSN: 0001-5733","Keywords":"Magnetotelluric; Impedance tensor imaging; Electrical structure; Linear structure; Tan-Lu fault KeyWords Plus:GALVANIC DISTORTION; DECOMPOSITION","Categories":"Geochemistry & Geophysics Web of Science Categories:Geochemistry & Geophysics","Journal Information":"CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION Volume: 60 Issue: 2 Pages: 766-777 DOI: 10.6038/cjg20170227 Published: FEB 2017","Abstract":"The linear structure of the earth is often associated with the boundary of the block or physical property and the geometric extension of faults, which is an important target structure of geo-science research. In the magnetotelluric method, the usual method is to interpret the linear structure by the difference of the electrical structure obtained by the inversion, which is an indirect analysis method. For the region rich of the linear tectonic structure, the strike or the dip is more obvious, the two-dimensionality is more stronger than other places. So in the impedance tensor imaging analysis, the corresponding two-dimensional effective factor will be larger, and the statistical distribution of the geo-electrical strike will be more obvious. Based on this, the magnetotelluric impedance tensor imaging (including the optimal principal azimuth statistical imaging and the structural dimension imaging) is used to detect and identify the linear structure of the earth. In this paper, the validity of the technique in the linear structure detection is verified by the research results of the three-dimensional theoretical model, and then applied to the field data analysis of the southern section of the Tan-Lu fault zone. Through these examples, we show the data processing and analysis of this technique using in detecting and identifying the linear structure.

We show that the term eta parallel to del u,(t)parallel to(2) alone is only able to disclose relatively simplified dispersive behaviour. On the other hand, the term. eta parallel to P,(t)parallel to(2) alone describes the full complex behaviour of band-gap metamaterials. A suitable mixing of the two micro-inertia terms allows us to describe a new feature of the relaxed-micromorphic model, i.e. the description of a second band-gap occurring for higher frequencies. We also show that a split of the gradient micro-inertia eta parallel to del u, (t) parallel to(2), in the sense of Cartan-Lie decomposition of matrices, allows us to flatten separately the longitudinal and transverse optic branches, thus giving us the possibility of a second band-gap. Finally, we investigate the effect of the gradient inertia eta parallel to del u,(t) parallel to(2) on more classical enriched models such as the Mindlin-Eringen and the internal variable ones. We find that the addition of such a gradient micro- inertia allows for the onset of one band-gap in the Mindlin- Eringen model and three band-gaps in the internal variable model. In this last case, however, non-local effects cannot be accounted for, which is a too drastic simplification for most metamaterials.

We also propose a new energy formulation of geometrically nonlinear Cosserat models which completely separate the effects of nonsymmetric straining and curvature. For very weak constitutive assumptions ( no direct boundary condition on rotations, zero Cosserat couple modulus, quadratic curvature energy), we show existence of minimizers in Sobolev spaces.","Authors":"Lankeit, J (Lankeit, Johannes) ; Neff, P (Neff, Patrizio) ; Osterbrink, F (Osterbrink, Frank)","Title":"Integrability conditions between the first and second Cosserat deformation tensor in geometrically nonlinear micropolar models and existence of minimizers"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397130100009 PubMed ID: 27555109 ISSN: 1064-7481 eISSN: 1545-7214","Keywords":"dementia; Alzheimer's disease; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); independent component analysis (ICA); tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) KeyWords Plus:DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; WHITE-MATTER CHANGES; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SUBJECT DIFFUSION DATA; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SPATIAL STATISTICS; VOXELWISE ANALYSIS; MRI; DEMENTIA; ABNORMALITIES","Categories":"Geriatrics & Gerontology; Psychiatry Web of Science Categories:Geriatrics & Gerontology; Gerontology; Psychiatry","Journal Information":"AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY Volume: 25 Issue: 2 Pages: 158-169 DOI: 10.1016/j.jagp.2016.05.001 Published: FEB 2017","Abstract":"Examination of brain structural and functional abnormalities in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) has the potential to enhance our understanding of the initial pathophysiological changes in dementia. We examined gray matter volumes and white matter microstructural integrity, as well as resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in patients with aMCI (N = 48) in comparison to elderly cognitively healthy comparison subjects (N = 48). Brain volumetric comparisons were carried out using voxelbased morphometric analysis of T1-weighted images using the FMRIB Software Library. White matter microstructural integrity was examined using whole-brain tract-based spatial statistics analysis of fractional anisotropy maps generated from diffusion tensor imaging data. Finally, rsFC differences between the samples were examined by Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimised Decomposition into Independent Components of the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging time series, followed by between-group comparisons of selected networks using dual regression analysis. Patients with aMCI showed significant gray matter volumetric reductions in bilateral parahippocampal gyri as well as multiple other brain regions including frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. Additionally, reduced rsFC in the anterior subdivision of the default mode network (DMN) and increased rsFC in the executive network were noted in the absence of demonstrable impairment of white matter microstructural integrity. We conclude that the demonstrable neuroimaging findings in aMCI include significant gray matter volumetric reductions in the fronto-temporo-parietal structures as well as resting state functional connectivity disturbances in DMN and executive network. These findings differentiate aMCI from healthy aging and could constitute the earliest demonstrable neuroimaging findings of incipient dementia.","Authors":"Bharath, S (Bharath, Srikala) ; Joshi, H (Joshi, Himanshu) ; John, JP (John, John P.) ; Balachandar, R (Balachandar, Rakesh) ; Sadanand, S (Sadanand, Shilpa) ; Saini, J (Saini, Jitendra) ; Kumar, KJ (Kumar, Keshav J.) ; Varghese, M (Varghese, Mathew)","Title":"A Multimodal Structural and Functional Neuroimaging Study of Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396804900001 ISSN: 0090-5364","Keywords":"Bayesian; categorical data; contingency table; latent class analysis; graphical model; high-dimensional; low rank; Parafac; Tucker; sparsity KeyWords Plus:GRAPHICAL MODELS; CONTINGENCY-TABLES; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; CATEGORICAL-DATA; FACTORIZATIONS; APPROXIMATIONS; EQUATIONS; SELECTION; GEOMETRY","Categories":"Mathematics Web of Science Categories:Statistics & Probability","Journal Information":"ANNALS OF STATISTICS Volume: 45 Issue: 1 Pages: 1-38 DOI: 10.1214/15-AOS1414 Published: FEB 2017","Abstract":"Contingency table analysis routinely relies on log-linear models, with latent structure analysis providing a common alternative.

We derive several results relating the support of a log-linear model to nonnegative ranks of the associated probability tensor.

By considering the observed HSI cube as a whole three-order tensor, the proposed CPTBC method utilizes the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC tensor decomposition to decompose the original HSI data into the sum of R rank-1 tensors, which can simultaneously exploit both the spatial and spectral information of HSIs. Specifically, compared with the original HSI data, the R rank-1 tensors have fewer non-zero entries. In addition, non-zero entries of the R rank-1 tensors are sparse and follow a regular distribution. Therefore, the HSI can be efficiently compressed into R rank-1 tensors with the proposed CPTBC method. Our experimental results on real three HSIs demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CPTBC method over several well-known compression approaches and the average PSNR improvements of the proposed method over the six compared methods (i. e., MPEG4, band-wise JPEG2000, TD, 3D-SPECK, 3D-TCE, 3D-TARP) are more than 13, 10, 6, 4, 3, and 3 dB, respectively.

However, there has been limited comparative analysis of the two approaches. This is due in part to difficulties arising from the fact that Galerkin techniques perform optimal projection associated with residual minimization at the time-continuous level, while LSPG techniques do so at the time discrete level. This work provides a detailed theoretical and computational comparison of the two techniques for two common classes of time integrators: linear multistep schemes and Runge-Kutta schemes. We present a number of new findings, including conditions under which the LSPG ROM has a time-continuous representation, conditions under which the two techniques are equivalent, and time-discrete error bounds for the two approaches. Perhaps most surprisingly, we demonstrate both theoretically and computationally that decreasing the time step does not necessarily decrease the error for the LSPG ROM; instead, the time step should be 'matched' to the spectral content of the reduced basis. In numerical experiments carried out on a turbulent compressible-flow problem with over one million unknowns, we show that increasing the time step to an intermediate value decreases both the error and the simulation time of the LSPG reduced-order model by an order of magnitude.

We further extend the proposed tensor algorithm to a semi-supervised framework, in order to utilize both labeled and unlabeled images. The objective function can be solved by using the alternative optimization method, where at each iteration, we solve the typical ridge regression problem to obtain the closed form solution of the parameter along the corresponding order.

In this work the enstrophy production mechanism is investigated to identify its variation in the wall-normal direction for the case of a turbulent boundary layer. Production is decomposed into its core quantities including the ratio of the principal strains and the alignment of vorticity with the eigenvectors of the strain rate tensor. The strong variations of these quantities with the wall distance are presented and explained. A self-similar shape of the probability distribution of the enstrophy production is found for regions above the buffer layer. Based on these findings we propose a modification to an existing vortex stretch model that accounts for the wall-normal variation in enstrophy production in a boundary layer. A characteristic decomposition is applied on the turbulence field that allows for the study of the individual production mechanisms of the separate structure types. This analysis reveals a potential backscatter mechanism that transfers kinetic energy from smaller scales towards larger ones, for a structure type described as unstable vortices.","Authors":"Bechlars, P (Bechlars, P.) ; Sandberg, RD (Sandberg, R.

The calculations are carried out by using generalized Poisson equations and in-plane Fourier transforms, which are convenient for treating boundary conditions. As a general result we compute the displacement in the isotropic elastic half-space with free surface caused by point forces with arbitrary structure and orientation, localized either beneath the surface (generalized Mindlin problem) or on the surface (generalized Boussinesq-Cerruti problems). The inverse Fourier transforms are carried out by means of Sommerfeld-type integrals. For forces buried in the half-space explicit results are given for the surface displacement, which may exhibit finite values at the origin, or at distances on the surface of the order of the depth of the source. The problem presented here may be viewed as an addition to the well-known static problems of elastic equilibrium of a half-space under the action of concentrated loads.

In many applications, some of the factor matrices are known to have orthogonality structure, and this information can be exploited to improve the accuracy of latent factors recovery. However, existing methods for CPD with orthogonal factors all require the knowledge of tensor rank, which is difficult to acquire, and have no mechanism to handle outliers in measurements. To overcome these disadvantages, in this paper, a novel tensor CPD algorithm based on the probabilistic inference framework is devised. In particular, the problem of tensor CPD with orthogonal factors is interpreted using a probabilistic model, based on which an inference algorithm is proposed that alternatively estimates the factor matrices, recovers the tensor rank, and mitigates the outliers. Simulation results using synthetic data and real-world applications are presented to illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy and robustness.","Authors":"Cheng, L (Cheng, Lei) ; Wu, YC (Wu, Yik-Chung) ; Poor, HV (Poor, H.

Considering this issue, the question of uniqueness conditions for a trilinear decomposition is among important points in dealing With three-way data arrays. Unfortunately, the identifiability of triadic decomposition is not fully understood yet, despite its theoretical and practical significance. Although some guidelines have been tentatively offered based on an investigation of arrays with rank-deficient loadings mathematically and empirically, the most general proof to date is due to Kruskal. It was previously shown that Kruskal's inequality is not just sufficient but necessary for unique decomposition of 2- and 3-component data arrays. This theorem is correct for general data with no constraints, however, according to provided results in this contribution, unique solution can be preserved under minimal assumptions (using non-negativity constraint) for 2- and 3-component arrays when Kruskal's inequality violated with selective part in profiles. To cover different conditions, a thorough analysis will be provided to go from cases with a simple rank deficiency in a loading matrix to cases with a more complex rank deficiency in all modes. Feasible regions were calculated for profiles hi each considered simulated example using PARAFAC based grid search method.

An existing, algebraic algorithm (based on simultaneous diagonalization of a set of matrices) computes the CPD under the more restrictive constraint R(R - 1) <= I(I - 1) J (J - 1)/2 (implying that R < (J - 1/2)(I - 1/2)/root 2 + 1. We give an example of a low-dimensional but high-rank CPD that cannot be found by optimization-based algorithms in a reasonable amount of time while our approach takes less than a second. We demonstrate that, at least for R <= 24, our algorithm can recover the rank-1 tensors in the CPD up to R <= (I - 1)(J - 1). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Shorter and more shallow cavities exhibit less amplified responses, while energy from the base flow can be extracted predominantly from forcing that impacts the cavity head on. A structural sensitivity analysis, combined with a componentwise decomposition of the sensitivity tensor, reveals the regions of the flow that act most effectively as amplifiers.

Experimental data from stereo particle image velocimetry measurements in a wind turbine array and direct numerical simulation data from a fully developed channel flow are used to illustrate dependence of the anisotropy tensor invariants as a function of POD modes used in low-order descriptions. In all cases, ensembles of snapshots illuminate a variety of anisotropic states of turbulence. In the near wake of a model wind turbine, the turbulence field reflects the periodic interaction between the incoming flow and rotor blade. The far wake of the wind turbine is more homogenous, confirmed by the increased magnitude of the anisotropy factor. By contrast, the channel flow exhibits many anisotropic states of turbulence. In the inner layer of the wall-bounded region, one observes one-component turbulence at the wall; immediately above, the turbulence is dominated by two components, with the outer layer showing fully three-dimensional turbulence, conforming to theory for wall-bounded turbulence. The complexity of flow descriptions resulting from truncated POD bases can be greatly mitigated by severe basis truncations. However, the current work demonstrates that such simplification necessarily exaggerates the anisotropy of the modeled flow and, in extreme cases, can lead to the loss of three-dimensionality. Application of simple corrections to the low-order descriptions of the Reynolds stress tensor significantly reduces the residual root-mean-square error. Similar error reduction is seen in the anisotropy tensor invariants. Corrections of this form reintroduce three-dimensionality to severe truncations of POD bases. A threshold for truncating the POD basis based on the equivalent anisotropy factor for each measurement set required many more modes than a threshold based on energy. The mode requirement to reach the anisotropy threshold after correction is reduced by a full order of magnitude for all example data sets, ensuring that economical low-dimensional models account for the isotropic quality of the turbulence field.","Authors":"Hamilton, N (Hamilton, Nicholas) ; Tutkun, M (Tutkun, Murat) ; Cal, RB (Cal, Raul Bayoan)","Title":"Anisotropic character of low-order turbulent flow descriptions through the proper orthogonal decomposition"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398542700003 ISSN: 0895-4798 eISSN: 1095-7162","Keywords":"joint block diagonalization; tensor decomposition; independent component analysis KeyWords Plus:CANONICAL POLYADIC DECOMPOSITION; HIGHER-ORDER TENSOR; EXPLOITING GROUP SYMMETRY; MATRIX ASTERISK-ALGEBRAS; 3RD-ORDER TENSORS; UNIQUENESS; SEPARATION; IDENTIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; SQUARES","Categories":"Mathematics Web of Science Categories:Mathematics, Applied","Journal Information":"SIAM JOURNAL ON MATRIX ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS Volume: 38 Issue: 1 Pages: 50-71 DOI: 10.1137/16M1080756 Published: 2017","Abstract":"The exact/approximate nonorthogonal general joint block diagonalization (NOGJBD) problem of a given real matrix set A = {A(i)}(i=1)(m) is to find a nonsingular matrix W epsilon R-nxn (diagonalizer) such that W(T)A(i)W for i = 1, 2,..., m are all exactly/approximately block diagonal matrices with the same diagonal block structure and with as many diagonal blocks as possible.

The pattern of interest, such as epileptic activity, is often hidden within this noisy mixture. Therefore, blind source separation (BSS) techniques, which can retrieve the activity pattern of each underlying source, are very useful. Tensor decomposition techniques are very well suited to solve the BSS problem, as they provide a unique solution under mild constraints. Uniqueness is crucial for an unambiguous interpretation of the components, matching them to true neural processes and characterizing them using the component signatures. Moreover, tensors provide a natural representation of the inherently multidimensional EEG and fMRI, and preserve the structural information defined by the inter-dependencies among the various modes such as channels, time, patients, etc. Despite the well-developed theoretical framework, tensor-based analysis of real, large-scale clinical datasets is still scarce. Indeed, the application of tensor methods is not straightforward. Finding an appropriate tensor representation, suitable tensor model, and interpretation are application dependent choices, which require expertise both in neuroscience and in multilinear algebra. The aim of this paper is to provide a general guideline for these choices and illustrate them through successful applications in epilepsy. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Two possible approaches are considered: (1) the spectral decomposition of the stiffness tensor to define the microplane constitutive laws in terms of energetically orthogonal eigenstrains and eigenstresses and (2) the definition of orientation-dependent microplane elastic moduli. The first approach, as demonstrated previously, provides a rigorous way to tackle anisotropy within the microplane framework, which is reviewed and presented herein in a clearer manner; whereas the second approach represents an approximation which, however, makes the formulation of nonlinear constitutive equations much simpler. The efficacy of the second approach in modeling the macroscopic elastic behavior is compared to the thermodynamic restrictions of the anisotropic parameters showing that a significant range of elastic properties can be modeled with excellent accuracy. Further, it is shown that it provides a very good approximation of the microplane stresses provided by the first approach, with the advantage of a simpler formulation. It is concluded that the spectral stiffness decomposition represents the best approach in such cases as for modeling composites, in which accurately capturing the elastic behavior is important. The introduction of orientation-dependent microplane elastic moduli provides a simpler framework for the modeling of transversely isotropic materials with remarked inelastic behavior, as in the case, for example, of shale rock.","Authors":"Jin, CR (Jin, Congrui) ; Salviato, M (Salviato, Marco) ; Li, WX (Li, Weixin) ; Cusatis, G (Cusatis, Gianluca)","Title":"Elastic Microplane Formulation for Transversely Isotropic Materials"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395391200022 ISSN: 1070-6631 eISSN: 1089-7666","Categories":"Mechanics; Physics Web of Science Categories:Mechanics; Physics, Fluids & Plasmas","Journal Information":"PHYSICS OF FLUIDS Volume: 29 Issue: 1 Article Number: 015101 DOI: 10.1063/1.4973243 Published: JAN 2017","Abstract":"A number of systematic procedures for the identification of vortices/coherent structures have been developed as a way to address their possible kinematical and dynamical roles in structural formulations of turbulence. It has been broadly acknowledged, however, that vortex detection algorithms, usually based on linear-algebraic properties of the velocity gradient tensor, can be plagued with severe shortcomings and may become, in practical terms, dependent on the choice of subjective threshold parameters in their implementations. In two-dimensions, a large class of standard vortex identification prescriptions turn out to be equivalent to the \"swirling strength criterion\" (lambda(ci)-criterion), which is critically revisited in this work. We classify the instances where the accuracy of the lambda(ci)-criterion is affected by nonlinear superposition effects and propose an alternative vortex detection scheme based on the local curvature properties of the vorticity graph (x, y, omega)-the \"vorticity curvature criterion\" (lambda(omega)-criterion)-which improves over the results obtained with the lambda(ci)-criterion in controlled Monte Carlo tests. A particularly problematic issue, given its importance in wall-bounded flows, is the eventual inadequacy of the lambda(ci)-criterion for many-vortex configurations in the presence of strong background shear. We show that the lambda(omega)-criterion is able to cope with these cases as well, if a subtraction of the mean velocity field background is performed, in the spirit of the Reynolds decomposition procedure. A realistic comparative study for vortex identification is then carried out for a direct numerical simulation of a turbulent channel flow, including a three-dimensional extension of the lambda(omega)-criterion. In contrast to the lambda(ci)-criterion, the lambda(omega)-criterion indicates in a consistent way the existence of small scale isotropic turbulent fluctuations in the logarithmic layer, in consonance with long-standing assumptions commonly taken in turbulent boundary layer phenomenology.

We show that this iteration converges for sufficiently large separation distances and we solve the arising sequence of six-dimensional PDEs with a finite element method in combination with low-rank tensor techniques to make the computations tractable. In particular we show how the discretized problems can be represented and solved in the tensor-train format. Since the storage and computational complexity of this format scale linearly in the dimension, a very large number of grid points can be employed, which leads to accurate approximations of the ground-state energy and ground-state wavefunction. Various numerical experiments show the performance and accuracy of this method.","Authors":"Veit, A (Veit, Alexander) ; Scott, LR (Scott, L.

In this paper, we propose two generalized iterative estimation algorithms to the case in which a multidimensional (R-D) sensor array is used at the receiver. The first tensor-based algorithm is an R-D blind spatial signature estimator that operates in scenarios where the source's covariance matrix is nondiagonal and unknown. The second tensor-based algorithm is formulated for the case in which the sources are uncorrelated and exploits the dual-symmetry of the covariance tensor. Additionally, a new tensor-based formulation is proposed for an L-shaped array configuration. Simulation results show that our proposed schemes outperform the state-of-the-art matrix-based and tensor-based techniques.","Authors":"Gomes, PRB (Gomes, Paulo R.
