This study was to examine whether MCD-induced weight reduction caused changes in the extended plasma metabolites. Overweight and obese subjects aged 40-59 years consumed a MCD (approximately 100 kcal/day deficit, n=47) or a weight-maintenance diet (control, n=47) in a randomized, controlled design with a three-year clinical intervention period and plasma samples were analyzed by using UPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry. The three-year MCD intervention resulted in weight loss (-8.87%) and significant decreases in HOMA-IR and TG. The three-year follow-up of the MCD group showed reductions in the following 13 metabolites: L-leucine; L-phenylalanine; 9 lysoPCs; PC (18:0/20:4); and SM (d18:0/16:1). The three-year MCD group follow-up identified increases in palmitic amide, oleamide, and PC (18:2/18:2). Considering the age-related alterations in the identified metabolites, the MCD group showed a greater decrease in L-leucine, L-phenylalanine, and SM (d18:0/16:1) compared with those of the control group. Overall, the change (Delta) in BMI positively correlated with the Delta TG, Delta HOMA-IR, Delta L-leucine, and Delta SM (d18:0/16:1). The Delta HOMA-IR positively correlated with Delta TG, Delta L-leucine, Delta L-phenylalanine, and Delta SM (d18:0/16:1). The weight loss resulting from three-year mild-caloric restriction lessens the age-related increase in SM and reduces L-leucine and L-phenylalanine in overweight and obese subjects. These changes were coupled with improved insulin resistance (ClinicalTrials. gov:NCT02081898).","Authors":"Kim, M (Kim, Minjoo) ; Lee, SH (Lee, Sang-Hyun) ; Lee, JH (Lee, Jong Ho)","Title":"Global Metabolic Profiling of Plasma Shows that Three-Year Mild-Caloric Restriction Lessens an Age-Related Increase in Sphingomyelin and Reduces L-leucine and L-phenylalanine in Overweight and Obese Subjects"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397703900011 PubMed ID: 28343298 ISSN: 1862-3522 eISSN: 1862-3514","Keywords":"Diuretic; Hemodialysis; Hydrochlorothiazide; Calcium; Parathyroid hormone KeyWords Plus:PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM; DIURETICS","Categories":"Endocrinology & Metabolism; Orthopedics Web of Science Categories:Endocrinology & Metabolism; Orthopedics","Journal Information":"ARCHIVES OF OSTEOPOROSIS Volume: 12 Issue: 1 Article Number: 31 DOI: 10.1007/s11657-017-0326-3 Published: DEC 2017","Abstract":"A Summary We evaluated the effect of hydrochlorothiazide in a sample of anuric patients on hemodialysis and found an increase in serum calcium, which occurred only in those with parathyroid hormone > 300 pg/ml. This finding highlights the extra-renal effect of this diuretic and a possible role of parathyroid hormone in the mechanism. Purpose Thiazide diuretics are commonly used in patients with chronic kidney disease to treat hypertension. Their effects on calcium and bone metabolism are not well established, once calciuria may not fully explain levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) in this population. A previous study has suggested that thiazides require the presence of PTH as a permissive condition for its renal action. In anuric patients, however, the role of PTH, if any, in the thiazide effect is unknown. Methods To assess thiazide extra renal effect on serum calcium and whether such an effect is reliant on PTH, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 100 mg was given orally once a day to a sample of 19 anuric patients on hemodialysis for 2 weeks. Laboratories' analyses were obtained in three phases: baseline, after diuretic use, and after a 2-week washout phase. Results We demonstrated that serum calcium (Ca) increased in ten patients (52.6%) after HCTZ use, returning to previous levels after the washout period. Out of the 19 patients, ten presented PTH >= 300 pg/ml, and Ca has increased in eight of them, whereas in the other nine patients with PTH < 300 pg/ml, serumCa has increased only in two individuals (RR risk of increase Ca 3.9; p = 0.012). Conclusions HCTZ was capable of increasing serum Ca in a sample of anuric patients on hemodialysis and seems this effect is highly dependent on PTH levels. Caution is required while interpreting this result, as the small sample size might implicate in a finding caused by chance.","Authors":"Vasco, RFV (Vasco, Raquel F.

Previous studies revealed destructive effects of amphetamines on metabolism, perfusion and structure of brain. The aim of current study was evaluating regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) disturbances in methamphetamine (MA) abusers using brain perfusion SPECT. Methods: This case control study was carried out on 15 MA abusers and 10 healthy volunteers. All 15 MA abusers had a history of MA abuse for at least one year, positive qualitative urinary test for amphetamine. All cases were substance dependent based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. Patients with opioid and other substance abuse except nicotine and caffeine, positive history of head trauma, loss of consciousness more than 30 minutes and also pregnant women were excluded. All subjects underwent brain perfusion Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Results: Of 15 MA users 11 and 4 cases were males and females respectively. Mean age was 42/46 +/- 12.08 (range: 22-65) years old. Mean age of control group was 39.56 +/- 10.10 (range: 25-63) years old. All MA abusers were currently on using MA. Mean dose of MA use was 0.7 gram per day and mean duration of consumption was 4.86 (1-12) years. Significant differences were observed in scan results (normal or abnormal scan) between two groups (p<0.05). Of all 15 MA abusers, global decreased tracer uptake was observed in 4 patients (26.7%), global decrease uptake except for the cerebellum was detected in 6 cases (40%), and decreased tracer uptake in fronto-temporal lobes was observed in 2 cases (13.3%), decreased uptake was detected only in the temporal lobe in 2 patients (13.3%) and in temporo-occipital lobes in one case (6.7%). In patients group, decrease in perfusion was more prominent in right frontal, superior frontal and parietal lobes compared with left hemisphere. SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) analysis showed significant difference in rCBF between MA abusers and normal volunteers throughout the cerebral cortex with nonhomogeneous decreased tracer uptake. Conclusion: In this study, we showed that amphetamine abuse can induce diffuse and nonhomogeneous disorders of brain perfusion which was more prominent in the right hemisphere.","Authors":"Kakhki, VRD (Kakhki, Vahid Reza Dabbagh) ; Sani, FM (Sani, Fereshteh Madani) ; Dadpour, B (Dadpour, Bita)","Title":"Abnormal cerebral blood flow in methamphetamine abusers assessed by brain perfusion single emission computed tomography"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000393176400008 ISSN: 1681-2824 eISSN: 2008-2509","Keywords":"F-18-FDG; Myocardial uptake; SUVmax; PET/CT; Oncology; Imaging KeyWords Plus:FDG UPTAKE; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; HIGH-FAT; SUBSTRATE METABOLISM; DIABETES-MELLITUS; LOW-CARBOHYDRATE; HEART; OBESITY; RATS; MICE","Categories":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging Web of Science Categories:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","Journal Information":"IRANIAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE Volume: 25 Issue: 1 Pages: 52-61 Supplement: SI Published: WIN 2017","Abstract":"Introduction: Myocardial F-18-FDG uptake is highly variable in oncologic whole body F-18-FDG PET/CT studies, ranging from quite intense to minimal distribution. Intense or heterogeneous myocardial F-18-FDG uptake is undesirable as it may interfere with the visual or quantitative evaluation of tumoral invasion and metastases in pericardium, myocardium or adjacent mediastinal structures. The diet, as well as many other factors, is assumed to influence the myocardial F-18-FDG uptake. Using a multivariate model, we tried to identify and predict the main factors influencing cardiac F-18-FDG uptake in patients referred for oncologic PET/CT evaluation. Methods: A total of 214 patients referred for oncologic F-18-FDG PET/CT scan were enrolled in our study. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups according to the diet they were instructed to follow during 24-hour period before imaging. One hundred and seven cases with a routine diet (RD) and the same number of patients with a low carbohydrate, high fat (LCHF) diet were included. All patients were fast 6 hours before imaging. Weight, height, blood glucose, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured before radiotracer injection. Visual and quantitative analysis were done after imaging and the pattern of F-18-FDG uptake, as well as standardized quantitative value of cardiac uptake was determined for each case. Results: The frequency of undesirable cardiac F-18-FDG uptake in the LCHF group was significantly less than RD group (17% vs. 72%, p<0.001). The univariate analyses showed male gender, BMI>=30 as well as consumption of cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, benzodiazepines and beta blockers were significantly associated with higher intensity of myocardial F-18-FDG uptake, while this undesirable finding was less evident in cases with diabetes mellitus. A multivariate logistic regression model including all of the mentioned variables revealed the diet was the only significant independent factor that predicted undesirable myocardial F-18-FDG uptake (p<0.001). Conclusion: LCHF diet 24 hours before PET/CT imaging is the only controllable independent factor influencing the intensity and pattern of myocardial F-18-FDG uptake and is recommended as an optimal preparation to suppress cardiac F-18-FDG uptake.","Authors":"Fallahi, B (Fallahi, Babak) ; Moasses-Ghafari, B (Moasses-Ghafari, Bahar) ; Fard-Esfahani, A (Fard-Esfahani, Armaghan) ; Geramifar, P (Geramifar, Parham) ; Beiki, D (Beiki, Davood) ; Emami-Ardekani, A (Emami-Ardekani, Alireza) ; Eftekhari, M (Eftekhari, Mohammad)","Title":"Factors influencing the pattern and intensity of myocardial F-18-FDG uptake in oncologic PET-CT imaging"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000391000000003 ISSN: 1681-2824 eISSN: 2008-2509","Keywords":"PET; SPECT; HMPAO; Alzheimer's disease KeyWords Plus:MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; HMPAO-SPET; DEMENTIA; METABOLISM","Categories":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging Web of Science Categories:Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging","Journal Information":"IRANIAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE Volume: 25 Issue: 1 Pages: 17-22 Published: WIN 2017","Abstract":"Introduction: Brain imaging with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) positron emission tomography or Tc-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (Tc-99m-HMPAO) SPECT is widely used for the evaluation of Alzheimer's dementia (AD); we aim to assess superiority of one method over the other.

This study was conducted to determine whether multiple pregnancy and prolonged duration of breast-feeding are independent predictors of low bone mass in post-menopausal Kurdish women. Methods: In a retrospective study, we evaluated 991 post-menopausal women with mean age of 58.9 years screened for osteoporosis by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). According to the parity (1-2, 3-4, 5-7, >7 children) and total duration of breast-feeding (1-24, 25-60, 61-96, >96 months) they were classified. Bone mineral density (BMD) results for femoral neck and lumbar spine were classified into three groups (normal, osteopenia, and osteoporosis) according to the WHO criteria. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the independent associations of low femur or spine BMD with parity and total duration of breast-feeding. Results: We found that women with 5 or more children and having more than 60 months history of total breast-feeding, were older (p<0.001) with higher prevalence of osteoporosis (p<0.001). However, after adjusting for age only parity was independent predictor for osteopenia (OR: 1.336; 95% CI 1.29-1.735) while total duration of breast-feeding was not an independent predictor of low bone mass.

However, prolonged duration of breast-feeding has no long-term adverse effect on maternal BMD in post-menopausal age.","Authors":"Derakhshan, S (Derakhshan, Siamak) ; Mahmoudi, M (Mahmoudi, Mozaffar) ; Shahsawari, S (Shahsawari, Sirous)","Title":"Effects of multiparity and duration of breast-feeding on maternal bone mineral density in post-menopausal Kurdish women: A retrospective study"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000386792500003 PubMed ID: 28042534 ISSN: 2228-5806 eISSN: 2228-5814","Keywords":"Citric Acid; Cytotoxicity; Esophageal Carcinoma Cell EC109; Cell Proliferation; Apoptosis KeyWords Plus:CANCER-CELLS; IMPROVE CANCER; CITRATE; DEATH; METABOLISM","Categories":"Cell Biology Web of Science Categories:Cell Biology","Journal Information":"CELL JOURNAL Volume: 18 Issue: 4 Pages: 493-502 Published: WIN 2017","Abstract":"Objective: Today, esophageal cancer (EC) has become one of the most common cancer types in China. Therefore, new drug and therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to improve postoperative survival rate of patients with EC. As a food additive, several lines of evidence have shown that citric acid can be served as glycolysis suppressor to inhibit growth of some tumor cells. However, little is known about the effect of this organic acid on the growth of human esophageal carcinoma cell line, EC109. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, cell proliferation rate was determined using MTT assay. Apoptotic morphological changes were evaluated by fluorescent microscopy using Hoechst 33258 staining. Cell apoptosis rate and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were detected using flow-cytometry. Effect of citric acid on cellular membrane permeability was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, using LDH assay kit. Results: Compared to the control group, there was a marked decrease in cells proliferation when the cells were treated with higher citric acid concentrations (800, 1600 mu g/ml). Typical apoptotic morphology of EC109 cells was observed upon treatment with citric acid, such as chromatin condensation and appearance of apoptotic body. Cell apoptotic indexes were significantly increased (P<0.01) after treatment with citric acid at the concentration of 400-1600 mu g/ml. Extracellular LDH activity and loss of MMP in all of the treated groups were significantly higher than control (P<0.05), in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: These results suggest that citric acid prevents EC109 cell growth by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis, which perhaps offers some theoretical guidance for its application in EC treatment.","Authors":"Chen, XG (Chen, Xiaoguang) ; Lv, QX (Lv, Qiongxia) ; Liu, YM (Liu, Yumei) ; Deng, W (Deng, Wen) Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number ÐÐ°Ð³Ð¸ÑÑÑ, ÐÐ»ÐµÐºÑÐ°Ð½Ð´ÑÂ  R-5271-2016 http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1377-1448","Title":"Effect of Food Additive Citric Acid on The Growth of Human Esophageal Carcinoma Cell Line EC109"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397362000032 ISSN: 0956-7135 eISSN: 1873-7129","Keywords":"Foodborne pathogen; Listeria monocytogenes; Nisin; Persister KeyWords Plus:BACTERIAL PERSISTENCE; ANTIBIOTIC TOLERANCE; BIOFILM FORMATION; RESISTANCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ENUMERATION; SURVIVAL; FOOD","Categories":"Food Science & Technology Web of Science Categories:Food Science & Technology","Journal Information":"FOOD CONTROL Volume: 77 Pages: 243-250 DOI: 10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.02.011 Published: JUL 2017","Abstract":"The persistence of Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) can be defined by its prolonged existence in food environments that poses a risk to food safety. The persistence of cells exposed to antibiotics and chemical sanitisers is well recorded however the persistence following treatment with natural antimicrobials like bacteriocins has not been determined. This study used two L. monocytogenes isolates, one from food and one from an animal origin, to obtain a persistent subpopulation following exposure to the natural antimicrobial nisin. Overnight cultures of L monocytogenes were treated with 75 mu g/ml of nisin over 24 h, and a biphasic killing pattern was observed for both strains. Persister cells became a population of cells showing tolerance to the high concentrations of nisin in our tests and proved not to be resistant with nisin re-exposure tests. XTT assays showed that the reduced level of metabolism maybe an important requirement for the L monocytogenes persistence and the persister population which could survive at high concentration of nisin was probably related to less negative cell surface charges. The current data will be initial evidence to understand the mechanism of persistence through gene expression and in the future to give more reliable clues in developing strategies to control this food safety risk.

The amount of the different amendments was adjusted in order to meet the N requirement of tomato crop. The Biolog results were used to draw a binomial matrix of data by setting all the positive results to 1 and all the negative results to 0. The occurrence of the microbial oxidation of each Biolog Ecoplates(TM) C source was calculated as probability 'p' on the binomial set of data for each dilution. In terms of persistence of C sources utilization by soil microflora, along decimal soil dilutions, the treatments can be roughly divided in 3 different categories: the worst performing (control), the intermediate performing (biochar), and the best performing (biochar added to an organic fertilizer, the organic fertilizer alone and 3 composts). Biolog positive wells at the dilution 10(-4) were used to carry out a molecular characterization of bacterial communities by 16S fingerprinting, through the H' Shannon diversity index. Microbial communities utilizing cellulose and hemicelluloses as C source changed their species composition in response to the different amendments. In particular, amendments with bio-char, regardless of the application of organic fertilizers, brought to the highest diversity of cellulose degrading bacteria.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

DHAP is involved in lipid metabolism and phospholipid synthesis. In order to know the role of TPI in WSSV infection to prawn, we cloned the full length cDNA of triosephosphate isomerase gene (EcTPI) from Exopalaemon carinicauda, and its function during WSSV infection was analyzed. EcTPI transcripts were widely distributed in all tissues, but showed relatively higher expression levels in the gill and epidermis. Its expression was apparently up-regulated after 24 h post WSSV injection (hpi), when the virus load began to rise. Furthermore, we detected the expressions of the key genes encoding the enzymes which catalyze the key steps in the glycolysis during WSSV infection. The data showed that genes encoding the enzymes which catalyzed upper steps of glycolysis to produce GAP including hexokinase (HK), glucose 6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) and phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), were significantly up-regulated at 24 and 27 hpi. Genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing down steps of glycolysis after GAP, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), enolase (ENO) and pyruvate kinase (PM), were apparent down-regulated at 24 and 27 hpi. Meanwhile, the gene encoding the enzyme glycerol-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) catalyzing DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P) showed down regulation at 12-27 hpi, while the gene encoding dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase (DHA-PAT) catalyzing DHAP to further synthesis of phospholipids showed up-regulation at 12-24 hpi. These data suggested that WSSV infection could change the glycolysis pathway to make them produce more phospholipids which could be very helpful for virus replication. In order to further confirm the above speculation, dsRNA interference (RNAi) approach was used to knock down EcTPI gene and analyze its effect on WSSV load in prawn. The data showed that interference of EcTPI gene led to a significant decrease of WSSV loads in WSSV infected prawn. These data provided useful information to understand the infection mechanism of WSSV. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

For this reason, more research should be devoted to determining the content and spatio-temporal variability of sulfur in relation to an improved management of this element. The aims of this study were to assess the spatio-temporal variability of soil sulfur forms and arylsulfatase activity against selected physicochemical properties on a plot scale. A grid soil sampling (10 x 10 m) was used to measure the spatial variation of soil properties across a 0.4 ha field. Soil samples were collected from the upper 27 cm of Luvisols at 50 location in April and August 2007 and 2008. The total (S-TOT), organic (S-ORG) and available (SO42--S) sulfur concentrations and arylsulfatase (AS) activity were analyzed. Additionally, total organic carbon (C-ORG), total nitrogen (N-TOT) concentrations, soil pH(KCl) as well as texture and water content were determined. The dataset was analyzed using classical statistical and geostatistical methods. Based on the analysis of variance, it was found that soil properties, except for CoRG, NTOT and pHR0, showed significant differences between the four sampling dates (Tukey's test, p < 0.05). Additionally, it was found that the temporal stability of the data set showed no clear time -associated shift based on Spearman's rank correlations coefficients. Relatively high degree of variability of the soil properties over time was also indicated by the mean relative differences (MRD). Generally, higher level of temporal stability was noted for the S forms and CoRG and Nror concentrations as compared to the AS activity. Among the studied propertieS, only AS activity at all sampling times and all of the S forms measured in August (except S-TOT in 2008 and SO42-S in 2007) revealed a spatial autocorrelation (Moran's 1). All the studied properties revealed a high contribution of nugget effect in sill (over 50%) or pure nugget effect Some properties revealed a moderate spatial structure (a nugget/sill ratio between 59.2 and 70.3%), whereas the concentration of SoRG measured in August 2008,and AS activity analyzed in 2008 were in the weak variability class. Only AS activity in 2007 showed a pure nugget effect The range of spatial autocorrelation calculated for the analyzed properties was between 20.0 and 34.0 m. Results of this study are essential to understand and predict the contribution of internal factors in the total variability of soil properties that can interfere with the influence of soil management practices. The spatio-temporal variability showed that the studied area was temporally unstable and more frequent sampling must be included in the sampling strategy in order to better understand whether the S forms and AS activity always show permanent spatial patterns in soil or whether they are more randomized.

Extracellular purines are important signaling molecules in the vasculature, and both purine-hydrolysing as well as -phosphorylating enzymes are considered to selectively govern extracellular nucleotide/nucleoside metabolism. Recent studies have provided some evidence for the existence of these enzymes in a soluble form in human blood and their secretion into the extracellular space under physiological and pathological conditions. However, the comprehensive analysis of endothelium-derived enzymes involved in purine metabolic pathways has received no attention so far. In the presented study, in vitro cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) are shown to be an abundant source of exo-nucleotidases comprising 5-nucleotidase (exo-5-NT), and nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (exo-NTPDase) as well as phosphotransferases, represented by nucleoside diphosphate kinase (exo-NDPK) and adenylate kinase (exo-AK). An attempt is also made to demonstrate that, in contrast to the metabolic pattern determined on the endothelial cell surface, exo-phosphorylating activities markedly predominate over exo-hydrolytic ones. We present for the first time the expression profiles of genes encoding isoenzymes belonging to distinct nucleotide kinase and nucleotidase families. The genes encoding NDPK1, NDPK2, AK1, and AK2 phosphotransferases have been shown to be expressed at the highest level in HUVEC cells. The data indicate the coexistence of secreted and cell-associated factors of endothelial origin mediating ATP-consuming and ATP-generating pathways with the predominance of exo-phosphotransferases activity.

In mouse models, the Runx genes appear to act as conditional oncogenes, as ectopic expression is growth suppressive in normal cells but drives lymphoma development potently when combined with over-expressed Myc or loss of p53. Clues to underlying mechanisms emerged previously from murine fibroblasts where ectopic expression of any of the Runx genes promotes survival through direct and indirect regulation of key enzymes in sphingolipid metabolism associated with a shift in the \"sphingolipid rheostat\" from ceramide to sphingosine- 1-phosphate (S1P). Testing of this relationship in lymphoma cells was therefore a high priority. We find that ectopic expression of Runx1 in lymphoma cells consistently perturbs the sphingolipid rheostat, whereas an essential physiological role for Runx1 is revealed by reduced S1P levels in normal spleen after partial Cre-mediated excision. Furthermore, we show that ectopic Runx1 expression confers increased resistance of lymphoma cells to glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis, and elucidate the mechanism of cross-talk between glucocorticoid and sphingolipid metabolism through Sgpp1. Dexamethasone potently induces expression of Sgpp1 in T-lymphoma cells and drives cell death which is reduced by partial knockdown of Sgpp1 with shRNA or direct transcriptional repression of Sgpp1 by ectopic Runx1. Together these data show that Runx1 plays a role in regulating the sphingolipid rheostat in normal development and that perturbation of this cell fate regulator contributes to Runx-driven lymphomagenesis.

Recent studies have reported that appropriate intermittent hypobaric hypoxia played a protective role in brain injury caused by acute hypoxia. However, the mechanisms of this protective effect have not been fully understood. In this study, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat models were developed by hypobaric hypoxia treatment in an altitude chamber, and the iron level and iron related protein levels were determined in rat brain after 4 weeks of treatment. We found that the iron levels significantly decreased in the cortex and hippocampus of rat brain as compared to that of the control rats without hypobaric hypoxia treatment. The expression levels of iron storage protein L-ferritin and iron transport proteins, including transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1), divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), and ferroportin1 (FPN1), were also altered. Further studies found that the iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) played a dominant regulatory role in the changes of iron hemostasis, whereas iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) mainly acted as cis-aconitase. These results, for the first time, showed the alteration of iron metabolism during hypobaric hypoxia in rat models, which link the potential neuroprotective role of hypobaric hypoxia treatment to the decreased iron level in brain. This may provide insight into the treatment of iron-overloaded neurodegenerative diseases. J. Cell. Biochem.

Identifying factors that influence this shift in cellular metabolism in cancer cells is important. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been reported to be elevated in colorectal cancer patients. While much is known toward the effect of dietary nutrients on regulating inflammation and the inflammatory response, which includes cytokines such as IL-1 beta, far less is understood how cytokines impact nutrient fate to alter cancer cell metabolism. Butyrate, a nutrient derived from the fermentation of dietary fiber in the colon, is the preferential exogenous energetic substrate used by non-cancerous colonocytes, but is used less efficiently by colorectal cancer cells. To test whether IL-1 beta alters colonocyte energy metabolism, we measured butyrate oxidation in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells with and without IL-1 beta. We hypothesize that IL-1 beta will push cancerous colonocytes away from the utilization and oxidation of butyrate. In this study, we demonstrate that pretreatment of colorectal cancer cells with IL-1 beta diminished butyrate oxidation and NADH levels. This effect was blocked with the interleukin receptor antagonist A (IL-1RA). Moreover, IL-1 beta suppressed basal mitochondrial respiration and lowered the mitochondrial spare capacity. By using inhibitors to block downstream targets of the interleukin-1 receptor pathway, we show that p38 is required for the IL-1 beta-mediated decrease in butyrate oxidation. These data provide insight into the metabolic effects induced by IL-1 beta in colorectal cancer, and identify relevant targets that may be exploited to block the effects of this cytokine. J. Cell.

Emerging evidence indicates that microRNAs also participate in mechanical stress-mediated bone metabolism, and is associated with disuse induced osteoporosis or osteopenia. Mechanical stress is able to induce expression of microRNAs that modulate the expression of osteogenic and bone resorption factors, leading to the positive impact of mechanical stress on bone.

Mature adipocytes are derived and differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or preadipocytes. This differentiation process, also called adipogenesis, is regulated by several signaling pathways and transcription factors. Notch1 signaling is a highly conserved pathway that is indispensable for stem cell hemostasis and tissue development. In adipocyte progenitor cells, Notch1 signaling regulates the adipogenesis process including proliferation and differentiation of the adipocyte progenitor cells in vitro. Notably, the roles of Notch1 signaling in beige adipocytes formation, adipose development, and function, and the whole body energy metabolism have been recently reported. Here, we mainly review and discuss the roles of Notch1 signaling in adipogenesis in vitro as well as in beige adipocytes formation, adipocytes dedifferentiation, and function in vivo.

A previous study showed that normoxia (20% O-2) plus 24 h hypoglycemia (2.5mMglucose) increased glycolytic flux whereas oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) was unchanged versus normoglycemia in HeLa cells. However, the simultaneous effect of HH on energy metabolism has not been yet examined. Therefore, the effect of hypoxia (0.1-1% O2) plus hypoglycemia on the energy metabolism of HeLa cells was analyzed by evaluating protein content and activity, along with fluxes of both glycolysis and OxPhos. Under hypoxia, in which cell growth ceased and OxPhos enzyme activities, Delta psi m and flux were depressed, hypoglycemia did not stimulate glycolytic flux despite increasing H-RAS, p-AMPK, GLUT1, GLUT3, and HKI levels, and further decreasing mitochondrial enzyme content. The impaired mitochondrial function in HH cells correlated with mitophagy activation. The depressed OxPhos and unchanged glycolysis pattern was also observed in quiescent cells from mature multicellular tumor spheroids, suggesting that these inner cell layers are similarly subjected to HH. The principal ATP supplier was glycolysis for HH 2D monolayer and 3D quiescent spheroid cells. Accordingly, the glycolytic inhibitors iodoacetate and gossypol were more effective than mitochondrial inhibitors in decreasing HH-cancer cell viability. Under HH, stem cell-, angiogenic-, and EMT-biomarkers, as well as glycoprotein-P content and invasiveness, were also enhanced. These observations indicate that HH cancer cells develop an attenuated Warburg and pronounced EMT- and invasive-phenotype.

Despite major advances in the field, there is no curative therapy for GB to date. Many solid tumors, including GB, experienced metabolic reprogramming in order to sustain uncontrolled proliferation, hypoxic conditions, and angiogenesis. PPARs, member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily, are particularly involved in the control of energetic metabolism, particularly lipid metabolism, which has been reported deregulated in gliomas. PPARa was previously indicated by us as a potential therapeutic target for this neoplasm, due to the malignancy grade dependency of its expression, being particularly abundant in GB. In this work, we used a new PPAR alpha antagonist on patient-derived GB primary cells, with particular focus on the effects on lipid metabolism and response to radiotherapy. The results obtained demonstrated that blocking PPARa results in cell death induction, increase of radiosensitivity, and decrease of migration. Therefore, AA452 is proposed as a new adjuvant for the gold standard therapies for GB, opening the possibility for preclinical and clinical trials for this class of compounds.

Atomic force microscopy revealed that EW caused damage to E. coli membranes. To understand the metabolic responses to EW perturbations in of E. coli, multivariate data analysis of NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that EW significantly influenced the metabolic state. This included reducing nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis, suppressing energy-associated metabolism, altering osmotic adjustment, and promoting fatty acid metabolism. The results enrich our understanding of E. coli metabolic changes caused by EW perturbation and support the effectiveness of the NMR metabolomics as a valuable tool to analyse and evaluate such a complex biological system.

Despite the commercial potential of these species, there are few studies on the survival and adaptability of juveniles in plantations. The present study dealt with survival, growth, and ecophysiological response of juvenile clonal plants of these species, cultivated in abandoned pastures in M,rida, Venezuela. Survivorship, growth (height and culm diameter), and ecophysiological parameters were monitored the first year during wet and dry seasons. Survival rates were high in both species (95% in G. amplexifolia and 89% in G. angustifolia). Midday leaf water potentials decreased in both species during dry months (-1.28 to-2.72 MPa in G. amplexifolia and-1.67 to-2.37 MPa in G. angustifolia, respectively). Net photosynthetic rates measured during wet [16.57 +/- 1.40 and 13.68 +/- 2.40 mu mol(CO2) m(-2) s(-1), respectively] and dry seasons [12.19 +/- 2.82 and 8.12 +/- 1.81 mu mol(CO2) m(-2) s(-1), respectively], demonstrated that G. amplexifolia maintained consistently higher photosynthetic rates compared to G. angustifolia, which could explain the higher growth rates of the former. Similar trends were observed for stomatal conductance, transpiration, water-use efficiency, electron transport rate, and photochemical quenching of PSII. G. angustifolia maintained higher nonphotochemical quenching as well as a higher consumption of electrons per molecule of CO2 fixed, indicating a lower photosynthetic efficiency. The maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (0.73-0.76) suggested that neither of these species suffered from photoinhibition, despite persistently high radiation and air temperatures at the study site.","Authors":"Ely, F (Ely, F.) ; Araque, O (Araque, O.) ; Jaimez, R (Jaimez, R.)","Title":"Growth and ecophysiological response in juvenile clones of Guadua (Guaduinae: Bambusoideae) cultivated in an altered lowland tropical region"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398437100012 ISSN: 0300-3604 eISSN: 1573-9058","Keywords":"arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis; carbohydrates; chlorophyll; gas exchange; lipids; mineral nutrition KeyWords Plus:VITIS-VINIFERA L.; GLOMUS-INTRARADICES; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; CARBON METABOLISM; DROUGHT STRESS; SALT STRESS; GROWTH; PHOSPHATE; TRANSLOCATION; TRANSPORT","Categories":"Plant Sciences Web of Science Categories:Plant Sciences","Journal Information":"PHOTOSYNTHETICA Volume: 55 Issue: 2 Pages: 308-316 DOI: 10.1007/s11099-016-0243-5 Published: JUN 2017","Abstract":"In this study, we hypothesized that colonization of olive trees (Olea europaea L.) with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis could modify the profiles of rhizosphere microbial communities with subsequent effects on nutrient uptake that directly affects olive tree physiology and performance.

Four types of internal disorders occurred: core browning, white cavity, necrotic cavity, and flesh browning. Low O-2 reduced ethylene production and respiration rates which were further reduced by the treatment with 1-MCP.

Fruits treated with 150 nL L (1)1-MCP were also stored at 3.0 and 0.5 kPa O-2 after 32 d in air following the treatment. Internal disorders did not develop in fruit stored in air (20.8 kPa O-2) or at 0.5 kPa O-2 but affected 10.2% of the fruit stored in 3.0 kPa O-2 after 136 d. 1-MCP increased disorder incidence at 0.5 and at 3.0 kPa O-2. Four types of internal disorders occurred: core browning, white cavity, necrotic cavity, and flesh browning. Low O-2 reduced ethylene production and respiration rates which were further reduced by the treatment with 1-MCP. ATP concentration and adenylate energy charge were higher in fruit stored in air than in those at 3.0 and were generally lowest in fruit at 0.5 kPa O-2. The effect of pO(2) on energy metabolism prevailed over that of 1-MCP treatment. The linkage between ATP and adenylate energy charge (AEC) and the incidence of internal disorders was not strong, since under the same pO(2), 1-MCP enhanced the incidence of disorders with a negligible effect on adenylate nucleotides or AEC. It was not possible to establish a threshold of ATP concentration or AEC below which internal disorder develop. In conclusion, poststorage quality of 'Rocha' pear was better at the extremely low pO(2) of 0.5 kPa than at 3.0 kPa. 1-MCP was detrimental to internal disorders and blocked poststorage softening of 'Rocha' pear stored at 0.5 kPa O-2.

Intracellular and extracellular constituents were monitored in batch tests under different electron donor and acceptor conditions and specific oxygen and nitrogen uptake rates were evaluated. Results showed that phosphorus uptake was inhibited during the simultaneous presence of electron donor (acetate) and acceptor (02/NO3-) in the mixed liquor. In the presence of acetate, PHAs and glycogen were produced under both aerobic and anoxic conditions irrespectively to the PHAs amount already stored intracellularly. The Krebs cycle reactions and oxidative phosphorylation provided the reduced coenzymes and energy required for PHAs synthesis when biomass polyphosphate content was low. On the contrary, polyphosphate cleavage provided the ATP required for PHAs synthesis in the presence of high biomass polyphosphate content. Inhibition of the respiratory chain reactions was observed when biomass with high polyphosphate and low PHAs content was subjected to simultaneous presence of electron donor and acceptor. PHAs utilization rather than glycogen degradation appears to favor phosphate accumulation since no polyphosphate synthesis occurred in the absence of PHAs reserves. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The identification and quantification of pharmaceuticals in the African water bodies is important to the general public at large due to the lack of information. The consumption of pharmaceuticals to promote human health is usually followed by excretion of these drugs via urine or fecal matter due to their slight transformation in the human metabolism. Therefore, large amounts of pharmaceuticals are being discharged continuously from wastewater treatment plants into African rivers due to inefficiency of employed sewage treatment processes. Large portions of African communities do not even have proper sanitation systems which results in direct contamination of water resources with human waste that contains pharmaceutical constituents among other pollutants. Therefore, this article provides the overview of the recent studies published, mostly from 2012 to 2016, that have focused on the occurrence of different classes of pharmaceuticals in African aqueous systems. Also, the current analytical methods that are being used in Africa for pharmaceutical quantification in environmental waters are highlighted.

However, no one method can obtain metabolomic and lipidomic information in a single analysis. In this work, aiming at collecting comprehensive information on metabolome and lipidome in a single analytical run, we developed an on-line heart-cutting two-dimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (2D-LCMS) method. Complex metabolites from biological samples are divided into two fractions by using a precolumn. The first fraction is directly transferred and subjected to metabolomics analysis. Most lipids are retained on the precolumn until the mobile phases for lipidomics flow through; then they are subjected to lipidomics analysis. Up to 447 and 289 metabolites in plasma, including amino acids, carnitines, bile acids, free fatty acids, lyso-phospholipids, phospholipids, sphingomyelins etc. were identified within 30 min in the positive mode and negative mode, respectively. A comparison of the newly developed method with the conventional metabolomic and lipidomic approaches showed that approximately 99% features obtained by the two conventional methods can be covered with this 2D-LC method. Analytical characteristics evaluation showed the method had a wide linearity range, high sensitivity, satisfactory recovery and repeatability. These results demonstrate that this method is reliable, stable and well qualified in metabolomics analysis, particularly for large-scale metabolomics studies with small amount of samples.

Increasing evidence supports a role for the endocannabinoid system in modulating inflammatory responses including those mediated by TLRs, and thus this system may provide an important treatment target for neuroinflammatory disorders. However, the effect of modulating endocannabinoid tone on TLR-induced neuroinflammation in vivo and associated behavioural changes is largely unknown. The present study examined the effect of inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolyase (FAAH), the primary enzyme responsible for the metabolism of anandamide (AEA), in vivo on TLR4-induced neuroimmune and behavioural responses, and evaluated sites and mechanisms of action. Systemic administration of the FAAH inhibitor PF3845 increased levels of AEA, and related FAAH substrates N-oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and N-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats, an effect associated with an attenuation in the expression of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines and mediators measured 2hrs following systemic administration of the TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These effects were mimicked by central i. c.v. administration of PF3845, but not systemic administration of the peripherally -restricted FAAH inhibitor URB937. Central antagonism of TRPV1 significantly attenuated the PF3845-induced decrease in IL-6 expression, effects not observed following antagonism of CB1, CB2, PPAR alpha, PPAR gamma or GPR55. LPS-induced a robust sickness -like behavioural response and increased the expression of markers of glial activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines over 24hrs. Systemic administration of PF3845 modulated the TLR4-induced expression of neuroimmune mediators and anhedonia without altering acute sickness behaviour. Overall, these findings support an important role for FAAH substrates directly within the brain in the regulation of TLR4-associated neuroinflammation and highlight a role for TRPV1 in partially mediating these effects.(C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The solute carrier SLC38A3, a member of amino acid/polyamine/organocation (APC) superfamily, is an c-glutamine transporter. It is not clear whether SLC38A3 involves the metastasis of NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer). Methods: The scratch test and transwell assay were used to determine the ability of NSCLC to migrate. Cellular amino acids content was determined by mass spectrometry. The cellular response to glutamine/histidine deficiency was evaluated in A549 cells. The expression of SLC38A3 was assayed in clinical NSCLC and paratumor tissues by histoimmunochemistry staining. A nude mouse model of NSCLC metastasis was developed by tail vein injection of tumor cells. Results: SLC38A3 was upregulated in metastatic NSCLC cells and its expression was correlated with prognosis of NSCLC patients. SLC38A3 overexpression promoted epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration of HCC827 and A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells, and accelerated tumor metastasis in mice. We found that SLC38A3 decreased the cellular concentrations of glutamine and histidine, and the deficiency of glutamine or histidine activated PDK1/ART signaling that in turn, triggered NSCLC metastasis. Conclusions: SLC38A3 activated PDK1/AKT signaling and promoted metastasis of NSCLC through regulating glutamine and histidine transport, suggesting SLC38A3 as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of NSCLC.

On the other hand, deprivation of amino acids induces autophagy via inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. We report here that amino acid-induced mTORC1 activity and amino acid deprivation-induced autophagy are regulated by PAQR3, a newly found tumor suppressor. At the cellular level, PAQR3 negatively regulates amino acid-induced activation of mTORC1. The N-terminal end of PAQR3 interacts with the WD domains of Raptor and mLST8 directly. PAQR3 reduces the interaction of mTOR with Raptor and mLST8, thus disrupts formation of intact mTORC1 complex. PAQR3 modulates leucine-induced alteration in cell size. In addition, PAQR3 knockdown reduces amino acid deprivation-induced autophagy. The inhibitory effect of PAQR3 knockdown on autophagy is abrogated by rapamycin treatment, indicating that PAQR3 modulates autophagy via its regulation on mTORC1 signaling. In conclusion, our finding reveals a new mode of regulation of mTORC1 signaling and autophagy by PAQR3 in response to alterations of amino acids. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, our recent study indicated that waterborne and dietborne zinc (Zn) exposure differentially influenced lipid metabolism in a fish species of significance for aquaculture, yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco, but further mechanism remained unknown. The hypothesis of the present study is that autophagy mediated the Zn-induced changes of lipid metabolism of yellow catfish subjected to different exposure pathways. To this end, we cloned key genes involved in autophagy in yellow catfish, explored their mRNA expressions in responses to different Zn exposure pathways. Full-length cDNA sequences of two LC3 subtypes and six ATG4 isoforms were isolated from yellow catfish. More ATG4 members were firstly identified in fish that might have arisen by teleost-specific whole genome duplication events. All of these members shared similar domain structure to their orthologous genes of vertebrates. Their mRNAs were widely expressed in various tissues, but at variable levels. Extra Zn addition in water or diets induced (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of ATG4Da, ATG4Db and LOB. Considering their important roles of these genes in lipid metabolism, ATG4Da, ATG4Db and LC3B may mediate the changes of Zn-induced hepatic lipid metabolism of yellow catfish under different Zn exposure pathways. For the first time, we characterized the full-length cDNA sequences of six ATG4 isoforms and two LC3 subtypes, determined their tissue expression profiles and transcriptional responses to different Zn exposure pathways, which would contribute to our understanding of the molecular basis of autophagy, and also provide new insights into physiological responses to different Zn exposure pathways.

In this study, H-1 NMR was applied to investigate the metabolic disturbance of estuarine oysters Crassostrea hongkongensis under both Cu and salinity stresses. Oysters were exposed to dissolved Cu (50 mu g L-1) at different salinities (10,15 and 25 psu) for six weeks, and the Cu accumulation in the oyster tissues was higher at lowered salinity. Based on the NMR-metabolomics results, disturbances induced by Cu and salinity was mainly related to osmotic regulation, energy metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism, as indicated by the alteration of important metabolic biomarkers such as alanine, citrate, glucose, glycogen, betaine, taurine, hypotaurine and homarine in the gills. At lower salinity, oysters accumulated higher energy related compounds (e.g., glucose and glycogen) and amino acids (e.g., aspartate, dimethylglycine and lysine), with the enhancement of ATP/ADP production and accumulation of oxidizable amino acids catabolized from protein breakdown. With Cu exposure, the synthesis from glycine to dimethylglycine was observed to cope with severe osmotic stress, together with the elevation of lysine and homarine. The effects induced by Cu were much similar for each salinity treatment, but the combination of Cu and salinity turned out to be consistent with the singular salinity effects. Therefore, salinity played a dominant role in affecting the metabolites of oysters when combined with Cu exposure. This study indicated that salinity should be taken into consideration in order to predict the Cu toxicity in estuarine organisms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The impact of two different types of polluted sediment collected from Portman Bay (Spain) on HK, liver and skin gene expression in gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L) exposed for two weeks to the sediments was determined by real time-PCR. The expression levels of different antioxidant enzyme genes [superoxide dismutase (sod) glutathione reductase (gr) and catalase (cat)] and immune-related genes Iinterleukin -1 beta (il-lb), immunoglobulin M (igm), T-Cell receptor (tcr-b), cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2), colony-stimulating factor 1-receptor (csf-lr) and hepcidin (hep)] was analysed. Expression varied depending on both the organ and gene studied: tcr-b, csf-lr and hep genes were down regulated in HK, as were gr, tcr-b and il-lb in liver and gr and il-lb in skin, while cox-2 was up-regulated in skin after exposure to both sediments. Concomitantly, histopathological alterations were also studied in HK, liver and skin. While no significant changes were detected in skin cells of fish reared in aquaria with polluted sediments marked changes in the general morphology of HK and liver were observed, accompanied by a substantial degree of cell death and melano-macrophage centre disorganization.

Among lipids, fatty acids (FM) give information on diet of organisms, since FA of consumer lipids can be related to those of diet; plants and animals vary in their FA signature because of differences in the synthesis of lipids. In this study, lipid content and FA composition in tissues of Antarctic organisms from the Ross Sea (Odontaster validus, Sterechinus neumayeri, Chionodraco hamatus, Trematomus bernacchii, Pygoscelis adeliae) were assessed. Differences in lipid characterisation were found between both species and tissues. The lipid content was highest in C. hamatus liver (3.51%), and lowest in T. bernacchii muscle (0.16%). The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) prevailed in the C hamatus muscle, and among FAs, the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6n3) was the most abundant (20.93%). The C22:6n3 accumulated more in fish and penguin tissues than in invertebrate species. The high contribution of unsaturated fatty acids (>74%) in fish tissues wats related to the low environmental temperature. The fatty acid profile and the essential fatty acids occurrence were also discussed in the light of physiological adaptations and feeding habits of organisms; the relationships with contaminant bioaccumulation were also assessed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of fatty acid composition and fingerprint in a Ross Sea trophic web and their correlation with contaminant concentration. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

As the long-term consequences of developmental arsenic toxicity are poorly known, we carried out a clinical pilot study of survivors of the mass arsenic poisoning of bottle-fed infants in Japan in 1955. Objectives: The purpose was to evaluate the association between developmental arsenic exposure and physical stature and routine blood chemistry reflecting major organ functions more than 50 years later. Methods: The study sample consisted of 50 individuals recruited at two hospitals in Okayama Prefecture, Japan: 27 known poisoning victims (14 men and 13 women), and 23 non-exposed local controls of similar age (10 men, 13 women). We collected information from physical examinations that included routine blood counts and blood biochemistry. Results: The average height of the exposed group was 6.5 cm below that of the unexposed group (p=0.02), while the latter was in accordance with national data for both sexes. In addition, the exposed participants had a higher mean (SD) serum concentration of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 233 (63) U/L than the unexposed participants (191 (44) U/L) (p=0.01). No other statistically significant difference was observed, and liver enzymes were within normal ranges. Conclusions: Adults who had suffered arsenic poisoning during infancy showed decreased height and elevated ALP that suggests abnormalities in bone metabolism possibly induced by arsenic incorporated in the bone matrix.","Authors":"Yorifuji, T (Yorifuji, Takashi) ; Matsuoka, K (Matsuoka, Kenichi) ; Grandjean, P (Grandjean, Philippe)","Title":"Height and blood chemistry in adults with a history of developmental arsenic poisoning from contaminated milk powder"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Review Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398651000024 PubMed ID: 28231547 ISSN: 0013-9351 eISSN: 1096-0953","Keywords":"Xenoestrogens; Dose-response effects; Nonmonotonic responses; Toxicology; Molecular mechanisms KeyWords Plus:ENDOCRINE-DISRUPTING CHEMICALS; MINNOW GOBIOCYPRIS-RARUS; ALPHA GENE-EXPRESSION; BREAST-CANCER CELLS; COUPLED RECEPTOR 30; BISPHENOL-A; IN-VIVO; GONADAL DEVELOPMENT; CRUCIAN CARP; ER-ALPHA","Categories":"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health Web of Science Categories:Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Journal Information":"ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH Volume: 155 Pages: 199-207 DOI: 10.1016/j.envres.2017.02.018 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"Xenoestrogens (XEs) mimic or block the synthesis, metabolism and transport of normal endogenous hormones, disturbing normal endocrine function.

The distribution of a single dose of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-stabilized AgNP was investigated in pregnant rats. Two sizes of AgNP, 20 and 110nm, and silver acetate (AgAc) were used to investigate the role of AgNP diameter and particle dissolution in tissue distribution, internal dose and persistence. Dams were administered AgNP or AgAc intravenously (i.v.) (1mgkg(-1)) or by gavage (p.o.) (10mgkg(-1)), or vehicle alone, on gestation day 18 and euthanized at 24 or 48h post-exposure. The silver concentration in tissues was measured using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The distribution of silver in dams was influenced by route of administration and AgNP size. The highest concentration of silver (mu g Ag g(-1) tissue) at 48h was found in the spleen for i.v. administered AgNP, and in the lungs for AgAc. At 48h after p.o. administration of AgNP, the highest concentration was measured in the cecum and large intestine, and for AgAc in the placenta. Silver was detected in placenta and fetuses for all groups. Markers of cardiovascular injury, oxidative stress marker, cytokines and chemokines were not significantly elevated in exposed dams compared to vehicle-dosed control. NMR metabolomics analysis of urine indicated that AgNP and AgAc exposure impact the carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism. This study demonstrates that silver crosses the placenta and is transferred to the fetus regardless of the form of silver.

To understand the contribution of ETBE and TBA kinetics under varying exposure scenarios to these tumor responses, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was developed based on a previously published model for methyl tertiary-butyl ether, a structurally similar chemical, and verified against the literature and study report data. The model included ETBE and TBA binding to the male rat-specific protein alpha 2u-globulin, which plays a role in the ETBE and TBA kidney response observed in male rats. Metabolism of ETBE and TBA was described as a single, saturable pathway in the liver. The model predicted similar kidney AUC(0-) for TBA for various exposure scenarios from ETBE and TBA cancer bioassays, supporting a male-rat-specific mode of action for TBA-induced kidney tumors. The model also predicted nonlinear kinetics at ETBE inhalation exposure concentrations above similar to 2000ppm, based on blood AUC(0-) for ETBE and TBA. The shift from linear to nonlinear kinetics at exposure concentrations below the concentration associated with liver tumors in rats (5000ppm) suggests the mode of action for liver tumors operates under nonlinear kinetics following chronic exposure and is not relevant for assessing human risk.

This central regulatory system may continually modulate the adaptation of the bone homeostatic system to external challenges. The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis may play a role in the regulation of OPG/RANKL secretion.

Currently, many of the functional clues between these two phenomena are studied under the integrative view of functional stroma-epithelia interaction. It has been proposed that stromal cells, due to their abundance and avidity for glucose, are able to modify the metabolic behavior of an entire solid tumor. In the present study, using a mammary stromal cell line derived from healthy tissue subjected to long-term culture in low (5mM) or high (25mM) glucose, we found that the hyperglycemic condition favors the establishment of a pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant environment characterized by the induction of the COX-2/PGE2 axis. In this condition, epithelial migration was stimulated. Moreover, we also found that stromal-derived PGE2, acting as a stimulator of IL-1 epithelial expression was one of the factors that promote the acquisition of motile properties by epithelial cells and the maintenance of a COX-2/PGE2-dependent inflammatory condition. Overall, our work provides experimental evidence that glucose stimulates a tumor inflammatory environment that, as a result of a functional cross-talk between stroma and epithelia, may be responsible for tumor progression.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of these products on the expression of different factors involved in osteoarthritis (OA) process. Human OA chondrocytes were treated with 1ng/ml IL-1 in the presence or absence of protandim (0-10g/ml) or 6-gingerol (0-10M). OA was induced surgically in mice by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM). The animals were treated weekly with an intraarticular injection of 10l of vehicle or protandim (10g/ml) for 8 weeks. Sham-operated mice served as controls. In vitro, we demonstrated that protandim and 6-gingerol preserve cell viability and mitochondrial metabolism and prevented 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE)-induced cell mortality. They activated Nrf2 transcription factor, abolished IL-1-induced NO, PGE(2), MMP-13, and HNE production as well as IL--induced GSTA4-4 down-regulation. Nrf2 overexpression reduced IL-1-induced HNE and MMP-13 as well as IL-1-induced GSTA4-4 down-regulation. Nrf2 knockdown following siRNA transfection abolished protandim protection against oxidative stress and catabolism. The activation of MAPK and NF-B by IL-1 was not affected by 6-gingerol. In vivo, we observed that Nrf2 and GSTA4-4 expression was significantly lower in OA cartilage from humans and mice compared to normal controls. Interestingly, protandim administration reduced OA score in DMM mice. Altogether, our data indicate that protandim and 6-gingerol are essential in preserving cartilage and abolishing a number of factors known to be involved in OA pathogenesis. J. Cell.

I82T mutation in human Sod2 has been linked to a wide variety of diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases as well as some types of cancers. Yeast wild-type (WT) Sod2 and the mutant Sod2 I91T, which corresponds to the human mutant Sod2 I82T, were cloned in sod2 strain. Residue I82 is conserved among a variety of species, showing that it has a biological importance. To assess the functionality of Sod2 I91T under oxidative stress, yeast cells were shifted from glucose (fermentative metabolism) to glycerol growth medium (respiratory metabolism). Overexpression of both Sod2 WT and Sod2 I91T increased Sod activity, but in long-term, the mutation brought impairment to Sod function. Aconitase, a sensor of superoxide radical production in vivo, had its activity preserved by overexpressions of both Sod2, in lesser extent in sod2Sod2I91T. In respiratory metabolism, sod2Sod2WT and sod2Sod2I91T showed high viability; although, sod2Sod2I91T showed high percentage of cells with mitochondrial function compromised. Moreover, the fitness analysis of mixed cultures showed that sod2Sod2I91T was less robust than WT cells. Although overexpression of Sod2 containing I91T mutation allows higher cell viability, longevity of cells is hampered, showing that in long-term this mutation is not neutral. J. Cell.

We previously reported that an increased level of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in media up-regulated the expression of Dmp1 in primary osteocytes isolated from mouse bones. In the present study, we found that elevated extracellular Pi strongly induced the expression of Dmp1 in osteoblasts and explored its underlying mechanism of action. In an osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1, increases in extracellular Pi induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and up-regulated the expression of Dmp1, fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2), and Fgf receptor 1 (Fgfr1). A co-treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126 abolished the increase in the expression of Dmp1 and Fgfr1 by elevated Pi, suggesting the involvement of the MEK/ERK pathway in this up-regulation. Elevated extracellular Pi also resulted in the phosphorylation of FGF receptor substrate 2 (FRS2), which was diminished by knockdown of Slc20a1 encoding Pit1 sodium-phosphate co-transporter. The co-treatment with an inhibitor against FGFR (SU5402) abolished the up-regulation of Dmp1 induced by elevated extracellular Pi. In primary osteoblasts, a treatment with 4mM Pi transiently increased the expression of early growth response 1 (Egr1) before the up-regulation of Dmp1. These results indicate that FGFR mediates the direct effects of extracellular Pi on the expression of Dmp1 in osteoblasts and enhance the close relationship between the signaling evoked by elevated extracellular Pi and FGF/FGFR signaling.

To identify the possible proteins involved in the progression to alcoholic hepatosteatosis, we performed proteomic analysis on livers of mice exposed to alcohol. 2D-based proteomic analysis revealed that EtOH exposure in mice changed the expression of 43 proteins compared with that in mice fed a normal diet (ND). The most notable protein changes were proteins involved in Met metabolism and oxidative stress, most of which were significantly downregulated in alcohol-exposed animals. Although non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD) seem to share the same molecular processes, the difference between these conditions is still unclear. To address this question, we explored the features of alcoholic hepatosteatosis that were different compared with those of methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet-induced mice with nonalcoholic liver damage. Although most of the differentially expressed proteins associated with ALD did not significantly differ from those of NAFLD, nine proteins showed considerably different patterns. Of these, ornithine aminotransferase, vitamin D binding protein, and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein were considerably upregulated in ALD mice, compared to that in NAFLD and ND mice. However, other proteins including inorganic pyrophosphatase were differentially regulated in MCD mice; however, they did not differ significantly between the alcoholic model and ND control mice. These results suggested that the identified proteins might be useful candidate markers to differentiate ALD from NAFLD. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 1189-1200, 2017.

However, energy production is not the major reason for this correlation. Here, using HeLa cells as a model for cancer, we demonstrate that phosphofructokinase-P (PFK-P), which is overexpressed in diverse types of cancer including HeLa cells, modulates expression of P44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Silencing of PFK-P did not alter HeLa cell viability or energy production, including the glycolytic rate. On the other hand, silencing of PFK-P induced the downregulation of p44/42 MAPK, augmenting the sensitivity of HeLa cells to different drugs. Conversely, overexpression of PFK-P promotes the upregulation of p44/42 MAPK, making the cells more resistant to the drugs. These results indicate that overexpression of PFK-P by cancer cells is related to activation of survival pathways via upregulation of MAPK and suggest PFK-P as a promising target for cancer therapy.

As demonstrated in this review, heterotrophic conditions can enhance the biomass concentration by as much as 25-fold compared with phototrophic conditions. Currently, these types of cultivation are economically feasible only for high-value products, including polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), pigments, antioxidants, polysaccharides, food and aquaculture feed from carbon sources, such as glucose, acetate or glycerol. To make heterotrophic cultivation economically viable for high-volume, low-value commodities, such as biofuels, the use of unconventional carbon sources, such as food and agricultural wastes and wastewater, is recommended. Since microalgae are capable of modifying their metabolism according to varying culture conditions, it is possible to modify, control and therefore maximize the production of target compounds.

Our main goal was to propose that the obtained raisins are a good source of bioactive antioxidants. The 'Flame' red variety had the highest amount of total phenols when compared to white raisins (TSP = 201 +/- 13 and 154 28 mg gallic acid equivalent/100 g DW raisins, respectively). The sun drying of fresh grapes produced an increased amount of phenolic acids and flavonoids (rutin, kaempferol-hexoside, quercetin and isoquercitrin). Multiple regression analysis (MRA), principal components (PC) and factor analysis (FA) showed a high correlation between the phenolic profile and the antioxidant activity (AA) of raisins (r >= 0.90, p < 0.05). The 'Flame' variety showed the highest AA, which was linked to the amount of gallic acid, astilbin, quercetin-3-O-glucuronide, isorhamnetin, and isorhamnetin-hexoside present in.this variety. On the other hand, the AA in the 'Arizul' variety was better correlated with the content of (+)-catechin, caftaric and fertaric acids, whereas the 'Sultanina' variety was correlated with resveratrol.

In this study, we analyzed the anti-HCV activity of L-carnitine, a substance involved in the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria. JFH-1 or HCV replicontransfected Huh7.5.1 cells were treated with or without L-carnitine to examine its anti-HCV effects. The effects of L-carnitine on HCV entry, HCV-induced adipogenesis and lipid droplet formation, and HCV-induced oxidative stress were examined. Treatment of JFH1-infected cells with L-carnitine inhibited HCV propagation in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, L-carnitine had no antiHCV activity in the HCV replicon system, which is lacking viral assembly. In addition, Lcarnitine did not affect HCV entry. However, Lcarnitine treatment decreased intracellular lipid droplets, which are crucial for HCV assembly in JFH-1-infected cells. The expression level of CPT-1 was decreased in JFH-1-infected cells, and L-carnitine treatment restored this expression. HCV-infected cells exhibited increased production of reactive oxygen species and glutathione oxidation. L-carnitine decreased oxidative stress induced by JFH-1-infection, as shown by glutathione/glutathione disulfide assays and MitoSOX staining. L-carnitine exhibited anti-HCV activity, possibly by inhibiting HCV assembly and through its anti-adipogenic activity in HCV-infected cells. Moreover, L-carnitine has antioxidant properties in HCVinfected hepatocytes. Overall, these results indicated that L-carnitine may be an effective adjunctive agent in antiviral therapies to treat chronic hepatitis C.

The present study was focused on the interference of lipid metabolism by P-MNPs under 0.5 T static magnetic fields (SMFs) in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). The P-MNPs were accumulated in the intestine of nematodes, where fatty acids are accumulated. The content of lipofuscin was decreased in C. elegans exposed to either P-MNPs or SMF, while there were no further decrease in worms with P-MNPs+ SMF exposure. However in the presence of SMF, the lipid content was greatly decreased in C. elegans in the P-MNPs+ SMF exposure groups. The constituents of long-chain fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) were significantly decreased in P-MNPs treated worms under 0.5 T SMF, which was consistent with the mRNA expression of fatty acid metabolism genes including elo-2, let-767 and fat-5.

These functions depend on the dynamic and highly regulated metabolism of phosphoinositides and require finely balanced activity of specific phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases. There is increasing evidence from genetic and functional studies that these enzymes are often dysregulated or mutated in autism spectrum disorders; in particular, phosphoinositide 3-kinases and their regulatory subunits appear to be affected frequently. Examples of autism spectrum disorders with defective phosphoinositide metabolism are fragile X syndrome and autism disorders associated with mutations in the phosphoinositide 3-phosphatase tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), but recent genetic analyses also suggest that select nonsyndromic, idiopathic forms of autism may have altered activity of phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases. Isoform-specific inhibitors for some of the phosphoinositide kinases have already been developed for cancer research and treatment, and a few are being evaluated for use in humans. Altogether, this offers exciting opportunities to explore altered phosphoinositide metabolism as a therapeutic target in individuals with certain forms of autism. This review summarizes genetic and functional studies identifying defects in phosphoinositide metabolism in autism and related disorders, describes published preclinical work targeting phosphoinositide 3-kinases in neurological diseases, and discusses the opportunities and challenges ahead to translate these findings from animal models and human cells into clinical application in humans.

A specialized 2D bSSFP sequence was implemented on a clinical 3T scanner and used to obtain the first high resolution T-2 maps of these different hyperpolarized compounds in both rats and tumor-bearing mice. These maps were first used to optimize timings for highest SNR for single time-point 3D bSSFP acquisitions with a 1.5 mm isotropic spatial resolution of normal rats. This 3D acquisition approach was extended to serial dynamic imaging with 2-fold compressed sensing acceleration without changing spatial resolution. The T-2 mapping experiments yielded measurements of T-2 values of >1 s for all compounds within rat kidneys/vasculature and TRAMP tumors, except for [2-C-13]pyruvate which was similar to 730 ms and similar to 320 ms, respectively. The high resolution 3D imaging enabled visualization the biodistribution of [1-C-13]lactate, [1-C-13]pyruvate, and [2-C-13]pyruvate within different kidney compartments as well as in the vasculature. While the mouse anatomy is smaller, the resolution was also sufficient to image the distribution of all compounds within kidney, vasculature, and tumor. The development of the specialized 3D sequence with compressed sensing provided improved structural and functional assessments at a high (0.003 cm(3)) spatial and 2 s temporal resolution in vivo utilizing HP C-13 substrates by exploiting their long T-2 values. This 1.5 mm isotropic resolution is comparable to H-1 imaging and application of this approach could be extended to future studies of uptake, metabolism, and perfusion in cancer and other disease models and may ultimately be of value for clinical imaging.

Specimens of muscle tissue were obtained from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) [n = 11; Age, Mean +/- SD; 9.2 +/- 1.4 years; all were males], Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) [n = 12; Age, Mean +/- SD; 21.4 +/- 5.0 years; all were males], facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) [n = 11; Age, Mean +/- SD; 23.7 +/- 7.5 years; all were males] and limb girdle muscular dystrophy-2B (LGMD-2B) [n = 18; Age, Mean +/- SD; 24.2 +/- 4.1 years; all were males]. Muscle specimens were also obtained from [n = 30; Mean age +/- SD 23.1 +/- 6.0 years; all were males] normal/control subjects. Results: Assigned lipid components in skeletal muscle tissue were triglycerides (TG), phospholipids (PL), total cholesterol (CHOL) and unsaturated fatty acids (arachidonic, linolenic and linoleic acid)]. Quantity of lipid components was observed in skeletal muscle tissue of DMD, BMD, FSHD and LGMD-2B patients as compared to control/normal subjects. TG was significantly elevated in muscle tissue of DMD, BMD and LGMD-2B patients. Increase level of CHOL was found only in muscle of DMD patients. Level of PL was found insignificant for DMD, BMD and LGMD-2B patients. Quantity of TG, PL and CHOL was unaltered in the muscle of patients with FSHD as compared to control/normal subjects. Linoleic acids were significantly reduced in muscle tissue of DMD, BMD, FSHD and LGMD-2B as compared to normal/control individuals. Conclusions: Results clearly indicate alteration of lipid metabolism in patients with muscular dystrophy in early phase of the disease. Moreover, further evaluation is required to understand whether these changes are primary or secondary to muscular dystrophy. In future, these findings may prove an additional and improved approach for the diagnosis of different forms of muscular dystrophy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, F. verticillioides produces toxic secondary metabolites during kernel colonization that pose significant threats to human and animal health. Fusarium verticillioides and other plant-pathogenic fungi possess a large number of genes with no known or predicted function, some of which could encode novel virulence factors or antifungal targets. In this study, we identified and characterized the novel gene FUG1 (Fungal Unknown Gene 1) in F. verticillioides through functional genetics. Deletion of FUG1 impaired maize kernel colonization and fumonisin biosynthesis. In addition, deletion of FUG1 increased sensitivity to the antimicrobial compound 2-benzoxazolinone and to hydrogen peroxide, which indicates that FUG1 may play a role in mitigating stresses associated with host defence. Transcriptional profiling via RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) identified numerous fungal genes that were differentially expressed in the kernel environment following the deletion of FUG1, including genes involved in secondary metabolism and mycelial development. Sequence analysis of the Fug1 protein provided evidence for nuclear localization, DNA binding and a domain of unknown function associated with previously characterized transcriptional regulators. This information, combined with the observed transcriptional reprogramming in the deletion mutant, suggests that FUG1 represents a novel class of fungal transcription factors or genes otherwise involved in signal transduction.","Authors":"Ridenour, JB (Ridenour, John B.) ; Bluhm, BH (Bluhm, Burton H.)","Title":"The novel fungal-specific gene FUG1 has a role in pathogenicity and fumonisin biosynthesis in Fusarium verticillioides"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Review Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396955800001 PubMed ID: 28174023 ISSN: 0197-0186 eISSN: 1872-9754","Keywords":"Hydrogen sulphide; Stroke; Toxic effect; Neuroprotection KeyWords Plus:CYSTATHIONINE-BETA-SYNTHASE; CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION INJURY; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM STRESS; ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION INJURY; BRAIN-BARRIER INTEGRITY; ANIMATION-LIKE STATE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; METHYLENETETRAHYDROFOLATE REDUCTASE; GAMMA-LYASE; HOMOCYSTEINE METABOLISM","Categories":"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Neurosciences & Neurology Web of Science Categories:Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Neurosciences","Journal Information":"NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL Volume: 105 Pages: 1-10 DOI: 10.1016/j.neuint.2016.11.015 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"Hydrogen sulfide is believed to be a signalling molecule in the central nervous system.

It is already known that advanced PD patients manifesting dyskinesia are featured by the high homovanillic acid (HVA)/dopamine (DA) ratio, suggesting the increased turnover of DA in these patients. Less clear is whether similar changes affect mild and moderate stages of the disease (between 1 and 2.5 of Hoehn & Yahr-H&Y-stage). Hence, here we tested whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of DA and its major metabolites, either 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) or HVA, correlate with motor performance in mild and moderate PD patients. CSF samples were collected after 2 days of anti-PD drugs washout, via lumbar puncture (LP) performed 130 min following administration of oral levodopa (LD) dose (200 mg). LP timing was determined in light of our previous tests clarifying that 2 h after oral LD administration CSF DA concentration reaches a plateau, which was un-respective of PD stage or duration. DA, DOPAC and HVA were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography in a group of 19 patients, distributed in two groups on the basis of the H&Y stage with a cut-off of 1.5. In these PD patients, HVA was correlated with DOPAC (R = 0,56, p < 0,01) and both HVA and DOPAC CSF levels increased in parallel with the motor impairment. More importantly, HVA correlated with motor impairment measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Score III (UPDRS) (R = 0.61; p < 0.0001). The present findings showed the early alteration of the DA pre-synaptic machinery, as documented by the progressive increase of CSF HVA concentrations, which also correlated with PD motor impairment.

RCysSNO undergo with cysteine thiols (RCysSH) S-transnitrosation reactions, thereby transferring reversibly their nitrosyl (+NO) group to RCysSH to form RCysSNO. (NO)-N-center dot release from RCysSNO and S-transnitrosation are considered the most important features and signalling pathways of RCysSNO. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S: p/K-a1, 7; HS-: pK(a2), 12.9) is an endogenous product of cysteine metabolism. We hypothesized that RCysSNO would also undergo S-transnitrosation reaction with H2S/HS-/S2- to form thionitrite (ONS-), the smallest S-nitrosated thiol. This article describes spectrophotometric and mass spectrometric investigations of S-transnitrosation reactions in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) of pH 7.4 between H2S/HS-/S2- (supplied as Na2S) and S-nitroso-glutathione (GSNO), S-nitroso-L-cysteine (CysSNO), S-nitroso-N-acetyl-L-cysteine (SNAC), and the synthetic S-nitroso-N-acetyl-L-cysteine ethyl ester (SNACET). For comparison, we also investigated the reactions of H2S/HS-/S2- with NO+BF4- and NO2+BF4-, direct ON+ and O2N+ donors, respectively, and assumed formation of ONS- and thionitrate (O2NS-), respectively. Addition of Na2S (at 1 mM) to buffered RCysSNO solutions resulted in decreases of the absorbance at 340 nm and concomitant increases in the absorbance at 410 nm depending upon the nature and concentration of RCysSNO (range, 25-1000 mu M). The reactivity order of RCysSNO against H2S/HS-/S2- was: CysSNO > SNACET > GSNO > SNAC. Our spectrophotometric and GC-MS analyses indicate that H2S/HS-/S2- and RCysSNO undergo multiple reactions. Major final reaction products were found to be nitrite and nitrate. ONS- and O2NS- were not detected by GC-MS, suggesting rapid and complete S/O-exchange from water at pH 7.4. GC-MS analyses of ethyl acetate extracts of reaction mixtures suggested formation of tetrasulfur (S-4), the precursor of elemental sulfur (S-8). The broad absorbance around 410 nm and the turbidity occurred in RCysSNO/Na2S reaction mixtures support formation of polysulfides (polysulfanes) and colloidal sulfur. The reaction of NO+BF4- and NO2+BF4- with H2S/HS-/S2- differed from the S-transnitrosation reactions of RCysSNO, with NO+BF4- being more reactive than NO2+BF4-. In this article, we also briefly review and discuss recent published work dealing with the reaction of H2S/HS-/S2- with low- and high-molecular-mass S-nitrosated thiols. This research area is highly challenging and controversial with respect to the primarily formed reaction products. The synthesis of structurally well-characterized, pure stable-isotope labelled species of putative reaction products, including ONS-, O2NS- and ONSS-, and their use in combination with mass spectrometry coupled to chromatography, e.g. GC-MS and LC-MS/MS, are indispensable in exploring the complex interaction of the two gasotransmitters, H2S and (NO)-N-center dot.

The rice bran enzymatic extract (RBEE) previously showed vessel remodeling prevention and lipid-lowering, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic activities. The aim of this study was to identify RBEE hypolipidemic mechanisms and to study the effects of RBEE on the progression of atherosclerosis disease and linked vascular dysfunction and liver steatosis in apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE-/-) mice fed low-or high-fat (LFD, HFD, respectively) and cholesterol diets. Methods: AkoE-/- mice were fed LFD (13% kcal) or HFD (42% kcal) supplemented or not supplemented with 1 or 5% RBEE (w/w) for 23 wk. Then, serum, aorta, liver, and feces were collected and flash frozen for further analysis. Results: RBEE supplementation of HFD improved serum values by augmenting high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and preventing total cholesterol and aspartate aminotransferase increase. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity was attenuated (1 and 5% RBEE) and cholesterol excretion increased (5% RBEE). Diet supplementation with 5% RBEE reduced plaque development regardless of the diet. In HFD-fed mice, both doses of RBEE reduced lipid deposition and macrophage infiltration in the aortic sinus and downregulated intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression. None of these effects was observed in mice fed LFD. Liver steatosis was reduced by RBEE supplementation of LFD (1% RBEE) and HFD (1 and 5% RBEE) and nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha expression upregulated in the HDF 5% RBEE group. Conclusion: Regular consumption of RBEE-supplemented HFD reduced plaque development and liver steatosis by decreasing inflammation and hyperlipidemia through an HMG-CoA reductase activity and lipid excretion-related mechanism. 2016 Elsevier Inc.

While bariatric surgery leads to significant weight loss, it can exacerbate or prolong Vitamin D deficiency. We systematically reviewed the literature to assess whether secondary hyperparathyroidism is maintained in the medium to long term in patients following the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. MethodsA comprehensive literature search was conducted through Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Dare, Cochrane library and HTA database. The search terms used were bariatric surgery, gastric bypass and hyperparathyroidism. ResultsFourteen studies were included (n=2688 subjects). Parathyroid hormone levels rose gradually from a mean pre-operative level of 5.691.2pmol/L to 6.36 +/- 0.77pmol/L, 7.59 +/- 0.73pmol/L and 8.29 +/- 1.41pmol/L at 2years, between 2 and 5years, and beyond 5years, respectively. Vitamin D levels slowly fell to a mean of 20.50 +/- 4.37ng/mL and 20.76 +/- 3.80ng/mL between follow-up intervals 2-5years and beyond 5, respectively.

The study of new compounds based on liquid bioassimilable sulphur and its effect as an inductor of the immune system of plants would provide an alternative option to farmers to enhance plant resistance against pathogen attacks such as powdery mildew. In order to elucidate the efficacy of this compound in tomato against powdery mildew, we tested several treatments: curative foliar, preventive foliar, preventive in soil drench and combining preventive in soil drench and curative foliar. RESULTS: In all cases, treated plants showed lower infection development, better physiological parameters and a higher level of chlorophyll. We also observed better performance in parameters involved in plant resistance such as antioxidant response, callose deposition and hormonal levels. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that preventive and curative treatments can be highly effective for the prevention and control of powdery mildew in tomato plants. Foliar treatments are able to stop the pathogen development when they are applied as curative. Soil drench treatments induce immune response mechanisms of plants, increasing significantly callose deposition and promoting plant development.

In this way, predation imposes a cost to animals, not only through direct consumption, but also as an energetic cost. One way used to estimate this cost in the past has been to measure the production of CO2 to estimate the change in metabolic rate because of predation. It has been proposed that this change is mediated by the insect stress neurohormone octopamine. Here we study the change in metabolic rate of the black field cricket (Teleogryllus commodus), and how the production of CO2 varies when a chemical cue from a sympatric predator is added. We hypothesised that after the addition of a predatory cue, the metabolic rate will increase. Moreover, since the pressure of predation is stronger on females, we propose that females will have a greater increase in the CO2 produce as consequence of the added cues from the predator. Our results confirmed our first hypothesis, showing an almost two-fold increase in CO2 when the predatory cue was added. However, males were the ones that showed a greater increase, in opposition to our second hypothesis. We put these results in the context of the escape theory and, in particular, the \"landscape of fear\" hypothesis. Also, because the timing between the increase of metabolic rate we measure here and the release of octopamine reported in previous studies do not match, we reject the idea that octopamine causes the increase in metabolism.

However, little is known about treating or diagnosing early impairments in mHE. We studied one of its precipitating factors, portal hypertension which is driving the inflammatory process behind mHE. The purpose was to describe an indirect diagnostic method able to detect the pathology at early stages based on the study of the vascularization and mast cells conjunctival hyperplasia as secondary inflammatory response associated to portal hypertension. Finally, we correlated the presence of histological changes in the eye in mHE with deficits in behavioral task acquisition. Methods: Rats were trained on a stimulus-response task and a spatial working memory task using the Morris water maze. Two groups of animals were used: a SHAM (sham-operated) group (n = 10) and a portal hypertension (HT) group (n = 10). The triple portal vein ligation method was used to create an animal model of mHE. Latencies to reach the platform, number of glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive astrocytes (GFAP-IR), mast cell expression and presence/absence of blood and lymphatic vessels were examined. Results: There were differences in stimulus-response behavioral performance, with a deficit in the acquisition in the HT group. However, no differences between groups were found on the spatial working memory task. At the same time, differences between groups were found in the GFAP-IR density, which was lower in the HT group, and in the number of mast cells and the presence of vesselS, which were higher in the HT group. Conclusions: In this study, we provide the first preliminary insight into the Validity of exploring the eye as a possible tool to assess the diagnosis of mHE conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Storage conditions were: [ 1] Controlled atmosphere (CA) (1.2 kPa O-2 + 2.0 kPa CO2); [ 2] CA + 1methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) (0.625 mu LL (1)); [ 3] Dynamic controlled atmosphere based on respiratory quotient 1.3 (DCA-RQ 1.3) + 1.2 kPa CO2 and [ 4] DCA-RQ 1.5 + 1.2 kPa CO2.

Highest ester concentrations occurred in overripe fruit stored at DCA-RQ 1.3 and DCA-RQ 1.5. 1-MCP application suppressed volatile compound production, not allowing its increment with advanced of the maturity stage and reduced the main esters after storage. DCA-RQ suppressed internal ethylene concentration, ethylene production, and respiration rate, but the low metabolism in fruit stored under DCA-RQ 1.5 did not result in lower volatile compound production.

In order to elucidate common and divergent processes characterizing the metabolic changes under hypoxia, fruit of two apple (Malus domestica) varieties ('Granny Smith', GS, and 'Red Delicious', RD) were stored under two different low oxygen protocols (Ultra Low Oxygen, ULO, at 0.9 kPa oxygen, and Dynamic Controlled Atmosphere based on chlorophyll fluorescence, DCA-CF, between 0.2 and 0.55 kPa oxygen) for up to 200 and 214 days of storage for GS and RD samples, respectively. Through an integrated metabolomics approach (1H NMR, GC-MS, HS-SPME-GC-MS analyses) a total of 130 metabolites (volatiles and non-volatiles) were identified. Most of them (117) were common to both cultivars; 95 were significantly different between both cultivars when comparing the whole set of data (ULO+DCA-CF), whereas 13 volatile compounds, identified via HS-SPME-GC-MS, were specific for either GS or RD. Multivariate analyses (PCA and PLS) of the whole dataset allowed to clearly discriminate between GS and RD samples. When storage condition was used as a categorical response variable, a lower percentage explained variance was obtained as this effect was overshadowed by the large effect of storage time. After 4 months of storage, RD underwent more pronounced metabolic compositional changes of the cortex, possibly associated with the evolution of ripening. Based on the accumulation pattern of pyruvatederived metabolites (ethanol, acetaldehyde, lactate, alanine) it can be hypothesized that there are two main metabolic reconfiguration strategies in GS and RD to regenerate NAD(+) and cope with energy crisis under hypoxia. GS showed more pronounced responses through changes in the nitrogen metabolism and limited induction of the ethanol fermentation while the latter was highly induced in RD under both ULO and DCA-CF. Marked differences were detected between the VOC profiles of the two cultivars regardless storage conditions. Ethyl esters and 2-methylbutyl derivatives appeared finely modulated by the oxygen level in GS and RD apples, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Non-irradiated samples were used as control (CTRL). PAL activity of UV-B and CTRL samples was increased by approximately 760% after 72 h while increases of 120-140% in the remaining radiation treatments were found.

Such phenolics data were highly correlated (R-2 =0.82) to total antioxidant capacity throughout storage. Conclusively, UV-B treatment achieved the highest phenolic compounds accumulation and related antioxidant capacity in shredded carrot during 3 days at 15 degrees C.

Nevertheless, epidemiological studies of zinc administration have provided contradicting results. In order to examine the impact of the artificial intracellular increase of zinc(II) ions on prostate cancer metabolism, PNT1A, 22Rv1, and PC-3 prostatic cell linesdepicting different stages of cancer progressionand their zinc-resistant counterparts were used. To determine benign and malignant metabolic profiles, amino acid patterns, gene expression, and antioxidant capacity of these cell lines were assessed. METHODSAmino acid profiles were examined using an ion-exchange liquid chromatography. Intracellular zinc content was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. Metallothionein was quantified using differential pulse voltammetry. The content of reduced glutathione was determined using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with an electrochemical detector. Cellular antioxidant capacity was determined by the ABTS test and gene expression analysis was performed by qRT-PCR. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONSLong-term zinc treatment was shown to reroute cell metabolism from benign to more malignant type. Long-term application of high concentration of zinc(II) significantly enhanced cisplatin resistance, invasiveness, cellular antioxidant capacity, synthesis of glutathione, and expression of treatment resistance- and stemness-associated genes (SOX2, POU5F1, BIRC5). Tumorous cell lines universally displayed high accumulation of aspartate and sarcosine and depletion of essential amino acids. Increased aspartate/threonine, aspartate/methionine, and sarcosine/serine ratios were associated with cancer phenotype with high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Prostate 77: 604-616, 2017.

The objective of this study is to investigate the hormone content and metabolism of the prostate tissues of patients treated with AA or 5ARI using the ultra-sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. METHODSThirty-nine patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) undergoing transurethral surgery were included. Serum and prostate tissue hormone and prostate tissue hormone metabolism analyses were performed using LC-MS/MS after 1 month of treatment with chlormadinone acetate (CMA; steroidal AA, 50 mg/day) or dutasteride (DUTA; dual 5ARI, 0.5 mg/day). RESULTSSerum testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and adrenal androgen levels were lower in the CMA group than the control group. Prostate tissue T and DHT levels were also lower in the CMA group than the control group. In the DUTA group, only serum and prostate DHT concentrations were reduced compared to the control group; in contrast, those of other hormones, especially T and 4-androstene-3,17-dione in the prostate tissue, showed marked elevations up to 70.4- and 11.4-fold normal levels, respectively. Moreover, the hormone metabolism assay confirmed that the conversion of T to DHT was significantly suppressed while that of T to 4-androstene-3,17-dione was significantly accelerated in the prostate tissue of DUTA-treated patients.

We used H-1-MRS imaging to assess Glx and NAAc, as well as totalcholine (glycerophospho-choline plus phospho-choline), myo-inositol and total-creatine (creatine plus phosphocreatine) from an axial supraventricular slab of gray matter (GM, medial-frontal and medial-parietal) and white matter (WM, bilateral-frontal and bilateralparietal) voxels. Schizophrenia subjects (N = 104) and healthy controls (N = 97) with a broad age range (16 to 65) were studied. In schizophrenia, Glx was increased in GM (P < .001) and WM (P = .01), regardless of age. However, with greater age, NAAc increased in GM (P < .001) but decreased in WM (P < .001) in schizophrenia. In patients, total creatine decreased with age in WM (P < .001). Finally, overall cognitive score correlated positively with WM neurometabolites in controls but negatively in the schizophrenia group (NAAc, P < .001; and creatine [ only younger], P < .001). We speculate the results support an ongoing process of increased glutamate metabolism in schizophrenia. Later in the illness, disease progression is suggested by increased cortical compaction without neuronal loss (elevated NAAc) and reduced axonal integrity (lower NAAc). Furthermore, this process is associated with fundamentally altered relationships between neurometabolite concentrations and cognitive function in schizophrenia.","Authors":"Bustillo, JR (Bustillo, Juan R.) ; Jones, T (Jones, Thomas) ; Chen, HJ (Chen, Hongji) ; Lemke, N (Lemke, Nicholas) ; Abbott, C (Abbott, Christopher) ; Qualls, C (Qualls, Clifford) ; Stromberg, S (Stromberg, Shannon) ; Canive, J (Canive, Jose) ; Gasparovic, C (Gasparovic, Charles)","Title":"Glutamatergic and Neuronal Dysfunction in Gray and White Matter: A Spectroscopic Imaging Study in a Large Schizophrenia Sample"}]
