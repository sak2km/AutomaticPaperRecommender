But for all the research that has been done in the past 40 years, many practitioners continue to see a disconnect between theory and practice, between the questions researched and the questions that need to be answered. In this roundtable, Martijn Cremers begins by challenging the conventional view that limiting agency costs is the main challenge confronted by boards of directors in representing shareholder interests and, hence, the proper focus of most governance scholarship. Especially in today's economy, with the high values assigned to growth companies, the most important function of corporate governance may instead be to overcome the problem of American short termism that he attributes to inadequate shareholder commitment to long-term cooperation. And he buttresses his argument with the findings of his own recent research suggesting that obstacles to the workings of the corporate control market like staggered boards and supermajority voting requirements may actually improve long-run corporate performance by lengthening the decision-making horizon of boards and the managements they supervise. Vik Khanna discusses Indian Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) spending and its effects in light of a recent law requiring Indian companies of a certain size to devote at least 2% of their after-tax profit to CSR initiatives. One unintended effect of this mandate, which took effect in 2010, was that all Indian companies that were spending more than the prescribed 2% of profits cut their expenditure back to that minimum, suggesting that CSR and advertising are substitutes to some extent, and that such legal mandates can discourage CSR spending by early adapters or leaders. Nevertheless, Khanna also found evidence of social norms developing in support of CSR, including a spreading perception that such spending can help some companies achieve strategic goals. Jeff Gordon closes by arguing that, to the extent investors are short-sighted, their short-sightedness is likely to be justified by their recognition that public company directors have neither the information nor the incentives to do an effective job of monitoring corporate managements. The best solution to the problems with U.S. corporate governance is to replace today's thinly informed directors with activist directors who more closely resemble the directors of private-equity owned firms. Such directors would spend far more time with, and be much more knowledgeable about, corporate management and operationsand they would have much more of their personal wealth at stake in the form of company stock.","Authors":"Chen, IJ (Chen, I-Ju) ; Chen, SS (Chen, Sheng-Syan)","Title":"y Corporate Governance and the Investment Efficiency of Diversified Corporate Asset Buyers"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395625100003 ISSN: 0162-2870 eISSN: 1536-013X","Categories":"Arts & Humanities - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:Humanities, Multidisciplinary","Journal Information":"OCTOBER Issue: 159 Pages: 14-18 DOI: 10.1162/OCTO_a_00279 Published: WIN 2017","Abstract":"David Joselit argues that although the politicization of information and fake news is nothing newfacts, after all, have always been ratified by power, and standards of evidence are historically specificthe mode of its authentication is now in crisis.

We investigate how this global information-processing optimality is related to the local information transfer at each individual-unit level. In particular, we introduce an internal adjustment process of the local information transfer and examine whether the former can emerge from the latter. We propose an adaptive random Boolean network model in which each unit rewires its incoming arcs from other units to balance stability of its information processing based on the measurement of the local information transfer pattern. First, we show numerically that random Boolean networks can self-organize toward near dynamical criticality in our model. Second, the proposed model is analyzed by a mean-field theory.

Under the strategic purity framework, this research adopts a multimethod approach by first utilizing panel of financial and operational data composed of 828 firm-quarter observations and finds that the relationship between a popular industry metric-the trailer-to-tractor ratio ( T2T)-and performance is convex. Empirical results are further explained by interviews with senior executives and industry analysts. This research contributes to theory and practice by first showing that, consistent with the strategic management literature, strategy-driven heterogeneous configuration of common assets may increase performance. Second, we show that strategic purity allows carriers supernormal financial performance, despite the hypercompetitive environment. Third, as the TL industry becomes increasingly conscious of competitive strategies, our study shows that the T2T can be used as a guide for carriers to align their competitive strategy with asset configuration.","Authors":"Jin, Y (Jin, Yao Henry) ; Swanson, D (Swanson, David) ; Waller, M (Waller, Matthew) ; Ozment, J (Ozment, John)","Title":"To Survive and Thrive under Hypercompetition: An Exploratory Analysis of the Influence of Strategic Purity on Truckload Motor-Carrier Financial Performance"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397321200004 ISSN: 0143-6503 eISSN: 1464-3820","Keywords":"competition law; intellectual property law; economic regulation; consumer sovereignty; psychology; legal theory KeyWords Plus:RESALE PRICE MAINTENANCE; CHOICE; PREFERENCES; QUALITY; TRADE; RATIONALITY; COMPETITION; RESTRAINTS; PROTECTION; ECONOMICS","Categories":"Government & Law Web of Science Categories:Law","Journal Information":"OXFORD JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES Volume: 37 Issue: 1 Pages: 75-104 DOI: 10.1093/ojls/gqw009 Published: SEP 2017","Abstract":"Recent reorientations of the paradigms of 20th-century antitrust law have underscored today's post-scarcity regime, with its focus on uncovering and stamping out behaviour that weakens product manufacturers' incentives to invest in the scarcity, uniqueness and authenticity values that everyday goods and services conjure in consumers' minds. Alongside the general intellectual property law developments that support dilution-avoiding business practices, this article identifies recent case law that underlines the ways in which dilution thinking is surfacing in antitrust law. It evaluates the legal implications of such thinking based on a substantial social science literature that reveals the mechanisms by which marketing strategies that focus on a high price, uniqueness and authenticity do their work. As businesses increasingly employ strategies that seek to condense product information into simple decision-making heuristics that deliberately invoke subconscious appeal to persuade, the normative force of consumer choice is called into question. In order to preserve the ability of consumers to effectively choose between alternatives, an increased promotion of intratype competition presents the greatest likelihood of arresting the sea change initiated by antitrust law's dilution revolution. The reason for this finding, as this article demonstrates, resides in the fact that the economic background-the purchasing context-often determines to a significant extent the manner in which consumers decide and act.","Authors":"Kuenzler, A (Kuenzler, Adrian)","Title":"Dilution Law, Vertical Agreements, and the Construction of Consumption"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398013100015 ISSN: 1350-7265 eISSN: 1573-9759","Keywords":"approximate martingale estimating functions; discrete time sampling of diffusions; in-fill asymptotics; normal variance-mixtures; optimal rate; random Fisher information; stable convergence; stochastic differential equation KeyWords Plus:MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; STOCHASTIC DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS; MARTINGALE ESTIMATING FUNCTIONS; SMALL DELTA-OPTIMALITY; DISCRETE OBSERVATIONS; PARAMETRIC INFERENCE; QUASI-LIKELIHOOD; COEFFICIENT; MODELS; SIMULATION","Categories":"Mathematics Web of Science Categories:Statistics & Probability","Journal Information":"BERNOULLI Volume: 23 Issue: 3 Pages: 1874-1910 DOI: 10.3150/15-BEJ799 Published: AUG 2017","Abstract":"Parametric estimation for diffusion processes is considered for high frequency observations over a fixed time interval.

We introduce a Nash equilibrium model of noncooperation in terms of cybersecurity levels of the firms involved, which is formulated, analyzed, and solved using variational inequality theory. The equilibrium of this model then acts as the disagreement point over which bargaining takes place in the setting of the second model, which yields a cooperative solution in which the firms are guaranteed that their expected utilities are no lower than those achieved under noncooperation. Nash bargaining theory is utilized to argue for information sharing and to quantify its monetary and security benefits in terms of reduction in network vulnerability to cyberattacks. The third model in this paper also focuses on cooperation among the firms in terms of their cybersecurity levels, but from a system-optimization perspective in which the sum of the expected utilities is maximized. Qualitative properties are provided for the models in terms of existence and uniqueness results along with numerical solutions to two cases focusing on retailers and financial service firms, since these have been subject to some of the most damaging cyberattacks.

Although many extensions of fault trees have been proposed, they suffer from a variety of shortcomings. In particular, even where software tool support exists, these analyses require a lot of manual effort. Over the past two decades, research has focused on simplifying dependability analysis by looking at how we can synthesise dependability information from system models automatically. This has led to the field of model-based dependability analysis (MBDA). Different tools and techniques have been developed as part of MBDA to automate the generation of dependability analysis artefacts such as fault trees. Firstly, this paper reviews the standard fault tree with its limitations. Secondly, different extensions of standard fault trees are reviewed. Thirdly, this paper reviews a number of prominent MBDA techniques where fault trees are used as a means for system dependability analysis and provides an insight into their working mechanism, applicability, strengths and challenges. Finally, the future outlook for MBDA is outlined, which includes the prospect of developing expert and intelligent systems for dependability analysis of complex open systems under the conditions of uncertainty.

The vast majority of the state-of-the-art solutions to the SRF problem in both stochastic optimization and control involve the theory of stochastic approximation. The premise of the latter family of algorithms is to operate by means of so-called \"small-step\" processes that explore the search space in a conservative manner. Instead of relying on the well-established stochastic approximation theory, we rather advocate a radically different approach that resorts to principles akin to those used in noisy Bisection Search. In deterministic Bisection Search, the main question is to determine a point r located on a line by querying an Oracle about whether the optimal point x* lies to the left or right of a point x. A noisy version of this problem, in which the Oracle gives the correct response with probability p, was studied by Waeber and his colleagues. Inspired by the pioneering work of these authors, and its potential application in stochastic optimization and control, we map the SRF problem to a noisy Bisection Search problem where we solely use the sign information of the samples in order to guide the search. Our solution recursively shrinks the search space by, at least, a factor of kt at each epoch, where d > 2 is a user-defined parameter of the algorithm. Our scheme is based, in part, on the Continuous Point Location with Adaptive d-ary Search (CPL-AdS), originally presented by Oommen and his co-authors. The solution to the CPL-AdS, however, is not applicable here because of the inherent asymmetry of the SRF problem. Our solution invokes a CPLAdS-like solution to partition the search interval into d sub-intervals, evaluates the location of the unknown root e with respect to these sub-intervals using Learning Automata, and prunes the search space in each iteration by eliminating at least one partition.

In theory, ICT is among the sources contributing to the increasing levels of CO2 emissions in terms of production of ICT machinery and devices, energy consumption, and recycling of electronic waste. However, ICT is also expected to reduce CO2 emissions on a global scale by developing smarter cities, transportation systems, electrical grids, industrial processes, and energy saving gains. These two effects work in opposite direction, creating an inverted-U relationship between ICT and CO2 emissions. The aim of this study is to investigate this non-linear relationship between ICT and CO2 emissions on a global scale. Given that global warming is a global issue, it is necessary to look at this relationship in countries at all levels of development. To this end, we use a panel data set consisting of 142 economies, split into 116 developing and 26 developed countries, over the period 1995-2010. The results of our empirical study confirm that the relationship between ICT and CO2 emissions is an inverted U-shaped relationship. Moreover, while for the sample of developing countries, the ICT turning point is well above the mean value, the opposite is true for the sample of developed countries. This implies that many developed countries have already attained the level of ICT development, at which CO2 emissions decreases as the level of ICT development improves further.

However, few have investigated least developed countries (LDCs). Of those that have, their findings tend to be descriptive in nature - falling short of a theoretical contribution grounded in the socioculttral context. The purpose of this paper is to provide a theoretical analysis of E-Commerce adoption in an LDC, Tanzania. Specifically, the study seeks to identify structural practices associated with E-Commerce in Tanzanian SMEs. Using structuration theory and following an interpretivist stance the findings show that Tanzanian SMEs enact three major E-Commerce structural practices: (1) Marketing and image-building through use of websites, (2) Transacting through extensive use of mobile technology (3) Technical problem-solving through establishing partnerships. These practices are informed by organisational and enVironmental factors that define the sociocultural, technological and economic contextual setting. Considerable evidence is found that SMEs use websites in a limited way, as they draw upon their understanding of websites as being incompatible with the Tanzanian cultural bargaining system, which is characterised by cash transactions and face to face bargaining. Websites are viewed primarily as a platform from which SMEs can portray a sophisticated image and advertise/market their products. SMEs use mobile technology extensively, as they draw on the technology's ability to offer transactive capability, mobility and communication. Findings also point to technological challenges which SMEs face from the environment, mainly from a lack of supporting industry and institutional support. SMEs hence establish partnerships with international organisations that can support them in overcoming technological challenges. Partnerships with large ICf organisations require stringent conditions, such as the requirement for SMEs to have certification in order to be affiliated. The study gives practitioners a better understanding of how SMEs perceive E-Commerce in Tanzania amidst organisational and environmental opportunities and constraints, and in so doing practitioners can better design appropriate E-Commerce context-specific policies and interventions that address SME problems. This will ensure that available resources become utilised in a more effective manner without negative consequences. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Online games are played over computer networks, usually over the Internet. Online games entail a number of advantages, such as the ability to connect to multiplayer games, although single-player online games are also rather popular. This exploratory study focused on modeling the determinants of actual use of online game playing. Many researchers have shown perceived enjoyment and flow experience as important drivers of actual use of online game playing. The theory of planned behavior has been used in this study. Data were collected from 1584 Universiti Sains Malaysia students with different backgrounds using a structured questionnaire. The findings show that perceived enjoyment has the strongest influence on actual use. Other Variables found to influence actual usage include the level of perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, attitude, perceived enjoyment, and flow experience. Implications of this research for future researchers will also be discussed. We hope this research will increase researchers' interest in further development in this sector and that the model will assist the games industry to identify factors that increase actual use by players.

An empirical research is executed to test a model based on global and domain-specific values, and attitudes towards trying in explaining usage. Based on 116 valid responses from a sample of digital natives, several alternative models were tested. The proposed model based on the theory Of trying shows that domain-specific values positively influence behaviour and usage of social media.

One of the basic problems we face is how to predict financial developments. Current modelling is clearly insufficient since continuity of autocorrelation oversmoothes the empirical financial data. We prove that geometric probability to chose positive definite continuous covariance by financial data is zero. We also have the empirical evidence for this fact from real stock data. In order to overcome this gap we introduce the novel abc class of semicontinuous covariance functions, which integrates both continuous and discontinuous covariances. The abc class of covariances is much more flexible, powerful, and realistic than its continuous counterpart. It gives answer to the question why financial markets face negative interest rates, cyclic downbreaks, and other difficulties nowadays. As it is clearly illustrated in this paper, the experimenter (e.g. the financial institution) can choose only up to some extent whether abc class member will be positive definite everywhere. To the best knowledge of the authors this fits well to the own Kolmogorov's opinions on axiomatic theory of probability. The Kolmogorov's axiomatic theory of probability was developed as one possible alternative in order to utilize the flexibility of Lebesgue integral in probability theory, but in many experiments e.g. in physics and finance, one should go beyond this axiomatics. That means one should accept negative probabilities (and consequently negative definite covariance functions). In this paper we clarify that the modeler's choice of positive/negative definite functions should be considered within broader Information Theory setup. The introduced abc class is purely topologically defined, with soft regularity conditions on covariances, which are still applicable for increasing and infill domain asymptotics for regression problems, krigihg, and finance. These conditions are related to semicontinuous maps of Ornstein Uhlenbetk (OU) processes. We provide several novel results for optimal design of random fields with abc covariances, random walks in finance, and probabilities of ruins related to shocks (e.g. by earthquakes). In particular, we construct a random walk model with semicontinuous covariance. The novel abc class provides a proper environment for unifying several contradictions on IS/ML model in the economic literature. All mentioned novel economical applications are hardly visible from currently used \"continuous covariance\" framework. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

To support consumers' purchase decisions, how to rank the products through online reviews is a valuable research topic, while research concerning this issue is still relatively scarce. This paper proposes a method based on the sentiment analysis technique and the intuitionistic fuzzy set theory to rank the products through online reviews. An algorithm based on sentiment dictionaries is developed to identify the positive, neutral or negative sentiment orientation on the alternative product concerning the product feature in each review. According to the identified positive, neutral and negative sentiment orientations, an intuitionistic fuzzy number is constructed for representing the performance of an alternative product concerning a product feature. The ranking of alternative products is determined by intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging (IFWA) operator and preference ranking organization methods for enrichment evaluations II (PROMETHEE II). A case study is given to illustrate the use of the proposed method. The comparisons and experiments are further conducted to illustrate the characteristics and advantages of the proposed method. Converting the identified positive, neutral and negative sentiment orientations into intuitionistic fuzzy numbers is a new idea for processing and fusing a large number of sentiment orientations of online reviews. Based on the proposed method, decision support system can be developed to support the consumers' purchase decisions more conveniently. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Because it is difficult to generalize and support planning based on this scattered literature, we conduct a meta-analysis to take stock of the worldwide sample of household WTP for improved drinking water services. Using 171 WTP estimates drawn from 60 studies, we first describe this sample and then examine the potential factors that explain variation in WTP estimates. Our results suggest that households are willing to pay between approximately $3 and $30 per month for improvements in water access. Specifically, in line with economic theory and intuition, WTP is sensitive to scope (the magnitude of improvement in drinking water services), as well as household income, and stated-preference elicitation method. We demonstrate how our results can be used to predict household-level WTP for selected improvements in drinking water access in regions with low coverage, and find that private benefits exceed the cost of provision.

Additionally, no study has considered the link between risk perceptions, threat perceptions and attitudes as possible antecedents of selective exposure in the field of GMOs. The aim of the present research was to fill this gap. Results of a multiple-mediation model showed that people did in fact expose themselves selectively in the field of GMOs: The higher the level of general risk perception they reported, the higher the perceived threat, the more negative their attitude towards GMOs and the greater their inclination to expose themselves to information on the harmful effects of GM food.

The theory of planned behavior (TPB) model is extremely useful for predicting people's food choices and consumption habits. This study included an examination of the public attention to and perceived credibility of mass media food safety information and the perceived risk as background factors in the extended TPB model to predict public intention to take precautions to avoid consuming foods with additives. The empirical results of structural equation modeling analysis with 487 useful samples revealed that the extended TPB model has an increased explanatory power relative to the original model regarding the intention of the public in Taiwan to take precautions to avoid consuming foods that contain additives. In addition to attitudes toward and perceived behavioral control of the consumption of food with additives, the impact of risk perceptions plays an important role in determining an individual's intention to take precautions to avoid consuming foods that contain additives. The attention of an individual to food additive scandal news and their perceived risk determine their attitude toward consuming food with additives. An individual's perceived risk of consuming food with additives was determined through the attention paid to food additive scandal news and the perceived credibility of such news.

Perceived social norms can influence food choice and intake behaviour. However, whether social norms can increase liking and taste perception of food products has not been studied so far. Across two studies, we investigated the impact of on pack social norm messages (no norm, descriptive or injunctive) and focus (taste or health) on choice and liking of salt-reduced products. In Study I, we investigated the effects of on-pack social norm messages on choice of salt-reduced products in an online shelf purchase test (n = 491). In Study II, we investigated the effects of on-pack social norm messages on liking and salt taste perception of salt-reduced products after tasting (n = 194). Results of Study I showed that focus rather than social norms impacted product choice: participants chose soups with a health focused message significantly more than soups with a taste focused message, regardless of social norm condition. Results of Study II showed that, just before tasting, participants expected the soups with the descriptive norm messages to be saltier but not better liked than the other soups. When actually tasting the soups, the descriptive norm messages did not influence salt taste perception nor liking, i.e. all soups were similarly perceived in saltiness and liking. No effects were found of injunctive norms on expectations, perceptions and liking. Implications with regard to theory and practice are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been extensively used in several middleware kinds, such as event notification services and application domains, like infrastructures for air traffic management, power grid control, health information exchange, just to cite some of them. Despite achieving a high loss-tolerance and scalability degrees, gossiping is affected by degraded performances and heavy traffic loads on the network. For this reason, it may be not optimal in applications where reliability must be provided jointly with timeliness and/or in congestion-prone networks. The crucial aspect for improving a gossiping scheme is deciding which nodes should receive a gossiping message, and our driving idea is to adopt a distributed strategic learning logic to determine such nodes in an efficient manner. This is able to resolve gossiping's weakness points and to achieve better performance and reduced traffic loads. This paper describes how to introduced strategic learning in a gossip scheme so as to determine the best set of nodes that can be used to send gossip messages and to optimize their utility. Such a solution has been experimentally assessed through a set of simulations demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposal. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In many applications, such as auctions, frequently used for resource management involving two or more agents competing for the resources, the interacting agents only know their own characteristics and must make decisions while having to estimate the characteristics of the others. When probabilities are assigned for the different types of the interacting agents, this kind of strategic interaction constitutes a Bayesian game. In cases in which it is very difficult to characterize the private information of each agent, the payoffs can be given by approximate (not probabilistic) values, but the concept of Bayesian Nash equilibrium cannot be applied in this context. Fuzzy set theory is an excellent basis for studying this type of game, where the payoffs are represented by fuzzy numbers. When it is the case that there is also uncertainty about such fuzzy numbers, the use of interval fuzzy numbers appears as a good modeling alternative. This paper introduces an approach for interval-based fuzzy Bayesian games, based on interval-valued fuzzy probabilities for modeling the types of agents involved in the interaction. We present two different case studies, namely the (Interval) Fuzzy Bayesian Hiring Game and (Interval) Fuzzy Bayesian Prisoner's Dilemma with Moral Standards, comparing the results obtained with the crisp, fuzzy and interval fuzzy approaches, highlighting a particular case in which the interval fuzzy approach presents a solution although the two other do not.

It lacks stable muddy layers and sophisticated classification of the sedimentation periods and the proportion of sedimentary layering in each period has long been a difficult task for geologists. In addressing this problem, this paper attempts to introduce the theory of climatic cycles driven by astronomical periods from astronomical stratigraphy on the basis of the characteristics of the sedimentation under the turbidity current in the region of study. Through studying the conditions for the formation of the conglomerate layer and the factors of control, we pinpoint the formation of the layer in chronology and differentiate the cycle interface and correlation in the same formation period. Milankovitch analysis is conducted on the sedimentation of the conglomerate layer in the region of study to determine if the stratigraphy cycle of the region is primarily controlled by the eccentricity cycle and calculate MSC1 and MSC2 thicknesses of 189.3 m and 78.05 m, respectively. Milankovitch theory is the primary tool used in the analysis, in conjunction with petrographic analysis. The stratum at the S-4(u) is classified into four IV-grade sequences and 11 V-grade sequences. The information on the dominant cycle frequency is used for wave filtering of the well logs and to determine the significant Milankovitch wave log. With the data from this curve, we may compare the stratigraphy cycle with the characteristics of the standard cycle and classify and compare the sedimentation periods of the conglomerate layers in further detail.","Authors":"Chen, PP (Chen, Panpan) ; Fang, NQ (Fang, Nianqiao) ; Li, CL (Li, Cunlei) ; Liu, JM (Liu, Jianmei)","Title":"A method for the division of the conglomerate depositional cycle under Milankovitch cycles"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397359300023 ISSN: 0955-2219 eISSN: 1873-619X","Keywords":"Hydroxyapatite; Proteins; Calcium phosphate ions; MD simulation KeyWords Plus:DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; OCTACALCIUM PHOSPHATE; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; IN-VITRO; BONE; BIOCERAMICS; DESORPTION; INTERFACES; PEPTIDES; COLLAGEN","Categories":"Materials Science Web of Science Categories:Materials Science, Ceramics","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN CERAMIC SOCIETY Volume: 37 Issue: 6 Pages: 2509-2520 DOI: 10.1016/jjeurceramsoc.2017.02.013 Published: JUN 2017","Abstract":"Protein adsorption plays a key role in determining the biological properties of calcium phosphate biomaterials.

HA (010) surface adsorbed more basic protein. Basic residues play a more important role than acidic residues in the adsorption process, as the basic residues have shown higher absorption energy than acidic residues, and they were more likely to adsorb on HA surfaces than to bind P ions in solution. Most of the active sites of protein, especially for acidic residues, are prefer to interact with HA surface through water molecules. Basic residues are more likely to adsorb onto HA surfaces directly. The presence of Ca, P ions in solution can influence the adsorption behaviors of protein. The formation of Ca, P ion cluster may lead to desorption of proteins. And they can compete with water molecules to bond to HA surfaces, acting as a bridge of protein interacting with HA surfaces instead of water-bridge. This Ca, P ions bridge connection make the adsorption energy of protein weakened. The results of this study provided new information at atomic/molecular level to further interpret the mechanism of protein adsorption on calcium phosphate surfaces with Ca, P ions. It is also helpful for designing new calcium phosphate biomaterials with specific surface properties to adsorb target protein for biomedical applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We derive the leading and next-to-leading order biases and compute them in the context of galaxy ellipticity measurements, extending previous work on maximum likelihood inference for weak lensing. We show that a large part of the bias on these point estimators can be removed using information already contained in the likelihood when a galaxy model is specified, without the need for external calibration. We test these bias-corrected estimators on simulated galaxy images similar to those expected from planned space-based weak lensing surveys, with promising results. We find that the introduction of an intrinsic shape prior can help with mitigation of noise bias, such that the maximum a posteriori estimate can be made less biased than the maximum likelihood estimate. Second-order terms offer a check on the convergence of the estimators, but are largely subdominant. We show how biases propagate to shear estimates, demonstrating in our simple set-up that shear biases can be reduced by orders of magnitude and potentially to within the requirements of planned space-based surveys at mild signal-to-noise ratio. We find that second-order terms can exhibit significant cancellations at low signal-to-noise ratio when Gaussian noise is assumed, which has implications for inferring the performance of shear-measurement algorithms from simplified simulations. We discuss the viability of our point estimators as tools for lensing inference, arguing that they allow for the robust measurement of ellipticity and shear.","Authors":"Hall, A (Hall, Alex) ; Taylor, A (Taylor, Andy)","Title":"Cosmic shear measurement with maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori inference"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398419400039 ISSN: 0035-8711 eISSN: 1365-2966","Keywords":"galaxies: high-redshift; cosmology: theory KeyWords Plus:P(D) FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS; DARK-MATTER HALOS; C II EMISSION; POWER SPECTRUM; STAR-FORMATION; NUMBER COUNTS; SUBMILLIMETER GALAXIES; 21-CM FLUCTUATIONS; LOGNORMAL MODEL; MOLECULAR GAS","Categories":"Astronomy & Astrophysics Web of Science Categories:Astronomy & Astrophysics","Journal Information":"MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY Volume: 467 Issue: 3 Pages: 2996-3010 DOI: 10.1093/mnras/stx203 Published: JUN 2017","Abstract":"In the next few years, intensity-mapping surveys that target lines such as CO, Ly alpha and C II stand to provide powerful probes of high-redshift astrophysics. However, these line emissions are highly non-Gaussian, and so the typical power-spectrum methods used to study these maps will leave out a significant amount of information. We propose a new statistic, the probability distribution of voxel intensities, which can access this extra information. Using a model of a CO intensity map at z similar to 3 as an example, we demonstrate that this voxel intensity distribution (VID) provides substantial constraining power beyond what is obtainable from the power spectrum alone. We find that a future survey is similar to the planned CO Mapping Array Pathfinder (COMAP). Full experiment could constrain the CO luminosity function to the order of similar to 10 per cent. We also explore the effects of contamination from continuum emission, interloper lines and gravitational lensing on our constraints and find that the VID statistic retains significant constraining power even in pessimistic scenarios.","Authors":"Breysse, PC (Breysse, Patrick C.) ; Kovetz, ED (Kovetz, Ely D.) ; Behroozi, PS (Behroozi, Peter S.) ; Dai, L (Dai, Liang) ; Kamionkowski, M (Kamionkowski, Marc)","Title":"Insights from probability distribution functions of intensity maps"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397687300017 ISSN: 0143-8166 eISSN: 1873-0302","Keywords":"Structured light illumination; Absolute surface measurements; 313 scanner; Grey level coding; Reed-Solomon code; Error correcting coding theory KeyWords Plus:SHAPE MEASUREMENT; EXCESS FRACTIONS; FRINGE PROJECTION; PHASE; ALGORITHM; PATTERNS","Categories":"Optics Web of Science Categories:Optics","Journal Information":"OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING Volume: 93 Pages: 146-155 DOI: 10.1016/j.optlaseng.2017.02.002 Published: JUN 2017","Abstract":"Intensity discrete structured light illumination systems project a series of projection patterns for the estimation of the absolute fringe order using only the temporal grey-level sequence at each pixel. This work proposes the Ilse of error-correcting codes for pixel-wise correction of measurement errors. The use of an error correcting code is advantageous in many ways: it allows reducing the effect of random intensity noise, it corrects outliners near the border of the fringe commonly present when using intensity discrete patterns, and it provides a robustness in case of severe measurement errors (even for burst errors where whole frames are lost). The latter aspect is particular interesting in environments with varying ambient light as well as in critical safety applications as e.g. monitoring of deformations of components in nuclear power plants, where a high reliability is ensured even in case of short measurement disruptions. A special form of burst errors is the so-called salt and pepper noise, which can largely be removed with error correcting codes using only the information of a given pixel.

Based on the existing literature of social media and internet public events, this article aims to study China's internet public events through the perspective of social transformation theory, especially theories of the civic society and public sphere. This study has used case study to explore the role that social media play in social change in China through in-depth analysis of 57 typical cases. We found that social media are not only an important information source and means for online civil mobilization, but also provide citizens an open and free space for discussion of internet public events. The impact of social media in promoting social change was reflected in the supervision of governmental, judiciary and other public power; maintenance of justice and protection of disadvantaged groups; attracting the government's attention, urging governmental information publicity and investigation of the events, and promoting social management innovation and institutional change. Social media are a helpful force in the construction of internet public sphere and civil society of contemporary China. Meanwhile, it is necessary to be cautious that social media is also likely to be a breeding ground for nationalist and populist discourses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The commonly used singular perturbation theory (SPT) to solve this problem is based on the accurately reduced system model, which is extremely difficult to be obtained in practical application. To overcome this difficulty, an adaptive dynamic programing-based optimal control algorithm with the simplified actor-critic-identifier structure is developed. A different time scales dynamic neural network (DTSDNN) identifier with a novel updating law derived from a properly designed LyapunoV function is proposed to estimate the unknown system dynamics. Furthermore, the critic NN with an improved adaptive law considering the NN weight estimation error information is designed, which can achieve faster convergent speed compared with the commonly Used gradient method. Lyapunov approach is used to guarantee exponential convergence to a bounded region in the neighborhood of the optimal control and uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability of the closed-loop system. Two examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the developed approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The agreement, therefore, implicitly builds on an expectation of the ecological condition of the natural resource. Game theoretical models often assume that all parties have the same (often perfect) information about the resource and that the exploitation is an equilibrium use of the stock. As stated by experts in natural science, the fish ecology still has many open questions, for example how to predict population dynamics, migration patterns, food availability, etc. In some cases, parties disagree about the state, abundance, and migration of a stock, which can reduce the possibilities of reaching an agreement for exploitation of the stock. This paper develops a model and applies it to the North-East Atlantic mackerel fishery, in order to analyze an IFA under different ecological scenarios, and also combines the model with the economic theory of entry deterrence. The model is used empirically to determine whether the parties with original access to the resource have an advantage when forming an agreement with a new party in having the ability to fish the stock down to a smaller size and thereby prevent another party from entering into the fishery. With a basis in entry deterrence, combined with lack of information, the paper illustrates the obstacles that have made an agreement for the North-East Atlantic mackerel so difficult to achieve.

However, fuzzy logic is an alternative method for solving this problem. In the context of prospecting for suitable areas for the installation of wood panel industries, we propose applying fuzzy logic analysis for simulating the planting of different species and eucalyptus hybrids in Espirito Santo State, Brazil. The necessary methodological steps for this study are as follows: a) agriclimatological zoning of different species and eucalyptus hybrids; b) the selection of the vector variables; c) the application of the Euclidean distance to the vector variables; d) the application of fuzzy logic to matrix variables of the Euclidean distance; and e) the application of overlap fuzzy logic to locate areas for installation of wood panel industries. Among all the species and hybrids, Corymbia citriodora showed the highest percentage values for the combined very good and good classes, with 8.60%, followed by Eucalyptus grandis with 8.52%, Eucalyptus urophylla with 8.35% and Urograndis with 8.34%. The fuzzy logic analysis afforded flexibility in prospecting for suitable areas for the installation of wood panel industries in the Espirito Santo State can bring great economic and social benefits to the local population with the generation of jobs, income, tax revenues and GDP increase for the State and municipalities involved. The proposed methodology can be adapted to other areas and agricultural crops. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Although WQT programs are appealing in theory, the concept has not proved feasible in several attempts between point and nonpoint polluters in the United States. Many application hurdles that create wedges between success and failure have been evaluated in the literature. Most programs, however, face multiple hurdles; eliminating one may not clear a pathway to success. Therefore, we identify and evaluate the combined impact of four different wedges including baseline, transaction cost, trading ratio, and trading cost in the Jordan Lake Watershed program. Unfortunately, when applied to the Jordan Lake program, the analysis clearly shows that a traditional WQT program will not be feasible or address nutrient management needs in a meaningful way. The hurdles individually would be difficult to overcome, but together they appear to be unsurmountable. This analysis shows that there is enough information to pre-identify potential hurdles that could inform policy makers where, and how, the concept might work. It would have saved time, energy, and financial resources if North Carolina had done so before embarking to implement their program in the Jordan Lake Watershed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Little information is known on acesulfame transformation in the presence of oxidants/disinfectants. The acesulfame oxidation by permanganate (Mn(VII)) in water under environmentally relevant conditions was systematically evaluated. The pH of water showed negligible influence in acesulfame oxidation. Inorganic ligand (pyrophosphate) exhibited insignificant effect whereas organic ligands (oxalate, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, and humic acid) exerted obvious suppression on acesulfame oxidation. Natural organic matter in real water had important influence in acesulfame oxidation by Mn(VII). Acesulfame transformation pathways were initiated by the attack of Mn(VII) on double bond of ring via [3+2] addition electrocyclic reaction and rich electron of N moiety through electrophilic reaction, followed by oxidation and hydrolysis reactions to produce TPs. Among them, five TPs were for the first time identified. The ecotoxicity tests uncover higher toxicity of the TPs than acesulfame itself. The study on oxidative transformation of acesulfame by Mn(VII) would illumine comprehensive evaluation of this emerging contaminant. Water treatment plants need to consider cautiously to protect the safety of downstream system when using Mn(VII) to dispose the water resource containing acesulfame or other artificial sweeteners.

Thereinto, the factors which determine the radiative processes, including mu(S-n) for S-0-S-n transitions, Delta E(S-n-T-1) and SOC matrix elements < T-1 | H-SOC| S-n > were calculated. In addition, according to the energy gap law, the absorption-emission Stokes shifts as well as energy gaps between T-1 and S-0 states were also computed to describe the nonradiative decay processes qualitatively. As revealed, compared with six-membered Nheterocyclic compounds, five-membered N-heterocyclic compounds exhibit obvious blue-shifted behaviors, smaller nonradiative decay rate constants and similar radiative decay rate constant, especially complex 2b with the other N atom at the 4-position of five-membered N-heterocyclic ligand, which leads to a maximum hypsochromic shift of phosphorescence band and relatively larger radiative decay rate constant and smaller nonradiative decay rate constant among these complexes.

Second, the intelligent player's evaluation is calculated from pay-offs and local environment by Dempster-Shafer theory. The results indicate that the new strategy-updating method promotes cooperation when intelligent individuals utilize the information of different-strategy neighborhoods. Moreover, the increasing number of intelligent player promotes cooperation level. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that cooperators will finally coexist with defectors no matter what the proportion of intelligence is, which is worthy to think about. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, it was proven that the modulus of Gabor wavelet coefficients follows the Rician distribution and the upper bound of the smoothness index converges to a constant of 0.8455... in the case of a very low signal-to-noise ratio. However, there are two problems in the work of Bozchalooi and Liang. The first problem is that an underlying assumption was made fdr the Rician distribution, namely, that only ohe harmonic is retained by the Gabor wavelet transform. For bearing fault diagnosis by envelope analysis, the frequency of the bearing fault and several of its harmonics are required to assess the severity of the fault, because the number of harmonics in the envelope is directly related to information on the geometrics of the fault. Consequently, there is a contradiction between the Rician distribution and the envelope analysis. To solve the first problem, we have mathematically proven that the ratio of the modulus/squared modulus of Gabor wavelet coefficients to the noise standard deviation/variance follows the noncentral chi/chi-square distribution, which does not require the aforementioned underlying assumption. The second problem is that Bozchalooi and Liang assumed that a bearing fault signal is periodic when they calculated the upper bound of the dimensionless smoothness index. In theory, because of slippage of rollers, a bearing fault signal is not purely periodic but slightly random. To Solve the second problem, we have incorporated cyclostationary analysis into our proof procedure for calculating the upper bound of the dimensionless smoothness index. Moreover, we have redefined the smoothness index as the ratio of the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean of the squared modulus of the Gabor wavelet coefficients, and we have proven that the upper bound of the smoothness index converges to a constant of 0.5614... in the case of a very low signal-to-noise ratio.

The fuzzy matter-element theory is used as a reasoning tool to solve contradictory problems with fuzziness and randomness; while the Monte Carlo simulation method acts as a tool for describing and reducing uncertainty by using probability distributions. The novelty lies in an improvement to both the conventional Deterministic Estimate (DE) approach and existing Risk-Based Estimate (RBE) approaches that mainly focus on the project cost/schedule estimate, as the proposed approach can not only estimate the system safety under uncertainty, but also perform sensitivity analysis. A comprehensive index system consisting of 22 influential factors is developed for the assessment of safety risk of tailings ponds in operation. A confidence indicator theta is proposed to verify the reliability of assessment results. A Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is used as a sensitivity measure to identify significant factors by discovering the sensitivity of the system performance to minor changes in input factors. Six large tailings ponds in China are selected as a case study for assessing the magnitude of safety risk and sensitivity of influential factors, in order to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the developed approach. Results indicate that the developed approach is capable of (i) synthesizing multi source information in decision making, (ii) addressing uncertainty in complex project environments, and (iii) achieving dynamic risk analysis over time. This approach can be used by practitioners in the industry as a decision tool for system safety analysis and assessment under uncertainty, providing insight on improving the safety performance of existing tailings ponds in a continuous manner.

With the increase in online health information search the production of health information on internet is also rapidly increasing. Due to the enormous volume of health information available on internet, it is hard to locate, process and manage the required valuable information effectively often overloading health information seekers. Information overload phenomenon occurs when more information is presented than the ability of information seekers to process and handle the information. Researchers argue that information overload phenomenon is significantly associated with health-related issues of information seekers. Therefore, the aim of this study is to empirically examine how OHI related information overload impacts the psychological state of information seekers and their behavioral intention to continue the use of OHI search. A research model based on Information Processing Theory and Theory of Planned Behavior is developed and tested using the data collected from 380 survey responses. The results show that perceived information overload has a positive impact on information seekers' psychological ill-being influencing their behavioral intention to discontinue the use of OHI search.

Recently, the introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) has gained much popularity by offering vehicle -to home (V2H) technologies to support the sustainable operation of microgrids. Since microgrids often exhibit volatile characteristics due to natural intermittency and uncertainty, it is necessary to maintain the balancing of generation and demand through the proper management of power sharing. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to design an agent-based control framework to ensure the coordinated power management Within the microgrids through effective utilization of EVs. The required agent communication framework is adhered to the graph theory where the control agents interact with each other using local as well as neighboring information and their distributed coordination effectively steers the proportional sharing of real and reactive powers among the inverter-interfaced EVs to maintain the stability of microgrids. The well known Ziegler-Nichols method is used to tune the proportional-integral (PI) controller of the inner current control loop within each individual control agent to perform necessary shared control tasks. A microgrid with solar photovoltaic (PV) and V2H systems is chosen to illustrate the results and it is seen that the proposed scheme improves the system performance in a smarter way through information exchange. Furthermore, the proposed framework is also validated by a comparison with an existing traditional approach and it is found that, the proposed scheme provides excellent robust and faster performance.

Compared with the conventional SIDI injector, the novel heated tip SIDI injector can heat the fuel and increase the fuel temperature in a short time. The relationship and formation among the electromagnetic, thermal, fluid flow and spray fields are analyzed based on coupling theories. The data information interface platform based on the commercial software is used to calculate the key parameters of the novel SIDI injector. The coupling models based on FEM (Finite element method) are established to analyze the comprehensive performances systematically. The systematic experiments are utilized to validate and verify the coupling mechanism and the accuracy of the simulation model. In order to investigate the relationship between the temperature and performances of the injector, the multi-physical fields coupling analysis of the novel heated tip SIDI injector are carried out by simulation and experiments. According to the systematical analysis, it is found that the heat generate from the heater and magnetic circuit is the most significant factor that influence on the electromagnetic field, fluid flow and spray. The experiment and simulation result shows that the maximum temperature on the heater of the SIDI injector is about 160 degrees C, which is sufficient to heat the fuel in the injector chamber to boiling, and the flow pattern moved to a developed cavitation at a higher temperature. The main spray plumes completely disappear as the temperature achieves 120 degrees C, which indicates that the spray has totally collapsed, and the spray particle size can be significantly reduced by increasing the fuel temperature.

The centrifugal compressor is commonly placed upstream of the inlet manifold, and hence, it is exposed to the intermittent flow regime of the inlet valves. Surge phenomena have been well studied over the past decades, and there still remains limited information with regard to the unsteady impact caused by the inlet valves. This study presents an experimental evaluation of such a situation. Engine representative pulses are created by a downstream system comprising a large volume, two rotating valves, a throttle valve, and the corresponding pipe network. Different pulsation levels are characterized by means of their frequency and the corresponding amplitude at the compressor inlet. The stability limit of the system under study is evaluated with reference to the parameter B proposed by Greitzer (1976, \"Surge and Rotating Stall in Axial Flow Compressors-Part II: Experimental Results and Comparison With Theory,\" ASME J. Eng. Power, 98(2), pp. 199-211; 1976, \" Surge and Rotating Stall in Axial Flow Compressors-Part I: Theoretical Compression System Model,\" ASME J. Eng. Power, 98(2), pp. 190-198). B describes the dynamics of the compression system in terms of volume, area, equivalent length, and compressor tip speed as well as the Helmholtz frequency of the system. For a given compressor, as B goes beyond a critical value, the system will exhibit surge as the result of the flow instability progression. The reduced frequency analysis shows that the scroll diffuser operates in an unsteady regime, while the impeller is nearly quasi-steady. In the vicinity of the surge point, under a pulsating flow, the instantaneous operation of the compressor showed significant excursions into the unstable side of the surge line. Furthermore, it has been found that the presence of a volume in the system has the greatest effect on the surge margin of the compressor under the unsteady conditions.","Authors":"Barrera-Medrano, ME (Barrera-Medrano, Maria Esperanza) ; Newton, P (Newton, Peter) ; Martinez-Botas, R (Martinez-Botas, Ricardo) ; Rajoo, S (Rajoo, Srithar) ; Tomita, I (Tomita, Isao) ; Ibaraki, S (Ibaraki, Seiichi)","Title":"Effect of Exit Pressure Pulsation on the Performance and Stability Limit of a Turbocharger Centrifugal Compressor"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398537700002 ISSN: 0742-597X eISSN: 1943-5479","Keywords":"Intelligent planning unit; Built environment; Complexity; System of systems; Physical entities; Refinement process; Internet of things; Agent-based modelling KeyWords Plus:MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION MODEL; ROOFTOP PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEM; SMART OBJECTS; ENERGY PERFORMANCE; DATA-COLLECTION; CONSTRUCTION; BUILDINGS; NANOTECHNOLOGY; METHODOLOGY; PROJECTS","Categories":"Engineering Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Civil","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING Volume: 33 Issue: 3 Article Number: 04016046 DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ME.1943-5479.0000486 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"This paper develops the theory of an intelligent planning unit (IPU) as a new thought process.

Land use planners need to know what values are associated with different landscape characteristics and how value elicitation techniques can inform decisions. We designed a Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) study and surveyed residents of four urbanising suburbs in the Lower Hunter region of NSW, Australia. Participants assigned dots on maps to indicate places they associated with a typology of values (specific attributes or functions considered important) and negative qualities related to green spaces. The marker points were digitised and aggregated according to discrete park polygons for statistical analysis. People assigned a variety of values to green spaces (such as aesthetic value or social interaction value), which were related to landscape characteristics. Some variables (e.g. distance to water) were statistically associated with multiple open space values. Distance from place of residence however did not strongly influence value assignment after landscape configuration was accounted for.

In the past 5 years, progress has been sought in this area by drawing on Bayesian probability theory to describe both social and nonsocial aspects of autism in terms of systematic differences in the processing of sensory information in the brain. The present article begins by synthesizing the existing literature in this regard, including an introduction to the topic for unfamiliar readers. The key proposal is that autism is characterized by a greater weighting of sensory information in updating probabilistic representations of the environment. Here, we unpack further how the hierarchical setting of Bayesian inference in the brain (i.e., predictive processing) adds significant depth to this approach. In particular, autism may relate to finer mechanisms involved in the context-sensitive adjustment of sensory weightings, such as in how neural representations of environmental volatility inform perception. Crucially, in light of recent sensorimotor treatments of predictive processing (i.e., active inference), hypotheses regarding atypical sensory weighting in autism have direct implications for the regulation of action and behavior. Given that core features of autism relate to how the individual interacts with and samples the world around them (e.g., reduced social responding, repetitive behaviors, motor impairments, and atypical visual sampling), the extension of Bayesian theories of autism to action will be critical for yielding insights into this condition.","Authors":"Palmer, CJ (Palmer, Colin J.) ; Lawson, RP (Lawson, Rebecca P.) ; Hohwy, J (Hohwy, Jakob)","Title":"Bayesian Approaches to Autism: Towards Volatility, Action, and Behavior"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398600200006 ISSN: 0143-2095 eISSN: 1097-0266","Keywords":"performance feedback; acquisitions; divestments; slack; resources KeyWords Plus:DIVESTMENT DECISION-MAKING; BEHAVIORAL-THEORY; STRATEGIC PERSISTENCE; EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION; RISK PREFERENCES; FIRM PERFORMANCE; RESEARCH AGENDA; ACQUISITIONS; INDUSTRY; MODEL","Categories":"Business & Economics Web of Science Categories:Business; Management","Journal Information":"STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL Volume: 38 Issue: 5 Pages: 1101-1120 DOI: 10.1002/smj.2544 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"Research summary: Prior literature drawing on the behavioral theory of the firm has not considered how resource constraints impact the direction of organizational change in response to performance shortfalls relative to aspirations. We argue that decreasing financial resources resulting from substantial performance shortfalls and the absence or availability of slack resources together affect the emphasis on different types of organizational change in response to performance shortfalls. Using data on the acquisition and divestment behavior of 530 companies in the information and communications technology sector from 1992 to 2014, we find that the frequency of resource-consuming acquisitions and of resource-freeing divestments are affected differently by performance below aspirations and that these relationships are moderated by the level of financial slack.Managerial summary: This paper examines whether firms respond to performance shortfalls with acquisitions or divestments. We argue and show that the closer the firm is to the aspired level of performance, the more likely it is to respond with resource-consuming acquisitions to close the performance gap, whereas the further it is from aspired performance, the more likely the firm is to respond with divestments to free resources. Financial slack weakens these relationships between performance relative to aspirations and acquisitions or divestments such that it increases the likelihood of a response through acquisitions while it reduces the likelihood of a response through divestments.

The application of these materials in the industrial scale is hindered by thermodynamic restrictions related to the reoxidation process. This disadvantage can be overcome by doping the oxide with a guest cation. Iron is one of the most promising dopants, but the atomic-level understanding of its effects on the properties of alpha-Mn2O3 is incomplete. Herein, we report a systematic GGA+U study of the bulk properties and reducibility of FexMn2-xO3 (0 <= x <= 2) as a function of Fe dopant concentration. In particular, we focus on a representative set of 20 models with different Fe content, generated by screening several thousand structures. Our results indicate that substitution of Mn atoms with Fe stabilizes FexMn2-xO3, which is visible through negative values of doping energies, decreasing oxide formation energies, and higher oxygen vacancy formation energies with increasing Fe concentration. Similar to Fe, the presence of an oxygen vacancy increases the band gap in the major spin channel of FexMn(2-x)O(3). Oxygen transport in FexMn2-xO3 is found to depend on Fe content and distribution in the lattice. All in all, our findings provide atomic-level insight into the properties of FexMn2-xO3 and generally agree with experimental observations. Obtained information can be applied to investigate the reactivity of FexMn2-xO3. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Beacon node uses heuristic method to solve the model approximately based on virtual force theory and location information of guide sensor nodes, and obtains a moving path which is suitable for the current node distribution.

A subfactor planar para algebra is a Hilbert space representation of planar tangles with parafermionic defects that are invariant under para isotopy. For each Z(N), we construct a family of subfactor planar para algebras that play the role of Temperley-Lieb-Jones planar algebras. The first example in this family is the parafermion planar para algebra (PAPPA). Based on this example, we introduce parafermion Pauli matrices, quaternion relations, and braided relations for parafermion algebras, which one can use in the study of quantum information. An important ingredient in planar para algebra theory is the string Fourier transform (SFT), which we use on the matrix algebra generated by the Pauli matrices. Two different reflections play an important role in the theory of planar para algebras. One is the adjoint operator; the other is the modular conjugation in Tomita-Takesaki theory. We use the latter one to define the double algebra and to introduce reflection positivity.

Using the max flow-min cut principle, a theorem from network theory, we rewrite the RT formula in a way that does not make reference to the minimal surface. Instead, we invoke the notion of a \"flow\", defined as a divergenceless norm-bounded vector field, or equivalently a set of Planck-thickness \"bit threads\". The entanglement entropy of a boundary region is given by the maximum flux out of it of any flow, or equivalently the maximum number of bit threads that can emanate from it. The threads thus represent entanglement between points on the boundary, and naturally implement the holographic principle. As we explain, this new picture clarifies several conceptual puzzles surrounding the RT formula. We give flow-based proofs of strong subadditivity and related properties; unlike the ones based on minimal surfaces, these proofs correspond in a transparent manner to the properties' information-theoretic meanings. We also briefly discuss certain technical advantages that the flows offer over minimal surfaces. In a mathematical appendix, we review the max flow-min cut theorem on networks and on Riemannian manifolds, and prove in the network case that the set of max flows varies Lipshitz continuously in the network parameters.","Authors":"Freedman, M (Freedman, Michael) ; Headrick, M (Headrick, Matthew)","Title":"Bit Threads and Holographic Entanglement"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396952900004 ISSN: 0167-4048 eISSN: 1872-6208","Keywords":"Information security policy; ISP compliance; Psychological contract fulfillment; Rational choice theory; Security education and training awareness; SETA KeyWords Plus:PROTECTION MOTIVATION THEORY; PERCEIVED ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT; DECISION-MAKING; RATIONAL CHOICE; SYSTEMS MISUSE; DETERRENCE; IMPACT; BREACH; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE","Categories":"Computer Science Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Information Systems","Journal Information":"COMPUTERS & SECURITY Volume: 66 Pages: 52-65 DOI: 10.1016/j.cose.2016.12.016 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"Organizations are trying to induce employees to comply with information security policy (ISP) as organizational damage of information breach incidents gets serious.

In this paper, we investigate the main and moderating effect of an employee's status within the organizational hierarchy on an individual's perceived behavioral control related to interactive security threats and controls, specifically tailgating (i.e., the act of gaining access to a restricted area by following someone who has legitimate access). In a survey of Department of Defense employees, we find that the effect of status on perceived behavioral control over tailgating behaviors is positive for employees who report average and above average levels of controllability of coworkers but negative for employees who report below average levels of controllability of coworkers.

In particular we: set out the difference between energy feedback and energy monitoring; define the practice of energy monitoring; and investigate the rationale and qualitative experiences of those performing energy monitoring. An online energy feedback tool ('iMeasure') was the basis of the case study. A netnographic analysis of online discussion about the tool informed complementary in-depth interviews with ten current/former iMeasure users. We found energy monitoring to be a distinct practice that focuses on measuring and identifying energy use trends and requires specific know-how to perform. However, its connections to other household practices were weak and, for those who did perform monitoring, there was no guarantee that this practice would reorganise other practices to induce household energy saving. In fact, monitoring often followed decisions to make energy-related changes, rather than prompting them.

Moreover, for each recommended item, we propose a group that encompasses all the target users' contacts who expressed a positive opinion on it. Our data show that users consider double-sided recommendations more useful than traditional recommendations which provide equivalent information. It was observed that our \"social\" DSR algorithm performs better in the event recommendation domain than a content-based one which has already been recognised as providing a good performance, in terms of precision, recall, accuracy and F1. This result is strengthened by our demonstrating that the good performance DSRs provide also depends on their peculiar structure and not only on the fact that they include \"social\" information. The item-recommendation part also performed better than a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm. Lastly, we found that users' scores for recommended item-group packages can be better predicted by considering only the system scores for the recommended groups, at least in the domain of social and cultural events.","Authors":"Lombardi, I (Lombardi, Ilaria) ; Vernero, F (Vernero, Fabiana)","Title":"What and who with: A social approach to double-sided recommendation"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395809900030 ISSN: 0002-9939 eISSN: 1088-6826","Keywords":"Inner function; Bergman space; Hardy space; Schwarz-Pick lemma; doubling weight; Muckenhoupt weight; maximal function; Carleson measure KeyWords Plus:BLASCHKE PRODUCTS; INTEGRAL MEANS; INEQUALITY","Categories":"Mathematics Web of Science Categories:Mathematics, Applied; Mathematics","Journal Information":"PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY Volume: 145 Issue: 5 Pages: 2155-2166 DOI: 10.1090/proc/13384 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"We characterize those radial doubling weights omega for which the Schwarz-Pick lemma applied to the derivative of any inner function in the norm of the Bergman space A(omega)(p), does not cause any essential loss of information.

To estimate the travel costs for all the touch candidates, our method utilizes a computationally-efficient graph-based path planning method based on stochastic optimal control theory. Simulations with 2D and 3D objects and real-robot experiments with a 7DOF robot arm and a single finger device equipped with a tactile sensor are conducted. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our method for fast tactile object shape estimation as compared to passive exploration and active exploration that touches the most uncertain part of the estimated shape.

Despite its size and central position in China's current poverty reduction strategy, little is known about the rural dibao program's performance and targeting effectiveness. Our analysis uses annual household survey data from the China Household Income Project matched with published administrative data for the years 2007-09. We find that the program provides sufficient income to poor beneficiaries but does not substantially reduce the overall level of poverty. Conventional targeting analysis reveals large inclusionary and exclusionary targeting errors; propensity score targeting analysis yields smaller but still large targeting errors. Simulations of possible changes to the program design reveal that expanding coverage can potentially yield greater poverty reduction than increasing transfer amounts. Replacing locally diverse dibao lines and transfer amounts with a nationally uniform dibao threshold and transfer could in theory reduce poverty further, but the potential gains are modest without improvements in targeting. This paper makes several contributions. To our knowledge this is the first household-level empirical analysis of China's dibao program in rural areas, so the findings provide new, policy-relevant information. Moreover, the literature has not settled the question. of whether such programs should be centralized or decentralized. We show that in practice the potential gains of centralizing the eligibility rule and transfer amount are conditional on the efficiency of targeting. By varying the program's key design parameters our analysis also yields insights into alternative policy recommendations to improve the program performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these approaches can also reinforce social hierarchies and political exclusion if they are not developed and implemented carefully. In particular, participatory approaches can be problematic if they too simplistically conceptualize democratic engagement as the folding of individuals into pre-existing governance structures. Utilizing a combination of feminist and postcolonial theories, this paper argues that practitioners of participatory methods must extend their thinking to the ways in which their projects foster engagement across multiple social and epistemological perspectives. Participatory geographic information systems (PGIS) methodologies are particularly effective at enabling these cross-perspectival engagements-geospatial technologies have unique capabilities for storing and visualizing knowledge from different types of knowledge systems. These different forms of knowledge can not only be visualized as multi-facetted and multi-scalar layers, but they can be directly placed in conversation with one another within the space of the map. In this way, they can be used to fundamentally transform historically unjust governance practices, rather than simply folding new subjects into unjust political structures. The authors examine these claims in the context of a case study with the Maijuna indigenous group of the northeastern Peruvian Amazon. The authors collaborated with the Maijuna to create and use a digital, spatial database to influence policy decisions about land tenure and environmental management. We show that geospatial technologies were uniquely capable of encouraging dialog and integration across indigenous, Western scientific, and state-based perspectives of the Amazon. These technologies are particularly effective at empowering traditionally marginalized perspectives within governance processes. This project therefore offers lessons about the benefits and dangers of geospatial technologies and methodologies for improving the democratic potential of development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Front-end process simulators model the fabrication of devices including different process steps and effects such as ion implantation, dopant and defect diffusion and interaction, epitaxial growth, and stress effects. Continuum process simulators continue to be the main tool; however, kinetic Monte Carlo simulators with and without lattice have become important as well. With the need to explore new materials other than silicon, such as SiGe, germanium, and III-V, more fundamental modeling is required to compensate for missing experimental information. Ab initio methods based on density functional theory and molecular dynamics can help address open questions of material characteristics that cannot be extracted explicitly by experiments. In this paper, we give an overview of a multiscale approach for advanced process modeling and discuss the latest progress.","Authors":"Zographos, N (Zographos, Nikolas) ; Zechner, C (Zechner, Christoph) ; Martin-Bragado, I (Martin-Bragado, Ignacio) ; Lee, K (Lee, Kyuho) ; Oh, YS (Oh, Yong-Seog)","Title":"Multiscale modeling of doping processes in advanced semiconductor devices"}]
