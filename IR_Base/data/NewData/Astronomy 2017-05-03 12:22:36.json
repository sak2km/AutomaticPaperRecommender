Monitoring observations may give a biassed view of the underlying population due to limitations on observing time, visibility and instrumental sensitivity. A similar problem exists in the life sciences, where animal populations (such as migratory birds) or disease prevalence, must be estimated from sparse and incomplete data. The class of methods termed Capture-Recapture is used to reconstruct population estimates from time-series records of encounters with the study population. This paper investigates the performance of Capture-Recapture methods in astronomy via a series of numerical simulations. The Blackbirds code simulates monitoring of populations of transients, in this case accreting binary stars (neutron star or black hole accreting from a stellar companion) under a range of observing strategies. We first generate realistic light-curves for populations of binaries with contrasting orbital period distributions. These models are then randomly sampled at observing cadences typical of existing and planned monitoring surveys. The classical capture-recapture methods, Lincoln-Peterson, Schnabel estimators, related techniques, and newer methods implemented in the Rcapture package are compared. A general exponential model based on the radioactive decay law is introduced which is demonstrated to recover (at 95% confidence) the underlying population abundance and duty cycle, in a fraction of the observing visits (10-50%) required to discover all the sources, in the simulation. Capture-Recapture is a promising addition to the toolbox of time domain astronomy, and, methods implemented in R by the biostats community can be readily called from within python.

Thanks to the e-MERLIN resolution and sensitivity, we resolve for the first time a double structure composed of two radio sources separated by similar to 1 arcsec, previously observed only at higher frequency. We explore this data set, which further includes non-simultaneous data from the Very Large Array, the Gemini telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray observatory, in terms of an outflow-dominated model. We compare our results with previous trends found for other AGN using the same model (NGC 4051, M81*, M87 and Sgr A*), as well as hard-and quiescent-state X-ray binaries.

Of particular importance is how pulsars evolve through the P-P diagram with time. Here we show that the decay of the inclination angle (alpha) between the magnetic and rotation axes plays a critical role. In particular, alpha strongly impacts on the braking torque, an effect that has been largely ignored in previous work. We carry out simulations that include a negative alpha term, and show that it is possible to reproduce the observational P-P diagram without the need for either pulsars with long birth periods or magnetic field decay.

In addition to the films deposited staticly in both systems, we have also deposited films in the LLS801 while shuttling the substrate in front of the target, with the aim of further enhancing the uniformity. Among these three setups, the LLS801 system with substrate shuttling has yielded the highest uniformity in film thickness (+/-2%), effective resistivity (decreasing by 5% fromcenter to edge), and superconducting critical temperature (T-c = 15.0 K-15.3 K) over a empty set 100 mm wafer. However, the shuttling appears to increase the resistivity by almost a factor of 2 compared to static deposition. Surface SEM inspections suggest that the shuttling could have induced a different mode of microstructural film growth.","Authors":"Thoen, DJ (Thoen, David Johannes) ; Bos, BGC (Bos, Boy Gustaaf Cornelis) ; Haalebos, EAF (Haalebos, E.

However, conventional electrical spectrum analyzer (ESA) has limited operation speed and observation bandwidth due to the electronic bottleneck. Therefore, a variety of photonics-assisted methods have been extensively explored due to the bandwidth advantage of the optical domain. Alternatively, we proposed and experimentally demonstrated an ultrafast ESA based on all-optical Fourier transform and temporal magnification in this paper. The radio-frequency (RF) signal under test is temporally multiplexed to the spectrum of an ultrashort pulse, thus the frequency information is converted to the time axis. Moreover, since the bandwidth of this ultrashort pulse is far beyond that of the state-of-the-art photo-detector, a temporal magnification system is applied to stretch the time axis, and capture the RF spectrum with 1-GHz resolution. The observation bandwidth of this ultrafast ESA is over 20 GHz, limited by that of the electro-optic modulator. Since all the signal processing is in the optical domain, the acquisition frame rate can be as high as 50 MHz. This ultrafast ESA scheme can be further improved with better dispersive engineering, and is promising for some ultrafast spectral information acquisition applications.

Various gamma-ray burst (GRB) detectors, and more notably the ground-based gravitational wave detectors, typically have large uncertainties in the sky positions of detected sources. Searching these large sky regions spanning hundreds of square degrees is a formidable challenge for most ground-based optical telescopes, which can usually image less than tens of square degrees of the sky in a single night. We present algorithms for better scheduling of such follow-up observations in order to maximize the probability of imaging the optical counterpart, based on the all-sky probability distribution of the source position. We incorporate realistic observing constraints such as the diurnal cycle, telescope pointing limitations, available observing time, and the rising/setting of the target at the observatory's location. We use simulations to demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform the default greedy observing schedule used by many observatories. Our algorithms are applicable for follow-up of other transient sources with large positional uncertainties, such as Fermi-detected GRBs, and can easily be adapted for scheduling radio or space-based X-ray follow-up.","Authors":"Rana, J (Rana, Javed) ; Singhal, A (Singhal, Akshat) ; Gadre, B (Gadre, Bhooshan) ; Bhalerao, V (Bhalerao, Varun) ; Bose, S (Bose, Sukanta)","Title":"An Enhanced Method for Scheduling Observations of Large Sky Error Regions for Finding Optical Counterparts to Transients"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398491100005 ISSN: 0922-6435 eISSN: 1572-9508","Keywords":"FX correlator; Radio astronomy; CMAC; ASIC","Categories":"Astronomy & Astrophysics Web of Science Categories:Astronomy & Astrophysics","Journal Information":"EXPERIMENTAL ASTRONOMY Volume: 43 Issue: 2 Pages: 177-187 DOI: 10.1007/s10686-017-9527-4 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"This paper presents the approach of using complex multiplier-accumulators (CMACs) with multiple accumulators to reduce the total number of memory operations in an input-buffered architecture for the X part of an FX correlator. A processing unit of this architecture uses an array of CMACs that are reused for different groups of baselines. The disadvantage of processing correlations in this way is that each input data sample has to be read multiple times from the memory because each input signal is used in many of these baseline groups. While a one-accumulator CMAC cannot switch to a different baseline until it is finished integrating the current one, a multiple-accumulator CMAC can. Thus, the array of multiple-accumulator CMACs can switch between processing different baselines that share some input signals at any moment to reuse the current data in the processing buffers. In this way significant reductions in the number of memory read operations are achieved with only a few accumulators per CMAC. For example, for a large number of input signals three-accumulator CMACs reduce the total number of memory operations by more than a third. Simulated energy measurements of four VLSI designs in a high-performance 28 nm CMOS technology are presented in this paper to demonstrate that using multiple accumulators can also lead to reduced power dissipation of the processing array.

We quantify the detection significance and measurement uncertainties in the fitted parameters, and we derive weighted versions of the RM synthesis algorithm which, under certain conditions, maximize the likelihood. We use Monte Carlo simulations to compare injected and recovered source parameters for a range of signal-to-noise ratios, investigate the quality of standard methods for estimating measurement uncertainties and search for statistical biases. These simulations consider one frequency band each for the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and the Low Frequency Array. We find that results obtained for one frequency band cannot be easily generalized, and that methods that were developed in the past for correcting bias in individual frequency channels do not apply to wide-band data sets. The standard method for estimating the measurement uncertainty in RM is not accurate for sources with non-zero spectral indices. Furthermore, dividing Stokes Q and U by Stokes I to correct for spectral index effects, in combination with RM synthesis, does not maximize the likelihood.","Authors":"Schnitzeler, DHFM (Schnitzeler, D.

The Balloon-borne Imaging Testbed (BIT) is an instrument designed to meet the technological requirements of high-precision astronomical missions, and is a precursor to the development of a facility-class instrument with capabilities similar to the Hubble Space Telescope. The attitude determination and control systems (ADCS) for BIT, the design, implementation, and analysis of which are the focus of this paper, compensate for compound pendulation effects and other sub-orbital disturbances in the stratosphere to within 1-200 (rms), while back-end optics provide further image stabilization down to 0.0500 (not discussed here). During the inaugural test flight from Timmins, Canada in September 2015, BIT ADCS pointing and stabilization performed exceptionally, with coarse pointing and target acquisition to within <0.1 degrees and fine stabilization to 0.6800 (rms) over long (10-30 min) integrations. This level of performance was maintained during flight for several tracking runs that demonstrated pointing stability on the sky for more than an hour at a time. To refurbish and improve the system for the three-month flight from New Zealand in 2018, certain modifications to the ADCS need to be made to smooth pointing mode transitions and to correct for internal biases observed during the test flight. Furthermore, the level of autonomy must be increased for future missions to improve system reliability and robustness.","Authors":"Romualdez, LJ (Romualdez, L.

Optical survey is the main technique for observing space debris, which contributes much to the studies of space environment. However, due to the motion of registered objects, image degradation is critical in optical space debris observations, as it affects the efficiency of data reduction and lowers the precision of astrometry. Therefore, the image restoration in the form of deconvolution can be applied to improve the data quality and reduction accuracy. To promote the image processing and optimize the reduction, the image degradation across the field of view is modeled statistically with principal component analysis and the efficient mean point-spread function (PSF) is derived from raw images, which is further used in the image restoration. To test the efficiency and reliability, trial observations were made for both low-Earth orbital and high-Earth orbital objects. The positions of all targets were measured using our novel approach and compared with the reference positions. The performance of image restoration employing our estimated PSF was compared with several competitive approaches. The proposed image restoration outperformed the others so that the influence of image degradation was distinctly reduced, which resulted in a higher signal-to-noise ratio and more precise astrometric measurements.","Authors":"Sun, RY (Sun, Rongyu) ; Jia, P (Jia, Peng)","Title":"Image Restoration Based on Statistic PSF Modeling for Improving the Astrometry of Space Debris"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Review Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395373100002 ISSN: 0218-2718 eISSN: 1793-6594","Keywords":"Astronomy; astrophysics; public outreach; image-making; visualization; color theory; art KeyWords Plus:CRAB-NEBULA; GALAXIES; IMAGE","Categories":"Astronomy & Astrophysics Web of Science Categories:Astronomy & Astrophysics","Journal Information":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D Volume: 26 Issue: 4 Article Number: 1730010 DOI: 10.1142/S0218271817300105 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Bold color images from telescopes act as extraordinary ambassadors for research astronomers because they pique the public's curiosity.

We combine the guided mode theory in geometric optics and a well-known model, the power distribution model (PDM), to predict and explain the FRD dependence properties. We present a robust method by modifying the energy distribution method with f-intercept to control the input condition. This method provides away to determine the proper position of the fibre end on the focal plane to improve energy utilization and FRD performance, which lifts the relative throughput up to 95 per cent with variation of output focal ratio less than 2 per cent. This method can also help to optimize the arrangement of the position of focal-plane plate to enhance the coupling efficiency in a telescope. To investigate length properties, we modified the PDM by introducing a new parameter, the focal distance f, into the original model to make it available for a multiposition measurement system. The results show that the modified model is robust and feasible for measuring the key parameter d(0) to simulate the transmission characteristics. The output focal ratio in the experiment does not follow the prediction trend but shows an interesting phenomenon: the output focal ratio increases first to the peak, then decreases and remains stable finally with increasing fibre length longer than 15 m. This provides a reference for choosing the appropriate length of fibre to improve the FRD performance for the design of the fibre system in a telescope.","Authors":"Yan, YX (Yan, Yunxiang) ; Wang, G (Wang, Gang) ; Sun, WM (Sun, Weimin) ; Luo, AL (Luo, A-Li) ; Ma, ZY (Ma, Zhenyu) ; Li, J (Li, Jian) ; Wang, SQ (Wang, Shuqing)","Title":"A modified method for determining the focal ratio degradation and length properties of optical fibres in astronomy"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398181000006 ISSN: 0067-0049 eISSN: 1538-4365","Keywords":"Galaxy: structure; ISM: clouds; ISM: molecules KeyWords Plus:MILKY-WAY; SPIRAL ARMS; CO SURVEY; INTERSTELLAR EXTINCTION; RADIO ASTRONOMY; CARBON-MONOXIDE; OUTER GALAXY; STELLAR DISK; WARP; GAS","Categories":"Astronomy & Astrophysics Web of Science Categories:Astronomy & Astrophysics","Journal Information":"ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES Volume: 229 Issue: 2 Article Number: 24 DOI: 10.3847/1538-4365/aa5d9d Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Using the Purple Mountain Observatory Delingha (PMODLH) 13.7m telescope, we report a 96 deg(2) (CO)-C-12/(CO)-C-13/(CO)-O-18 mapping observation toward the Galactic region of l = [139 degrees. 75,149 degrees. 75], b = [-5 degrees. 25, 5 degrees. 25].

Spectral scans in two grisms covered the broad S(0) and S(1) absorption lines, in addition to contextual imaging in eight broad-band filters (5-37 mu m) with spatial resolutions of 2-4\". The spectra were inverted to map the zonal-mean temperature and para-H-2 distribution (f(p), the fraction of the para spin isomer with respect to the ortho spin isomer) in Jupiter's upper troposphere (the 100700 mbar range). We compared these to a reanalysis of Voyager-1 and -2 IRIS spectra covering the same spectral range. Tropospheric temperature contrasts match those identified by Voyager in 1979, within the limits of temporal variability consistent with previous investigations. Para-H-2 increases from equator to pole, with low fp air at the equator representing sub-equilibrium conditions (i.e., less para-H-2 than expected from thermal equilibration), and high fp air and possible super-equilibrium at higher latitudes. In particular, we confirm the continued presence of a region of high f(p) air at high northern latitudes discovered by Voyager/IRIS, and an asymmetry with generally higher f(p) in the north than in the south. Far-IR aerosol opacity is not required to fit the data, but cannot be completely ruled out. We note that existing collision-induced absorption databases lack opacity from (H-2)(2) dimers, leading to under-prediction of the absorption near the S(0) and S(1) peaks. There appears to be no spatial correlation between para-H-2 and tropospheric ammonia, phosphine and cloud opacity derived from Voyager/IRIS at mid-infrared wavelengths (7-15 mu m). We note, however, that para-H-2 tracks the similar latitudinal distribution of aerosols within Jupiter's upper tropospheric and stratospheric hazes observed in reflected sunlight, suggesting that catalysis of hydrogen equilibration within the hazes (and not the main clouds) may govern the equator to-pole gradient, with conditions closer to equilibrium at higher latitudes. This gradient is superimposed onto smaller-scale variations associated with regional advection of para-H-2 at the equator and poles. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Numerical relativity simulations play a central role in the study of these events. In particular, given the importance ofmagnetic fields, various aspects of this investigation require general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). So far, most GRMHD simulations focused the attention on BNS mergers leading to the formation of a hypermassive neutron star (NS), which, in turn, collapseswithin fewtens of ms into a black hole surrounded by an accretion disk. However, recent observations suggest that a significant fraction of these systems could form a long-lived NS remnant, which will either collapse on much longer time scales or remain indefinitely stable. Despite the profound implications for the evolution and the emission properties of the system, a detailed investigation of this alternative evolution channel is still missing. Here, we follow this direction and present a first detailed GRMHD study of BNS mergers forming a long-lived NS. We considermagnetized binarieswith different mass ratios and equations of state and analyze the structure of the NS remnants, the rotation profiles, the accretion disks, the evolution and amplification of magnetic fields, and the ejection of matter.

We simulate signals in a hypothetical future experiment based on the Axion Dark Matter Experiment that could be performed once the axion has been detected and a frequency range containing the axion mass has been identified. We develop a statistical analysis to extract astrophysical parameters, such as the halo velocity dispersion and laboratory velocity, from such data and find that with only a few days integration time a level of precision can be reached, matching that of astronomical observations. For longer experiments lasting up to a year in duration, we find that exploiting the modulation of the power spectrum in time allows accurate measurements of the Solar peculiar velocity with an accuracy that would improve upon astronomical observations. We also simulate signals based on results from N-body simulations and find that finer substructure in the form of tidal streams would show up prominently in future data, even if only a subdominant contribution to the local dark matter distribution. In these cases, it would be possible to reconstruct all the properties of a dark matter stream using the time and frequency dependence of the signal. Finally, we consider the detection prospects for a network of streams from tidally disrupted axion miniclusters. These features appear much more prominently in the resolved spectrum than suggested by calculations based on a scan over a range of resonant frequencies, making the detection of axion minicluster streams more viable than previously thought.

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is achieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from non-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to a variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate the data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are transient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so that accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible. Glitches come in a wide range of time-frequency-amplitude morphologies, with new morphologies appearing as the detector evolves. Since they can obscure or mimic true gravitational-wave signals, a robust characterization of glitches is paramount in the effort to achieve the gravitational-wave detection rates that are predicted by the design sensitivity of LIGO. This proves a daunting task for members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration alone due to the sheer amount of data. In this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing with machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the glitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we engage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of time-frequency representations of glitches into preidentified morphological classes and to discover new classes that appear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are used to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of the morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification methods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency and accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and characterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and subsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby improving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We demonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO's first observing run.","Authors":"Zevin, M (Zevin, M.) ; Coughlin, S (Coughlin, S.) ; Bahaadini, S (Bahaadini, S.) ; Besler, E (Besler, E.) ; Rohani, N (Rohani, N.) ; Allen, S (Allen, S.) ; Cabero, M (Cabero, M.) ; Crowston, K (Crowston, K.) ; Katsaggelos, AK (Katsaggelos, A.

These ionospheric perturbations are observed in the relative change of the total electron content (Delta TEC/Delta t) measurements from the coherent ionospheric Doppler radar (CIDR). The CIDR system makes high-precision measurements of the total electron content (TEC) change along raypaths from ground receivers to low Earth-orbiting (LEO) beacon spacecraft. These measurements can be integrated along the orbital track of the beacon satellite to construct the relative spatial, not temporal, TEC profiles that are useful for determining the large-scale plasma distribution. The observed spatial TEC changes reveal many interesting features of the magnetar signatures in the ionosphere. The onset phase of the magnetar flare was during the CIDR's nighttime satellite passage. The nighttime small-scale perturbations detected by CIDR, with Delta TEC/Delta t >= 0.05 TECU s(-1), over the eastern Mediterranean on 22 January 2009 were synchronized with the onset phase of the magnetar flare and consistent with the emission of hundreds of bursts detected from the source. The maximum daytime large-scale perturbation measured by CIDR over northern Africa and the eastern Mediterranean was detected after similar to 6h from the main phase of the magnetar flare, with Delta TEC/Delta t <= 0.10 TECU s(-1). These ionospheric perturbations resembled an unusual poleward traveling ionospheric disturbance (TID) caused by the extraterrestrial source. The TID's estimated virtual velocity is 385.8 ms(-1), with Delta TEC/Delta t <= 0.10 TECU s(-1).","Authors":"Mahrous, A (Mahrous, Ayman)","Title":"Ionospheric response to magnetar flare: signature of SGR J1550-5418 on coherent ionospheric Doppler radar"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396031400001 ISSN: 2470-0010 eISSN: 2470-0029","Categories":"Astronomy & Astrophysics; Physics Web of Science Categories:Astronomy & Astrophysics; Physics, Particles & Fields","Journal Information":"PHYSICAL REVIEW D Volume: 95 Issue: 6 Article Number: 062001 DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.95.062001 Published: MAR 6 2017","Abstract":"With the recent detection of gravitational waves (GWs), marking the start of the new field of GW astronomy, the push for building more sensitive laser-interferometric gravitational wave detectors (GWDs) has never been stronger. Balanced homodyne detection (BHD) allows for a quantum-noise (QN) limited readout of arbitrary light field quadratures, and has therefore been suggested as a vital building block for upgrades to Advanced LIGO and third-generation observatories. In terms of the practical implementation of BHD, we develop a full framework for analyzing the static optical high-order modes (HOMs) occurring in the BHD paths related to the misalignment or mode matching at the input and output ports of the laser interferometer. We find the effects of HOMs on the quantum-noise limited sensitivity is independent of the actual interferometer configuration; e.g. Michelson and Sagnac interferometers are affected in the same way. We show that misalignment of the output ports of the interferometer (output misalignment) only affects the high-frequency part of the quantum-noise limited sensitivity (detection noise). However, at low frequencies, HOMs reduce the interferometer response and the radiation pressure noise (back-action noise) by the same amount and hence the quantum-noise limited sensitivity is not negatively affected in that frequency range. We show that the misalignment of the laser into the interferometer (input misalignment) produces the same effect as output misalignment and additionally decreases the power inside the interferometer. We also analyze dynamic HOM effects, such as beam jitter created by the suspended mirrors of the BHD. Our analyses can be directly applied to any BHD implementation in a future GWD. Moreover, we apply our analytical techniques to the example of the speed meter proof-of-concept experiment under construction in Glasgow. We find that for our experimental parameters, the performance of our seismic isolation system in the BHD paths is compatible with the design sensitivity of the experiment.","Authors":"Zhang, T (Zhang, Teng) ; Danilishin, SL (Danilishin, Stefan L.) ; Steinlechner, S (Steinlechner, Sebastian) ; Barr, BW (Barr, Bryan W.) ; Bell, AS (Bell, Angus S.) ; Dupej, P (Dupej, Peter) ; Graf, C (Graf, Christian) ; Hennig, JS (Hennig, Jan-Simon) ; Houston, EA (Houston, E.

In X-ray region, however, the outermost ring width of Fresnel zone plate is limited by processing technology. Such a limitation makes it impossible to fabricate a sufficiently small zone plate, thus restricting the applications of Fresnel zone plate coded imaging. In this paper, we present a new reconstruction method of zone plate coded imaging by using a higher-order order Gabor zone plate. With the proposed method, higher spatial resolution can be achieved than with the regular methods, thus the spatial resolution is improved by 1/m times the width of outermost ring (where m is a positive integer).

Blind surveys with new wide-field radio instruments are setting increasingly stringent limits on the transient surface density on various timescales. Although many of these instruments are limited by classical confusion noise from an ensemble of faint, unresolved sources, one can in principle detect transients below the classical confusion limit to the extent that the classical confusion noise is independent of time. We develop a technique for detecting radio transients that is based on temporal matched filters applied directly to time series of images, rather than relying on source-finding algorithms applied to individual images. This technique has well-defined statistical properties and is applicable to variable and transient searches for both confusion-limited and non-confusion-limited instruments. Using the Murchison Widefield Array as an example, we demonstrate that the technique works well on real data despite the presence of classical confusion noise, sidelobe confusion noise, and other systematic errors. We searched for transients lasting between 2 minutes and 3 months. We found no transients and set improved upper limits on the transient surface density at 182 MHz for flux densities between similar to 20 and 200 mJy, providing the best limits to date for hour-and month-long transients.","Authors":"Feng, L (Feng, L.) ; Vaulin, R (Vaulin, R.) ; Hewitt, JN (Hewitt, J.

Heterodyne mixers are commonly used for high-resolution spectroscopy at radio telescopes. When used as a double sideband system, the accurate flux calibration of spectral lines acquired by those detectors is highly dependent on the system gains in the respective mixer sidebands via the so-called sideband gain ratio (SBR). As such, the SBR was one of the main contributors to the calibration uncertainty budget of the Herschel/HIFI instrument. Aims. We want to determine the HIFI instrument sideband gain ratio for all bands on a fine frequency grid and within an accuracy of a few percent. Methods. We introduce a novel technique involving in-orbit HIFI data that is bootstrapped onto standard methods involving laboratory data measurements of the SBR. We deconvolved the astronomical data to provide a proxy of the expected signal at every frequency channel, and extracted the sideband gain ratios from the residuals of that process. Results. We determine the HIFI sideband gain ratio to an accuracy varying between 1 and 4%, with degraded accuracy in higher frequency ranges, and at places where the reliability of the technique is lower. These figures were incorporated into the HIFI data processing pipeline and improved the overall flux uncertainty of the legacy data from this instrument. Conclusions. We demonstrate that a modified sideband deconvolution algorithm, using astronomical data in combination with gas cell measurements, can be used to generate an accurate and fine-granularity picture of the sideband gain ratio behaviour of a heterodyne receiver.","Authors":"Kester, D (Kester, Do) ; Higgins, R (Higgins, Ronan) ; Teyssier, D (Teyssier, David)","Title":"Derivation of sideband gain ratio for Herschel/HIFI"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395821900051 ISSN: 1432-0746","Keywords":"methods: data analysis; surveys; novae, cataclysmic variables; galaxies: individual: M31 KeyWords Plus:DIFFERENCE IMAGE PHOTOMETRY; STELLAR PHOTOMETRY; SUBTRACTION; SPACE","Categories":"Astronomy & Astrophysics Web of Science Categories:Astronomy & Astrophysics","Journal Information":"ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS Volume: 599 Article Number: A48 DOI: 10.1051/0004-6361/201629368 Published: MAR 2017","Abstract":"Context. In the present era of large-scale surveys in the time domain, the processing of data, from procurement up to the detection of sources, is generally automated. One of the main challenges in the astrophysical analysis of their output is contamination by artifacts, especially in the regions of high surface brightness of unresolved emission. Aims. We present a novel method for identifying candidates for variable and transient sources from the outputs of optical time-domain survey data pipelines. We use the method to conduct a systematic search for novae in the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) observations of the bulge part of M31 during the second half of 2013. Methods. We demonstrate that a significant fraction of artifacts produced by the iPTF pipeline form a locally uniform background of false detections approximately obeying Poissonian statistics, whereas genuine variable and transient sources, as well as artifacts associated with bright stars, result in clusters of detections whose spread is determined by the source localization accuracy. This makes the problem analogous to source detection on images produced by grazing incidence X-ray telescopes, enabling one to utilize the arsenal of powerful tools developed in X-ray astronomy. In particular, we use a wavelet-based source detection algorithm from the Chandra data analysis package CIAO. Results. Starting from similar to 2 : 5 x 10(5) raw detections made by the iPTF data pipeline, we obtain approximately 4000 unique source candidates. Cross-matching these candidates with the source-catalog of a deep reference image of the same field, we find counterparts for similar to 90% of the candidates. These sources are either artifacts due to imperfect PSF matching or genuine variable sources. The remaining approximately 400 detections are transient sources. We identify novae among these candidates by applying selection cuts to their lightcurves based on the expected properties of novae. Thus, we recovered all 12 known novae ( not counting one that erupted toward the end of the survey) registered during the time span of the survey and discovered three nova candidates. Our method is generic and can be applied to mining any target out of the artifacts in optical time-domain data. As it is fully automated, its incompleteness can be accurately computed and corrected for.","Authors":"Soraisam, MD (Soraisam, Monika D.) ; Gilfanov, M (Gilfanov, Marat) ; Kupfer, T (Kupfer, Thomas) ; Masci, F (Masci, Frank) ; Shafter, AW (Shafter, Allen W.) ; Prince, TA (Prince, Thomas A.) ; Kulkarni, SR (Kulkarni, Shrinivas R.) ; Ofek, EO (Ofek, Eran O.) ; Bellm, E (Bellm, Eric)","Title":"A novel method for transient detection in high-cadence optical surveys Its application for a systematic search for novae in M31"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397919500005 ISSN: 1932-4553 eISSN: 1941-0484","Keywords":"Antenna array; radio astronomy; sidelobe blanking; time modulated array KeyWords Plus:LINEAR ARRAYS; SIDELOBE BLANKING; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; ANTENNA-ARRAYS; PASSIVE RADAR; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEMS; SUPPRESSION; PERFORMANCE; SCENARIOS","Categories":"Engineering Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Journal Information":"IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING Volume: 11 Issue: 2 Pages: 271-281 DOI: 10.1109/JSTSP.2016.2615268 Published: MAR 2017","Abstract":"This paper presents experimental results using time modulation to implement inexpensive sidelobe blanking.

Autocentering techniques have been used for instruments at room temperature with relatively relaxed image quality requirements. We present in detail its application to a mount for a cryogenic instrument working at the diffraction limit. The design has been tested on the collimator of FRIDA, a noncemented doublet of CaF2 and S-FTM16. We describe the alignment requirements of the system, and we show the calculations that ensure that the lenses will suffer both appropriate stresses and temperature differences.

Working with high diffraction orders and big diffraction angle, which has the advantages of high resolution and full wave shining. It has been widely used in high-end spectrum instrument, which greatly promoted the development of aerospace, astronomy, medical, military, environment and other cutting-edge technology. However, professional scoring system needs to be customized, and the price is very expensive. The use of sophisticated ultra precision machining equipment to process in the ladder grating can greatly reduce the preparation cost of the mother plate of the ladder grating. Due to the bad straightness and high accumulative error of ultra precision single point diamond lathe, it can' t satisfy the demand of preparation when preparing the echelle grating, casuing the bad diffraction wave front. In order to reduce the straightness error, this paper comes up with the error compensation for the single point diamond lathe. Firstly, we make the first compensation based on the accumulative error curve. When the compensation ratio is 0.75 to 0.85, the peak valley value (pv) of the diffraction wave front is about 400 nm, reaching its greatest effect of the first straightness compensation. Secondly, we make the straightness compensation according to the diffraction wave front curve of the blazed order. The pv of the diffraction wave front is about 83nm. The results show that the diffraction wave front is greatly improved which is beneficial to improve the quality of the grating, and has a guiding role in the actual grating characterization.","Authors":"Huang, YS (Huang Yuan-shen) ; Dong, CC (Dong Cheng-cheng) ; Huang, YB (Huang Yun-bai) ; Sheng, B (Sheng Bin) ; Zhou, HY (Zhou Hong-yan) ; Sun, L (Sun Le) ; Yang, HM (Yang Hai-ma) ; Zhang, DW (Zhang Da-wei)","Title":"Research on Straightness Error Compensation of Grating Ruling Machine"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397418000010 ISSN: 0591-2385 eISSN: 1467-9744","Keywords":"astronomy; divine action; divine creation; embodied cognition; participatory perceptions; physicalism; universe KeyWords Plus:GODS ACTION; WORLD","Categories":"Social Issues; Religion Web of Science Categories:Social Issues; Religion","Journal Information":"ZYGON Volume: 52 Issue: 1 Pages: 186-195 DOI: 10.1111/zygo.12320 Published: MAR 2017","Abstract":"I explore how the notion of divine creation could be made understandable in a worldview dominated by empirical science. The crucial question concerns the empirical basis of belief in creation. Astronomical observations have changed our worldview in an exemplary manner. I show by an example from imaginative literature that human beings can perceive stars by means other than astronomical observation. This alternative mode may be described as \"participatory perception,\" in which a human experiences the world not by objectifying separation as in science, but by personal involvement. I relate such perceptions to \"embodied cognitive science,\" a topical interdisciplinary field of research in philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. Embodied cognitions initiate processes that can convey personal experiences of the stars. Such cognitions may involve religious apprehensions and give rise to sophisticated values. It is argued that the knowledge available through astrophysics and interpretation of the universe as divine creation represent two different ways of perceiving the same reality and should thus be seen as mutually complementary.","Authors":"Benz, AO (Benz, Arnold O.)","Title":"ASTROPHYSICS AND CREATION: PERCEIVING THE UNIVERSE THROUGH SCIENCE AND PARTICIPATION"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395165900078 ISSN: 0035-8711 eISSN: 1365-2966","Keywords":"instrumentation; interferometers - techniques; interferometric - telescopes.

To achieve the expected level of sensitivity for SKA-LOW, it is particularly important to understand how interfering sources in both near and far side- lobes of the station beam affect the imaging performance. In this study, we discuss options for station designs, and adopting a random element layout, we assess its effectiveness by investigating how sources far from the main lobe of the station beam degrade images of the target field. These sources have the effect of introducing a noise-like corruption to images, which is called the far sidelobe confusion noise (FSCN). Using OSKAR, a software simulator accelerated using graphics processing units, we carried out end-to-end simulations using an all-sky model and telescope configuration representative of the SKA- LOW instrument. The FSCN is a function of both the station beam and the interferometric point spread function, and decreases with increasing observation time until the coverage of the aperture plane no longer improves. Using apodizationto reduce the level of near-in sidelobes of the station beam had a notable improvement on the level of the FSCN at low frequencies. Our results indicate that the effects of picking up sources in the sidelobes are worse at low frequencies, where the array is less sparse.","Authors":"Mort, B (Mort, Benjamin) ; Dulwich, F (Dulwich, Fred) ; Razavi-Ghods, N (Razavi-Ghods, Nima) ; Acedo, ED (Acedo, Eloy de Lera) ; Grainge, K (Grainge, Keith)","Title":"Analysing the impact of far-out sidelobes on the imaging performance of the SKA-LOW telescope"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395645600008 ISSN: 0002-9505 eISSN: 1943-2909","Categories":"Education & Educational Research; Physics Web of Science Categories:Education, Scientific Disciplines; Physics, Multidisciplinary","Journal Information":"AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS Volume: 85 Issue: 3 Pages: 207-215 DOI: 10.1119/1.4967847 Published: MAR 2017","Abstract":"We have investigated the practicability of Aristarchus' method of determining the Sun's and the Moon's sizes and distances from Earth using a simple 8-in. telescope and a digital camera.

The light microscope, long a mainstay of the experimental biologist, is now used for a wide array of biological experimental scenarios and sample types. Much of the great developments in advanced biological imaging have been driven by the digital imaging revolution with powerful processors and algorithms. In particular, this combination of advanced imaging and computational analysis has resulted in the drive of the modern biologist to not only visually inspect dynamic phenomena, but to quantify the involved processes. This need to quantitate images has become a major thrust within the bioimaging community and requires extensible and accessible image processing routines with corresponding intuitive software packages. Novel algorithms both made specifically for light microscopy or adapted from other fields, such as astronomy, are available to biologists, but often in a form that is inaccessible for a number of reasons ranging from data input issues, usability and training concerns, and accessibility and output limitations. The biological community has responded to this need by developing open source software packages that are freely available and provide access to image processing routines. One of the most prominent is the open-source image package ImageJ. In this review, we give an overview of prominent imaging processing approaches in ImageJ that we think are of particular interest for biological imaging and that illustrate the functionality of ImageJ and other open source image analysis software.

(17) from the paper of Li & Ma (1983) to discrete on-and off-source regions. The on-source region is typically a circular area with radius theta in which the signal is expected to appear with the shape of the instrument point spread function (PSF). This paper addresses the question of what is the that maximises the probability of detection for a given PSF width and background event density. In the high count number limit and assuming a Gaussian PSF profile, the optimum is found to be at zeta(2)(infinity) approximate to 2.51 times the squared PSF width sigma(2)(PSF39). While this number is shown to be a good choice in many cases, a dynamic formula for cases of lower count numbers, which favour larger on-source regions, is given. The recipe to get to this parametrisation can also be applied to cases with a non-Gaussian PSF. This result can standardise and simplify analysis procedures, reduce trials and eliminate the need for experience-based ad hoc cut definitions or expensive case-by-case Monte Carlo simulations.

In this paper, we propose higher order tensor methods to solve the blind spatial signature estimation problem using planar arrays. By assuming that sources' powers vary between successive time blocks, we recast the spatial and spatiotemporal covariance models for the received data as third-order PARATUCK2 and fourth-order Tucker4 tensor decompositions, respectively. Firstly, by exploiting the multilinear algebraic structure of the proposed tensor models, new iterative algorithms are formulated to blindly estimate the spatial signatures. Secondly, in order to achieve a better spatial resolution, we propose an expanded form of spatial smoothing that returns extra spatial dimensions in comparison with the traditional approaches. Additionally, by exploiting the higher-order structure of the resulting expanded tensor model, a multilinear noise reduction preprocessing step is proposed via higher-order singular value decomposition. We show that the increase on the tensor order provides a more efficient denoising, and consequently a better performance compared to existing spatial smoothing techniques. Finally, a solution based on a multi-stage Khatri-Rao factorization procedure is incorporated as the final stage of our proposed estimators. Our results demonstrate that the proposed tensor methods yield more accurate spatial signature estimates than competing approaches while operating in a challenging scenario where the source covariance structure is unknown and arbitrary (non-diagonal), which is actually the case when sample covariances are computed from a limited number of snapshots.

Comparison of photoresponse of the detectors under alternate operating mode and conventional operation mode (COM) is made. We demonstrate that the detectors can achieve high responsivity through positive bias on the active layer side, namely, alternate operating mode (AOM). The response of the detectors terminates at wavelength of 35 mu m (8.57 THz) under AOM; on the contrary, the response is cutoff at 31 mu m (9.68 THz) with a positive bias on the blocking layer, namely, COM. The relative responsivity at 0.6 V under AOM is 2.3 times of that under COM. By developing an energy band model, we find that the response difference under the two modes originates from the change of band offsets. The electric field in the blocking layer under AOM is much smaller than COM and most of the voltage drops in the active layer under AOM, which leads to the bigger multiplication of the photon-generated carriers than COM. By analyzing the origination of the dark current under the AOM, a method to improve the performance of BIB detectors under AOM is proposed.","Authors":"Zhu, H (Zhu, He) ; Weng, ZP (Weng, Zeping) ; Zhu, JQ (Zhu, Jiaqi) ; Wu, HZ (Wu, Huizhen) ; Li, N (Li, Ning) ; Dai, N (Dai, Ning)","Title":"Comparison of Photoresponse of Si-Based BIB THz Detectors"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396388900007 ISSN: 2156-342X","Keywords":"IV-VI semiconductor materials; terahertz KeyWords Plus:TELLURIDE-BASED PHOTODETECTORS; SEMICONDUCTORS; PHOTOCONDUCTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; IMPURITIES; RADIATION; STATES; FIELD","Categories":"Engineering; Optics; Physics Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Optics; Physics, Applied","Journal Information":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON TERAHERTZ SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY Volume: 7 Issue: 2 Pages: 172-176 DOI: 10.1109/TTHZ.2017.2655880 Published: MAR 2017","Abstract":"We present results of an experimental study concentrated on performance optimization of highly sensitive Pb1-xSnxTe(In) terahertz photodetectors perspective for applications in the terahertz astronomy.

Frequently dismissed as pseudoscience by astronomers, these stories continue to draw the attention of the public by provoking mass media coverage. Targeted at junior undergraduate levels, this activity allows students to debunk some of the myths surrounding Planet X by using simulation software to demonstrate that such a large-mass planet with extreme eccentricity would be unable to enter our Solar System unnoticed, let alone maintain a stable orbit.","Authors":"Cowley, M (Cowley, Michael) ; Hughes, S (Hughes, Stephen) Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number Cowley, Michael  http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4653-8637","Title":"Modelling the dynamics of a hypothetical Planet X by way of gravitational N-body simulator"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000394653800001 PubMed ID: 28232720 ISSN: 2041-1723","Categories":"Science & Technology - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:Multidisciplinary Sciences","Journal Information":"NATURE COMMUNICATIONS Volume: 8 Article Number: 14569 DOI: 10.1038/ncomms14569 Published: FEB 24 2017","Abstract":"The generation of temporal cavity solitons in microresonators results in coherent low-noise optical frequency combs that are critical for applications in spectroscopy, astronomy, navigation or telecommunications.

To date, the dynamics of breather solitons in microresonators remains largely unexplored, and its experimental characterization is challenging. Here we demonstrate the excitation of breather solitons in two different microresonator platforms based on silicon nitride and on silicon. We investigate the dependence of the breathing frequency on pump detuning and observe the transition from period-1 to period-2 oscillation.

Recently, three Earth-sized planets were detected that transit (that is, pass in front of) a star with a mass just eight per cent that of the Sun, located 12 parsecs away(1). The transiting configuration of these planets, combined with the Jupiter-like size of their host star-named TRAPPIST-1-makes possible in-depth studies of their atmospheric properties with present-day and future astronomical facilities(1-3). Here we report the results of a photometric monitoring campaign of that star from the ground and space. Our observations reveal that at least seven planets with sizes and masses similar to those of Earth revolve around TRAPPIST-1. The six inner planets form a near-resonant chain, such that their orbital periods (1.51, 2.42, 4.04, 6.06, 9.1 and 12.35 days) are near-ratios of small integers. This architecture suggests that the planets formed farther from the star and migrated inwards(4,5).

In this paper, we propose a new configuration of solar MCAO based on high order ground layer adaptive optics and low order high altitude correction, which result in a homogeneous correction effect in the whole field of view. An individual high order multiple direction Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor is employed in the configuration to detect the ground layer turbulence for low altitude correction. Furthermore, the other low order multiple direction Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor supplies the wavefront information caused by high layers' turbulence through atmospheric tomography for high altitude correction. Simulation results based on the system design at the 1-meter New Vacuum Solar Telescope show that the correction uniform of the new scheme is obviously improved compared to conventional solar MCAO configuration.

Our lens modeling shows that the asymmetry in the doublehorned CO(J = 2 -> 1) line profile is mainly a result of differential lensing, where the magnification factor varies from similar to 3 to similar to 9 across different kinematic components. The intrinsically symmetric line profile and a smooth source-plane velocity gradient suggest that the host galaxy is an extended rotating disk, with a CO size of R-CO similar to 6 kpc and a dynamical mass of M-dyn similar to 8 x 10(10) M-circle dot. We also find a secondary CO-emitting source near RXS J1131-1231, the location of which is consistent with the optically-faint companion reported in previous studies. The lensing-corrected molecular gas masses are M-gas = (1.4 +/- 0.3) x 10(10)M(circle dot) and (2.0 +/- 0.1) x 10(9)M(circle dot) for RXS J1131-1231 and the companion, respectively. We find a lensing-corrected stellar mass of M* = (3 +/- 1) x 10(10)M(circle dot) and a star formation rate of SFRFIR = (120 +/- 63) M-circle dot yr(-1), corresponding to a specific SFR and star formation efficiency comparable to z similar to 1 disk galaxies not hosting quasars. The implied gas mass fraction of similar to 18 +/- 4% is consistent with the previously observed cosmic decline since z similar to 2. We thus find no evidence for quenching of star formation in RXS J1131-1231. This agrees with our finding of an elevatedM(BH)/M-bulge ratio of > 0.27(-0.08)(+0.11)% compared to the local value, suggesting that the bulk of its black hole mass is largely in place while its stellar bulge is still assembling.","Authors":"Leung, TKD (Leung, T.

For this purpose, we use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to define the bending angle of light, such that the definition can be valid also in the strong deflection limit. Finally, this method is applied to Schwarzschild spacetime in order to discuss also possible observational implications. The proposed corrections for Sgr A* for instance are able to amount to similar to 10(-5) arcseconds for some parameter range, which may be within the capability of near-future astronomy, while also the correction for the Sun in the weak-field limit is similar to 10(-5) arcseconds.","Authors":"Ishihara, A (Ishihara, Asahi) ; Suzuki, Y (Suzuki, Yusuke) ; Ono, T (Ono, Toshiaki) ; Asada, H (Asada, Hideki)","Title":"Finite-distance corrections to the gravitational bending angle of light in the strong deflection limit"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000394097100005 PubMed ID: 28256847 ISSN: 0031-9007 eISSN: 1079-7114","Categories":"Physics Web of Science Categories:Physics, Multidisciplinary","Journal Information":"PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS Volume: 118 Issue: 7 Article Number: 072001 DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.072001 Published: FEB 15 2017","Abstract":"The small-x gluon in global fits of parton distributions is affected by large uncertainties from the lack of direct experimental constraints.

Homogeneous infrared observations of large samples of stars belonging to GCs and the Galactic bulge field are one of the best ways to study these problems. We report the discovery by APOGEE (Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment) of a population of field stars in the inner Galaxy with abundances of N, C, and Al that are typically found in GC stars. The newly discovered stars have high [N/Fe], which is correlated with [Al/Fe] and anticorrelated with [C/Fe]. They are homogeneously distributed across, and kinematically indistinguishable from, other field stars within the same volume. Their metallicity distribution is seemingly unimodal, peaking at [Fe/H] similar to -1, thus being in disagreement with that of the Galactic GC system. Our results can be understood in terms of different scenarios. N-rich stars could be former members of dissolved GCs, in which case the mass in destroyed GCs exceeds that of the surviving GC system by a factor of similar to 8. In that scenario, the total mass contained in so-called 'first-generation' stars cannot be larger than that in 'second-generation' stars by more than a factor of similar to 9 and was certainly smaller. Conversely, our results may imply the absence of a mandatory genetic link between 'second-generation' stars and GCs. Last, but not least, N-rich stars could be the oldest stars in the Galaxy, the by-products of chemical enrichment by the first stellar generations formed in the heart of the Galaxy.","Authors":"Schiavon, RP (Schiavon, Ricardo P.) ; Zamora, O (Zamora, Olga) ; Carrera, R (Carrera, Ricardo) ; Lucatello, S (Lucatello, Sara) ; Robin, AC (Robin, A.

Each of the two telescopes is currently equipped with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) based imaging camera. Due to the advances in the development of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs), they are becoming a widely used alternative to PMTs in many research fields including gamma-ray astronomy. Within the Otto-Hahn group at the Max Planck Institute for Physics, Munich, we are developing a SiPM based detector module for a possible upgrade of the MAGIC cameras and also for future experiments as, e.g., the Large Size Telescopes (LST) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Because of the small size of individual SiPM sensors (6 mm x 6 mm) With respect to the 1-inch diameter PMTs currently used in MAGIC, we use a custom-made matrix of SiPMs to cover the same detection area. We developed an electronic circuit to actively sum up and amplify the SiPM signals. Existing non-imaging hexagonal light concentrators (Winston cones) used in MAGIC have been modified for the angular acceptance of the SiPMs by using C+ + based ray tracing simulations. The first prototype based detector module includes seven channels and was installed into the MAGIC camera in May 2015. We present the results of the first prototype and its performance as well as the status of the project and discuss its challenges. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Variations of DEPFETs can be tuned to specific requirements as to be sensitive only in predetermined time intervals, to measure signal charge with sub-electron precision, dead-time free-readout and with signal compression. These devices have been shown to work in simulations and in prototypes. Recently the first two fully developed detector systems have been finished and installed in the MIXS (Mercury Image X-ray Spectrometer) instrument of the Mercury Planetary Orbiter scheduled to be launched in 2017. A further DEPFET detector system under development is the DSSC (Depfet Sensor with Signal Compression) that will be installed in one of the beam-lines of XFEL. The requirements of the two projects are rather different. While the MIXS sensors are supposed to measure precisely the energy and position of single photons down to very low energies but at moderate rates, the DSSC has to measure the number of photons arriving in each pixel within a time interval of 220 ns. Here the challenge is the capability of detecting single X-ray photons in one pixel simultaneously with up to 10,000 photons in some other pixels. Device functioning has been verified with sensors produced in a research laboratory. Now process and design have been adapted to an industrial type production line, allowing additional improvements.

The SSTs are dedicated to the observation of gamma-rays with energy between a few TeV and a few hundreds of TeV. The SST array is expected to have 70 telescopes of different designs. The single-mirror small size telescope (SST-1 M) is one of the proposed telescope designs under consideration for the SST array. It will be equipped with a 4 m diameter segmented mirror dish and with an innovative camera based on silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). The challenge is not only to build a telescope with exceptional performance but to do it foreseeing its mass production. To address both of these challenges, the camera adopts innovative solutions both for the optical system and readout. The Photo-Detection Plane (PDP) of the camera is composed of 1296 pixels, each made of a hollow, hexagonal light guide coupled to a hexagonal SiPM designed by the University of Geneva and Hamamatsu. As no commercial ASIC would satisfy the CTA requirements when coupled to such a large sensor, dedicated preamplifier electronics have been designed. The readout electronics also use an innovative approach in gamma-ray astronomy by adopting a fully digital approach. All signals coming from the PDP are digitized in a 250 MHz Fast ADC and stored in ring buffers waiting for a trigger decision to send them to the pre-processing server where calibration and higher level triggers will decide whether the data are stored. The latest generation of FPGAs is used to achieve high data rates and also to exploit all the flexibility of the system. As an example each event can be flagged according to its trigger pattern. All of these features have been demonstrated in laboratory measurements on realistic elements and the results of these measurements will be presented in this contribution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We present an analysis of observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope, Herschel Space Observatory, Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, and AKARI of the infrared shell surrounding the pulsar wind nebula in the supernova remnant G54.1+0.3. We attribute a distinctive spectral feature at 21 mu m to a magnesium silicate grain species that has been invoked in modeling the ejecta-condensed dust in Cas A, which exhibits the same spectral signature. If this species is responsible for producing the observed spectral feature and accounts for a significant fraction of the observed infrared continuum, we find that it would be the dominant constituent of the dust in G54.1+0.3, with possible secondary contributions from other compositions, such as carbon, silicate, or alumina grains. The total mass of SN-formed dust required by this model is at least 0.3M(circle dot). We discuss how these results may be affected by varying dust grain properties and self-consistent grain heating models. The spatial distribution of the dust mass and temperature in G54.1+0.3 confirms the scenario in which the SN-formed dust has not yet been processed by the SN reverse shock and is being heated by stars belonging to a cluster in which the SN progenitor exploded. The dust mass and composition suggest a progenitor mass of 16-27M(circle dot) and imply a high dust condensation efficiency, similar to that found for Cas A and SN. 1987A. The study provides another example of significant dust formation in a Type IIP SN explosion and sheds light on the properties of pristine SN-condensed dust.","Authors":"Temim, T (Temim, Tea) ; Dwek, E (Dwek, Eli) ; Arendt, RG (Arendt, Richard G.) ; Borkowski, KJ (Borkowski, Kazimierz J.) ; Reynolds, SP (Reynolds, Stephen P.) ; Slane, P (Slane, Patrick) ; Gelfand, JD (Gelfand, Joseph D.) ; Raymond, JC (Raymond, John C.)

Here, we extend this technique by compiling a library of optical spectra of 404 touchstone stars observed with Keck/HIRES by the California Planet Search. The spectra have high resolution (R approximate to 60,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N approximate to 150/pixel), and are registered onto a common wavelength scale. The library stars have properties derived from interferometry, asteroseismology, LTE spectral synthesis, and spectrophotometry. To address a lack of well-characterized late-K dwarfs in the literature, we measure stellar radii and temperatures for 23 nearby K dwarfs, using modeling of the spectral energy distribution and Gaiaparallaxes. This library represents a uniform data set spanning the spectral types similar to M5-F1 (T-eff approximate to 3000-7000 K, R-star approximate to 0.1-16 Re). We also present \"Empirical SpecMatch\" (SpecMatch-Emp), a tool for parameterizing unknown spectra by comparing them against our spectral library. For FGKM stars, SpecMatch-Emp achieves accuracies of 100 K in effective temperature ( Teff), 15% in stellar radius (R-star), and 0.09 dex in metallicity ([Fe/H]). Because the code relies on empirical spectra it performs particularly well for stars similar to K4 and later, which are challenging to model with existing spectral synthesizers, reaching accuracies of 70 K in Teff, 10% in R-star, and 0.12 dex in [Fe/H]. We also validate the performance of SpecMatch-Emp, finding it to be robust at lower spectral resolution and S/N, enabling the characterization of faint late-type stars. Both the library and stellar characterization code are publicly available.","Authors":"Yee, SW (Yee, Samuel W.) ; Petigura, EA (Petigura, Erik A.) ; Braun, K (von Braun, Kaspar) Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number Yee, Samuel  http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7961-3907","Title":"Precision Stellar Characterization of FGKM Stars using an Empirical Spectral Library"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000393627800053 ISSN: 0370-2693 eISSN: 1873-2445","Categories":"Astronomy & Astrophysics; Physics Web of Science Categories:Astronomy & Astrophysics; Physics, Nuclear; Physics, Particles & Fields","Journal Information":"PHYSICS LETTERS B Volume: 765 Pages: 382-385 DOI: 10.1016/j.physletb.2016.12.048 Published: FEB 10 2017","Abstract":"With the advent of gravitational-wave astronomy marked by the aLIGO GW150914 and GW151226 observations, a measurement of the cosmological speed of gravity will likely soon be realised.

It will break the dark degeneracy of self-accelerated Horndeski scalar tensor theories in the large-scale structure that currently limits a rigorous discrimination between acceleration from modified gravity and from a cosmological constant or dark energy. Signatures of a self-acceleration must then manifest in the linear, unscreened cosmological structure. We describe the minimal modification required for self-acceleration with standard gravitational-wave speed and show that its maximum likelihood yields a 3 sigma poorer fit to cosmological observations compared to a cosmological constant.

Pseudo imaging does not keep physical information (intensity, or brightness in Optics) along a ray, and thus is capable of no more than qualitative imaging of bright objects. To attain quantitative imaging, cameras that realize geometrical optics is essential, which would be, for nuclear MeV gammas, only possible via complete reconstruction of the Compton process. Recently we have revealed that \"Electron Tracking Compton Camera\" (ETCC) provides a well-defined Point Spread Function (PSF). The information of an incoming gamma is kept along a ray with the PSF and that is equivalent to geometrical optics. Here we present an imaging-spectroscopic measurement with the ETCC. Our results highlight the intrinsic difficulty with CCs in performing accurate imaging, and show that the ETCC surmounts this problem. The imaging capability also helps the ETCC suppress the noise level dramatically by - 3 orders of magnitude without a shielding structure. Furthermore, full reconstruction of Compton process with the ETCC provides spectra free of Compton edges.

BeppoSAX observed GRS 1915 + 105 during two variability classes at the same 2-10 keV flux level. The rho class is characterized by quasi-periodic flares recurring on a time-scale of 1 to 2 min, namely heartbeat, while the chi class is characterized by no strong temporal variability. Aims. The aim of this work is to coherently analyze the source spectrum in these two classes and to gain insight into the source conditions that inset the heartbeats. Methods. A single chi spectrum was accumulated, while rho data were split in runs where five phase-resolved spectra were selected. In addition to the multicolor disc black body, the fitting model includes a hybrid Comptonization plus a Compton reflection component. Results. Our results show that the emission in the rho class is dominated by the multi-temperature disk, while in the chi class the Comptonised component is dominant. The disk temperature varies between a maximum of 1.95 +/- 0.11 keV reached at the peak and a minimum of 0.95(-0.20)(+0.08) keV in the chi class. In both classes we detect a significant contribution from a non-thermal electron population to the total Comptonized emission. A broadened iron emission line is detected in the chi spectrum. We interpret the line shape as being due to reflection from an accretion disk extremely close to the black-hole (R-in = 4.1(-0.9)(+1.5) gravitational radii), with an equivalent width of 200 +/- 20 eV. Concomitantly, upper limits of similar to 150 eV can be derived from the rho spectra. Conclusions. In the framework of coupled disc-corona models, these results point out that the source emission is strongly a ff ected by the fractions of accretion energy distributed between the disk, the corona, and possibly the wind, with no indication on the conditions that inset the heartbeats.","Authors":"Mineo, T (Mineo, T.) ; Del Santo, M (Del Santo, M.) ; Massaro, E (Massaro, E.) ; Massa, F (Massa, F.) ; D'Ai, A (D'Ai, A.)","Title":"Comparing the rho and chi class spectra of the microquasar GRS 1915+105 observed with BeppoSAX"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000394465000007 ISSN: 1432-0746","Keywords":"editorials, notices; line: identification; methods: analytical; methods: data analysis; methods: numerical KeyWords Plus:EXTRAORDINARY SOURCES ANALYSIS; ORION-KL; HERSCHEL OBSERVATIONS; SAGITTARIUS B2(N); MOLECULAR-SPECTROSCOPY; COLOGNE DATABASE; MILLIMETER; SUBMILLIMETER; CDMS; GAS","Categories":"Astronomy & Astrophysics Web of Science Categories:Astronomy & Astrophysics","Journal Information":"ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS Volume: 598 Article Number: A7 DOI: 10.1051/0004-6361/201527203 Published: FEB 2017","Abstract":"The eXtended CASA Line Analysis Software Suite (XCLASS) is a toolbox for the Common Astronomy Software Applications package (CASA) containing new functions for modeling interferometric and single dish data.

Additionally, the toolbox provides an interface for the model optimizer package Modeling and Analysis Generic Interface for eXternal numerical codes (MAGIX), which helps to find the best description of observational data using myXCLASS (or another external model program), that is, finding the parameter set that most closely reproduces the data.","Authors":"Moller, T (Moeller, T.) ; Endres, C (Endres, C.) ; Schilke, P (Schilke, P.)","Title":"eXtended CASA Line Analysis Software Suite (XCLASS)"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000394465000078 ISSN: 1432-0746","Keywords":"atlases; stars: atmospheres; stars: late-type; techniques: spectroscopic; infrared: stars; atmospheric effects KeyWords Plus:COOL STARS; FUNDAMENTAL PARAMETERS; STELLAR SPECTRA; M DWARFS; BAND; PHOTOMETRY","Categories":"Astronomy & Astrophysics Web of Science Categories:Astronomy & Astrophysics","Journal Information":"ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS Volume: 598 Article Number: A79 DOI: 10.1051/0004-6361/201629244 Published: FEB 2017","Abstract":"Context. High resolution stellar spectral atlases are valuable resources to astronomy. They are rare in the 1-5 mu m region for historical reasons, but once available, high resolution atlases in this part of the spectrum will aid the study of a wide range of astrophysical phenomena. Aims. The aim of the CRIRES-POP project is to produce a high resolution near-infrared spectral library of stars across the H-R diagram. The aim of this paper is to present the fully reduced spectrum of the K giant 10 Leo that will form the basis of the first atlas within the CRIRES-POP library, to provide a full description of the data reduction processes involved, and to provide an update on the CRIRES-POP project. Methods. All CRIRES-POP targets were observed with almost 200 different observational settings of CRIRES on the ESO Very Large Telescope, resulting in a basically complete coverage of its spectral range as accessible from the ground. We reduced the spectra of 10 Leo with the CRIRES pipeline, corrected the wavelength solution and removed telluric absorption with Molecfit, then resampled the spectra to a common wavelength scale, shifted them to rest wavelengths, flux normalised, and median combined them into one final data product. Results. We present the fully reduced, high resolution, near-infrared spectrum of 10 Leo. This is also the first complete spectrum from the CRIRES instrument. The spectrum is available online. Conclusions. The first CRIRES-POP spectrum has exceeded our quality expectations and will form the centre of a state-of-the-art stellar atlas. This first CRIRES-POP atlas will soon be available, and further atlases will follow. All CRIRES-POP data products will be freely and publicly available online.","Authors":"Nicholls, CP (Nicholls, C.

Traditionally, in the field of astronomy, static background subtraction based on a median image technique has been used to extract moving space objects prior to the tracking operation, as this is computationally efficient. The main disadvantage of this technique is that it is not robust to variable illumination conditions. In this article, we propose an approach for tracking small and dim space debris in the context of a dynamic background via one of the optical telescopes that is part of the space surveillance network project, named the AsiaPacific ground-based Optical Space Observation System or APOSOS. The approach combines a fuzzy running Gaussian average for robust moving-object extraction with dim-target tracking using a particlefilter-based track-before-detect method. The performance of the proposed algorithm is experimentally evaluated, and the results show that the scheme achieves a satisfactory level of accuracy for space debris tracking.","Authors":"Torteeka, P (Torteeka, Peerapong) ; Gao, PQ (Gao, Peng-Qi) ; Shen, M (Shen, Ming) ; Guo, XZ (Guo, Xiao-Zhang) ; Yang, DT (Yang, Da-Tao) ; Yu, HH (Yu, Huan-Huan) ; Zhou, WP (Zhou, Wei-Ping) ; Zhao, Y (Zhao, You)","Title":"Space debris tracking based on fuzzy running Gaussian average adaptive particle filter track-before-detect algorithm"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:Chinese Accession Number: WOS:000397300600034 ISSN: 1000-3290","Keywords":"Antarctic astronomy; optical turbulence; estimating method; sensitivity analysis","Categories":"Physics Web of Science Categories:Physics, Multidisciplinary","Journal Information":"ACTA PHYSICA SINICA Volume: 66 Issue: 3 Article Number: 039201 DOI: 10.7498/aps.66.039201 Published: FEB 2017","Abstract":"Turbulence intensity in the near-surface layer and its decrease rate with height are closely related to the quality of potential sites. Astronomers have been pursuing a perfect astronomical site to place the large-aperture telescopes. Compared with the best mid-latitude sites, Antarctic plateau inevitably becomes an ideal site for building the nextgeneration large optical and infrared telescopes, which is because of its low infrared sky emission, low atmospheric precipitable water vapour content, low aerosol and dust content of the atmosphere, and light pollution. In this paper, we establish a model of the atmospheric optical turbulence in surface layer, and use it to estimate C-n(2) at Antarctic Taishan station for the first time. The meteorological parameters of the model input are the data measured by a mobile atmospheric parameter measurement system at Antarctic Taishan station from 30 December 2013 to 10 February 2014. The values of C-n(2), estimated by the model and measured by a micro-thermometer, are compared. Sensitivity analysis of the estimation method is also carried out. The measurement results and analyses show that C2n obtained at Taishan station has obvious diurnal variation characteristics, with well-behaved peaks in the daytime and nighttime, and minima near sunrise and sunset. C-n(2) obtained in the nighttime is stronger than that in daytime, more specifically, it is on the order of 2 *10(14)m(2/3). The comparison between model predictions and experimental data demonstrates that it is feasible to estimate C-n(2) in Antarctic by using this model. The biggest differences between C-n(2) values obtained from the model and measurement usually emerge at sunrise and sunset, respectively. Considering the fact that Antarctic atmosphere is in a stable state most of the time, the values of C-n(2) estimated by different nondimensional structure parameter functions are nearly the same. Thus, the measurement accuracy of air temperature difference from one height to another is the main factor that affects the estimated value of C-n(2).","Authors":"Wu, XQ (Wu Xiao-Qing) ; Tian, QG (Tian Qi-Guo) ; Jin, XM (Jin Xin-Miao) ; Jiang, P (Jiang Peng) ; Qing, C (Qing Chun) ; Cai, J (Cai Jun) ; Zhou, HY (Zhou Hong-Yan)","Title":"Estimating optical turbulence of atmospheric surface layer at Antarctic Taishan station from meteorological data"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395432700001 ISSN: 0004-6256 eISSN: 1538-3881","Keywords":"methods: data analysis; techniques: image processing; techniques: photometric KeyWords Plus:HOT JUPITER; F-STAR; REPRESENTATIONS; COMPANION; PERIOD; KELT; FITS","Categories":"Astronomy & Astrophysics Web of Science Categories:Astronomy & Astrophysics","Journal Information":"ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL Volume: 153 Issue: 2 Article Number: 77 DOI: 10.3847/1538-3881/153/2/77 Published: FEB 2017","Abstract":"ImageJ is a graphical user interface (GUI) driven, public domain, Java-based, software package for general image processing traditionally used mainly in life sciences fields.

New technologies are now being developed that involve high-power lasers firing at 1 gram solar sails in near-Earth orbits, accelerating them to 20% the speed of light (c) within minutes. Although such an interstellar probe could reach Proxima 20 years after launch, without propellant to slow it down it would traverse the system within hours. Here we demonstrate how the stellar photon pressures of the stellar triple alpha Cen A, B, and C (Proxima) can be used together with gravity assists to decelerate incoming solar sails from Earth. The maximum injection speed at alpha Cen A to park a sail with a mass-to-surface ratio (sigma) similar to graphene (7.6 x 10(-4) gram m(-2)) in orbit around Proxima is about 13,800 km s(-1) (4.6% c), implying travel times from Earth to a Cen A and B of about 95 years and another 46 years (with a residual velocity of 1280 km s(-1)) to Proxima. The size of such a low-sigma sail required to carry a payload of 10 grams is about 105 m(2) = (316 m)(2). Such a sail could use solar photons instead of an expensive laser system to gain interstellar velocities at departure. Photogravitational assists allow visits of three stellar systems and an Earth-sized potentially habitable planet in one shot, promising extremely high scientific yields.","Authors":"Heller, R (Heller, Rene) ; Hippke, M (Hippke, Michael)","Title":"Deceleration of High-velocity Interstellar Photon Sails into Bound Orbits at alpha Centauri"}]
