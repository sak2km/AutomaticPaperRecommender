In these problems the defender first selects a subset of assets to protect, the attacker next damages a subset of unprotected assets in the \"interdiction\" stage, after which the defender optimizes a \"recourse\" problem over the surviving assets. These problems are notoriously difficult to optimize, and almost always require the recourse problem to be a convex optimization problem. Our contribution is a new approach to solving defender-attacker-defender problems. We require all variables in the first two stages to be binary-valued, but allow the recourse problem to take any form. The proposed framework focuses on solving the interdiction problem by restricting the defender to select a recourse decision from a sample of feasible vectors. The algorithm then iteratively refines the sample to force finite convergence to an optimal solution. We demonstrate that our algorithm not only solves interdiction problems involving NP-hard recourse problems within reasonable computational limits, but it also solves shortest path fortification and interdiction problems more efficiently than state-of-the-art algorithms tailored for that problem, finding optimal solutions to real-road networks having up to 300,000 nodes and over 1,000,000 arcs.","Authors":"Lozano, L (Lozano, Leonardo) ; Smith, JC (Smith, J.

Recently, several fast algorithms were proposed for solving this problem such as Lin-Han algorithm, maximum 2-dimensional inside ball algorithm, sequential 2-dimensional projection algorithm and hybrid projection algorithms of Dai. In this paper, we rewrite the problem as a constrained convex optimization problem with separable objective functions, which enables the use of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Furthermore, since the efficiency of ADMM depends on the penalty parameter, we choose it in a self-adaptive manner, resulting in the self-adaptive ADMM (S-ADMM). All these methods converge with a global linear rate. We compare them theoretically and numerically and find that S-ADMM is the most efficient one. We also illustrate the flexibility of ADMM by applying it to the more general problem of projecting a point onto the intersection of several ellipsoids, Dantzig selector, and image restoration and reconstruction.

The extension to mixed markets of a medium-term model, successfully employed for auction-only markets, is presented. It results in a non-convex expected revenue function to be maximized subject to constraints, for which the currently available direct global-optimization solvers prove not to be efficient enough.

Frequently, this task is facilitated by identifying linear equality constraints that all integer solutions must satisfy. Typically, some of these constraints are readily available but others need to be discovered by more technical means. This paper develops a method to assist modellers to obtain such equality constraints. Note that the set of new equality constraints is not unique, and the proposed method generates a set of these new equality constraints for a sufficiently large dimension of the underlying problem. These generated constraints may be of a form that is easily extended for general case of the underlying problem, or they may be in a more complicated form where a generalisable pattern is difficult to identify. For the latter case, a new mixed-integer program is developed to detect a pattern-recognisable constraints. Furthermore, this mixed-integer program allows modellers to check if there is a new constraint satisfying specific criteria, such as only permitting coefficients to be 1, 0, and -1, or placing a limit on the number of non-zero coefficients. In order to illustrate the proposed method, a set of new equality constraints to supplement a previously published \"Base polytope\" are derived. Subsequently, exploiting these results, some techniques are proposed to tighten integer programming problems. Finally, relaxations of widely used TSP formulations are compared against one another and strengthened with help of the newly discovered equality constraints, (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We consider an alternative Markowitz's mean-variance model in which the variance is replaced with an industry standard risk measure, Value-at Risk (VaR), in order to better assess market risk exposure associated with financial and commodity asset price fluctuations. Realistic portfolio optimization in the mean-VaR framework is a challenging problem since it leads to a non-convex NP-hard problem which is computationally intractable. In this work, an efficient learning-guided hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MODE-GL) is proposed to solve mean-VaR portfolio optimization problems with real-world constraints such as cardinality, quantity, pre-assignment, round-lot and class constraints. A learning-guided solution generation strategy is incorporated into the multi-objective optimization process to promote efficient convergence by guiding the evolutionary search towards promising regions of the search space. The proposed algorithm is compared with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2). Experimental results using historical daily financial market data from S & P 100 and S & P 500 indices are presented. The results show that MODE-GL outperforms two existing techniques for this important class of portfolio investment problems in terms of solution quality and computational time. The results highlight that the proposed algorithm is able to solve the complex portfolio optimization without simplifications while obtaining good solutions in reasonable time and has significant potential for use in practice.

In that work, only a positivity constraint was considered, and the problem was solved by an approximated Gauss-Seidel method. In this paper, we propose to improve the approach on three fundamental aspects. First, we define the estimated image as a solution of a regularized minimization problem, promoting sparsity in a fixed dictionary using either an l(1) or a (re) weighted-l(1) regularization term. Secondly, we solve the resultant non-convex minimization problem using a block-coordinate forward-backward algorithm. This algorithm is able to deal both with smooth and non-smooth functions, and benefits from convergence guarantees even in a non-convex context. Finally, we generalize our model and algorithm to the hyperspectral case, promoting a joint sparsity prior through an l(2,1)regularizationterm.

However it is challenging for the stitching optimization to get the real surface error because the surface error is strongly coupled with misalignment-induced aberrations in near-null subaperture measurements. Aiming at this challenge, we first figure out the property of aberrations induced by misalignment of optical null or test surface. It shows that identical misalignment of the optical null introduces nearly identical aberrations to subapertures with different off-axis distances, while misalignment of the test surface introduces little aberrations to the central subaperture. The stitching algorithm is then proposed with focus on decoupling surface error and induced aberrations. The major step is to calibrate out the effect of misaligned near-null optics before stitching optimization by using the central subaperture measurement. We also present the through-the back null test for the purpose of cross test.

The intermittency and uncertainty introduced by renewable energy generation requires expanded ancillary services to maintain this balance. In this paper, we examine the potential of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), such as refrigerators and electric water heaters, to provide generation following services in real-time energy markets (1-5 min). Previous research in this area has primarily focused on the development of centralized control schemes with an aggregate TCL model. An objective of our approach is to enable each TCL to model and control its dynamics independently and to use distributed convex optimization techniques to allow a central aggregator to influence, but not directly control, the behavior of the population. To control the non-linear dynamics of hysteretic dead band systems in a manner suitable for convex optimization, we introduce an alternative control trajectory representation of the TCLs and their discrete input signals. This approach allows us to approximate the control of a TCL as a convex program and to produce a solution that can be interpreted stochastically for implementation. To perform distributed optimization across large populations of TCLs, we apply a variation of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The objective of the distributed optimization algorithm is to enable an aggregator to coordinate with a population of TCLs and to increase or decrease the total power demand according to a control signal. We include experimental results in which different populations of TCLs with varying levels heterogeneity are optimized to provide 5-min ahead generation following services. We numerically demonstrate the algorithm's potential for controlling a TCL population's power demand within a definable error tolerance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This nonconvex problem may be convexified into a semidefinite rank-one matrix recovery problem, known as PhaseLift. Under a linear number of Gaussian measurements, PhaseLift recovers the unknown vector exactly with high probability. Under noisy measurements, the solution to a variant of PhaseLift has error proportional to the.ej. norm of the noise. In the present paper, we study the robustness of this variant of PhaseLift to gross, arbitrary corruptions. We prove that PhaseLift can tolerate noise and a small, fixed fraction of gross errors, even in the highly underdetermined regime where there are only O(n) measurements. The lifted phase retrieval problem can be viewed as a rank-one robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA) problem under generic rank-one measurements. From this perspective, the proposed convex program is simpler than the semidefinite version of the sparse-plus-low-rank formulation standard in the robust PCA literature. Specifically, the rank penalization through a trace term is unnecessary, and the resulting optimization program has no parameters that need to be chosen. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To lessen the computational burden and delay incurred onto the receiver, we estimate phase noise using only scattered pilot subcarriers, i.e., no tentative symbol decisions are used in obtaining and improving the phase noise estimate. In particular, the phase noise estimation problem is posed as an unconstrained optimization problem whose minimizer suffers from the so-called amplitude and phase estimation error. These errors arise due to receiver noise, estimation from limited scattered pilot subcarriers and estimation using a dimensionality reduction model. It is empirically shown that, at high signal-to-noise-ratios, the phase estimation error is small. To reduce the amplitude estimation error, we restrict the minimizer to be drawn from the so-called phase noise geometry set when minimizing the cost function. The resulting optimization problem is a nonconvex program. However, using the S-procedure for quadratic equalities, we show that the optimal solution can be obtained by solving the convex dual problem. We also consider a less complex heuristic scheme that achieves the same objective of restricting the minimizer to the phase noise geometry set. Through simulations, we demonstrate improved coded bit-error-rate and phase noise estimation error performance when enforcing the phase noise geometry. For example, at high signal-to-noise-ratios, the probability density function of the phase noise estimation error exhibits thinner tails which results in lower bit-error-rate.","Authors":"Mathecken, P (Mathecken, Pramod) ; Riihonen, T (Riihonen, Taneli) ; Werner, S (Werner, Stefan) ; Wichman, R (Wichman, Risto)","Title":"Constrained Phase Noise Estimation in OFDM Using Scattered Pilots Without Decision Feedback"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395877600013 ISSN: 1053-587X eISSN: 1941-0476","Keywords":"Massive MIMO; power control; power allocation; convex optimization KeyWords Plus:OPTIMIZATION; ALLOCATION; ANTENNAS","Categories":"Engineering Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Journal Information":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING Volume: 65 Issue: 9 Pages: 2363-2378 DOI: 10.1109/TSP.2016.2641381 Published: MAY 1 2017","Abstract":"This paper considers the jointly optimal pilot and data power allocation in single-cell uplink massive multiple-input-multiple- output systems.

A closed form solution for the optimal length of the pilot sequence is derived. The optimal power control policy for the former problem is found by solving a simple equation with a single variable.

In this regard, speckle reduction is a crucial prerequisite of many computer aided ultrasound diagnosis and treatment systems However, removing speckle noise while simultaneously preserving features in ultrasound images is a challenging task. We propose a novel optimization framework for speckle reduction by leveraging the concept of phase congruency and incorporating a feature asymmetry metric into the regularization term of the objective function to effectively distinguish the features and speckle noise. The feature asymmetry metric can productively separate features from speckle noise by analyzing the local frequency information. Compared with traditional methods employing intensity gradients as regularization terms, our framework is invariant to the intensity amplitude of features so that low contrast features are almost equally protected as high contrast features. In addition, rather than adopting the gradient descent, we propose a novel solver by decomposing the Original non convex optimization into solving several linear systems, leading to an efficient solution of the optimization. Owing to different penalties on speckle noise and features, our method can efficiently remove speckle noise and preserve features at the same time. Experiments on simulated and real ultrasound images demonstrate our method can better maintain features with speckle removal than state-of-the-art methods, especially for the low contrast features.","Authors":"Zhu, L (Zhu, Lei) ; Wang, WM (Wang, Weiming) ; Qin, J (Qin, Jing) ; Wong, KH (Wong, Kin-Hong) ; Choi, KS (Choi, Kup-Sze) ; Heng, PA (Heng, Pheng-Ann)","Title":"Fast feature-preserving speckle reduction for ultrasound images via phase congruency"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000393243800030 ISSN: 0165-1684 eISSN: 1879-2677","Keywords":"Adaptive signal processing; Set-membership filtering; Affine projection; Convex optimization KeyWords Plus:QUASI-OBE ALGORITHM; ADAPTIVE-FILTERING ALGORITHM; MEAN-SQUARE PERFORMANCE; NLMS ALGORITHM; IMPLEMENTATION; IDENTIFICATION; ERROR","Categories":"Engineering Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Journal Information":"SIGNAL PROCESSING Volume: 134 Pages: 285-294 DOI: 10.1016/j.sigpro.2016.11.025 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"There is a growing interest in adaptive filtering solutions whose learning processes are data selective, bringing about computational reduction and energy savings while improving estimation accuracy.

The SAND problem is characterized by a large number of nonlinear equality constraints (the equations of equilibrium) that are linearized in the approximate convex subproblems. The availability of cheap second-order information is exploited in a Lagrange-Newton sequential quadratic programming-like framework.

Theoretical considerations reveal that the dual statement of the proposed subproblem for SAND minimum compliance design agrees with the ever-popular optimality criterion method - which is a nested analysis and design formulation. This relates, in turn, to the known equivalence between rudimentary dual sequential approximate optimization algorithms based on reciprocal (and exponential) intervening variables and the optimality criterion method.

Important examples are for instance the Schur and Hurwitz stability domains. These sets often have very complicated shapes (nonconvex, and even non-connected), which render difficult their manipulation. It is therefore of considerable importance to find simple-enough approximations of these sets, able to capture their main characteristics while maintaining a low level of complexity. For these reasons, in the past years several convex approximations, based for instance on hyperrectangles, polytopes, or ellipsoids have been proposed. In this work, we move a step further, and propose possibly nonconvex yet still simple approximations, based on a small volume polynomial superlevel set of a single positive polynomial of given degree. We show how these sets can be easily approximated by minimizing the L-1 norm of the polynomial over the semialgebraic set, subject to positivity constraints. Intuitively, this corresponds to the trace minimization heuristic commonly encountered in minimum volume ellipsoid problems. From a computational viewpoint, we design a hierarchy of convex linear matrix inequality problems to generate these approximations, and we provide theoretically rigorous convergence results, in the sense that the hierarchy of outer approximations converges in volume (or, equivalently, almost everywhere and almost uniformly) to the original set. Finally, we show how the concept of polynomial superlevel set can be used to generate samples uniformly distributed on a given semialgebraic set. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated by different numerical examples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This approach has two key differences from existing approaches to FDR analysis. First, it assumes that the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal, with a mode at 0. This \"unimodal assumption\" (UA), although natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into standard FDR analysis, and we demonstrate how incorporating it brings many benefits. Specifically, the UA facilitates efficient and robust computation-estimating the unimodal distribution involves solving a simple convex optimization problem-and enables more accurate inferences provided that it holds. Second, the method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect size estimate and corresponding standard error), rather than the one number usually used (p value or z score). When available, using two numbers instead of one helps account for variation in measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates estimation of effects, and unlike standard FDR methods, our approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each effect in addition to measures of significance. To provide a bridge between interval estimates and significance measures, we introduce the term \"local false sign rate\" to refer to the probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong and argue that it is a superior measure of significance than the local FDR because it is both more generally applicable and can be more robustly estimated.

In this paper, a novel method, robust to pose, illumination variations, and occlusions is proposed for joint face frontalization and landmark localization. Unlike the state-of-the-art methods for landmark localization and pose correction, where large amount of manually annotated images or 3D facial models are required, the proposed method relies on a small set of frontal images only. By observing that the frontal facial image of both humans and animals, is the one having the minimum rank of all different poses, a model which is able to jointly recover the frontalized version of the face as well as the facial landmarks is devised. To this end, a suitable optimization problem is solved, concerning minimization of the nuclear norm (convex surrogate of the rank function) and the matrix l(1) norm accounting for occlusions. The proposed method is assessed in frontal view reconstruction of human and animal faces, landmark localization, pose-invariant face recognition, face verification in unconstrained conditions, and video inpainting by conducting experiment on 9 databases.

They may also be adapted to yield relaxations of certain implicit functions and differential equation solutions. However, McCormick's relaxations may be nonsmooth, and this nonsmoothness can create theoretical and computational obstacles when relaxations are to be deployed. This article presents a continuously differentiable variant of McCormick's original relaxations in the multivariate McCormick framework of Tsoukalas and Mitsos. Gradients of the new differentiable relaxations may be computed efficiently using the standard forward or reverse modes of automatic differentiation.

The approach, a specialized branch-and-bound algorithm, is based on the computation of lower bounds provided by the minimization of separable underestimators of the polynomial objective function. The underestimators are the novelty of the approach because the standard approaches in global optimization are based on convex relaxations. Thanks to the fact that only simple bound constraints are present, minimizing the separable underestimator can be done very quickly. The underestimators are computed monomial-wise after the original polynomial has been shifted. We show that such valid underestimators exist and their degree can be bounded when the degree of the polynomial objective function is bounded, too. For the quartic case, all optimal monomial underestimators are determined analytically. We implemented and tested the branch-and-bound algorithm where these underestimators are hardcoded. The comparison against standard global optimization and polynomial optimization solvers clearly shows that our method outperforms the others, the only exception being the binary case where, though, it is still competitive. Moreover, our branch-and-bound approach suffers less in case of dense polynomial objective function, i.e., in case of polynomials having a large number of monomials.

Joint chance constrained problem enforces that several constraints are satisfied simultaneously and it is more complicated than individual chance constrained problem. This work investigates the tractable robust optimization approximation framework for solving the joint chance constrained problem. Various robust counterpart optimization formulations are derived based on different types of uncertainty set. To improve the quality of robust optimization approximation, a two-layer algorithm is proposed.

We prove, under common assumptions, that F-ADMM is globally convergent and that the iterates converge linearly. We also present a special case of F-ADMM that is partially parallelizable, which makes it attractive in a big data setting. In particular, we partition the data into groups, so that each group consists of multiple blocks of variables. By applying F-ADMM to this partitioning of the data, and using a specific regularization matrix, we obtain a hybrid ADMM (H-ADMM) algorithm: the grouped data is updated in a Gauss-Seidel fashion, and the blocks within each group are updated in a Jacobi (parallel) manner. Convergence of H-ADMM follows directly from the convergence properties of F-ADMM.

More specifically, we derive semi-analytical expressions for the precommitted efficient mean-variance policy and the minimum-variance signed supermartingale measure (VSSM) and examine their relationship. Our analysis shows that the precommitted discrete-time efficient mean-variance policy satisfies TCIE if and only if the conditional expectation of the density of the VSSM (with respect to the original probability measure) is nonnegative, or once the conditional expectation becomes negative, it remains at the same negative value until the terminal time.

This motivates us to establish a general procedure for constructing TCIE dynamic portfolio selection problems by introducing suitable portfolio constraints.","Authors":"Cui, XY (Cui, Xiangyu) ; Li, D (Li, Duan) ; Li, X (Li, Xun)","Title":"MEAN-VARIANCE POLICY FOR DISCRETE-TIME CONE-CONSTRAINED MARKETS: TIME CONSISTENCY IN EFFICIENCY AND THE MINIMUM-VARIANCE SIGNED SUPERMARTINGALE MEASURE"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396138000003 ISSN: 0929-6212 eISSN: 1572-834X","Keywords":"4G; Dynamic scheduling; Convex optimization; Simulation KeyWords Plus:ALLOCATION; SUBCARRIER","Categories":"Telecommunications Web of Science Categories:Telecommunications","Journal Information":"WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS Volume: 93 Issue: 3 Pages: 629-645 Special Issue: SI DOI: 10.1007/s11277-014-2218-9 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"LTE-Advanced aims to provide a transmission bandwidth of 100 MHz by using carrier aggregation to aggregate LTE Rel. 8 carriers.

For the hierarchical convex optimization, the hybrid steepest descent method (HSDM) can be applied, where the solution set of the first stage problem must be expressed as the fixed point set of a certain nonexpansive operator. In this paper, we propose a nonexpansive operator that yields a computationally efficient update when it is plugged into the HSDM. The proposed operator is inspired by the update of the linearized augmented Lagrangian method. It is applicable to characterize the solution set of recent sophisticated convex optimization problems found in the context of inverse problems, where the sum of multiple proximable convex functions involving linear operators must be minimized to incorporate preferable properties into the minimizers. For such a problem formulation, there has not yet been reported any nonexpansive operator that yields an update free from the inversions of linear operators in cases where it is utilized in the HSDM. Unlike previously known nonexpansive operators, the proposed operator yields an inversion-free update in such cases. As an application of the proposed operator plugged into the HSDM, we also present, in the context of the so-called superiorization, an algorithmic solution to a convex optimization problem over the generalized convex feasible set where the intersection of the hard constraints is not necessarily simple.","Authors":"Yamagishi, M (Yamagishi, Masao) ; Yamada, I (Yamada, Isao)","Title":"Nonexpansiveness of a linearized augmented Lagrangian operator for hierarchical convex optimization"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395352600001 ISSN: 0885-064X eISSN: 1090-2708","Keywords":"Convex optimization; Complexity; Rate of convergence; Information-based complexity","Categories":"Computer Science; Mathematics Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF COMPLEXITY Volume: 39 Pages: 1-16 DOI: 10.1016/j.jco.2016.11.001 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"We obtain a new lower bound on the information-based complexity of first-order minimization of smooth and convex functions.

This paper introduces a firsthand objective (fitness) function for finding optimal configurations. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the fitness function. The proposed method is useful for recovery of rotation and translation parameters.

To design the apodization, it is usually assumed that the medium is homogenous with a fixed value of sound speed, despite the fact that the speed may vary by a great value in practical situations. On the other hand, the beamforming performance is highly affected by the speed value. In this paper, the beampattern sensitivity to the speed variations is firstly investigated through both mathematical representations and simulation results showing that the speed errors lead to a sever degradation of the beampattern in terms of both mainlobe width and sidelobe level. Then, we consider an optimization problem robust to the speed variations which minimizes the sidelobe level while maintaining a predefined mainlobe width. Furthermore, the optimization problem is reformulated as a convex problem using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method to be solved more efficiently. The solutions are evaluated for some exemplary phased arrays at different values of focusing depths and inainlobe widths. The results show that the robust apodization is capable of maintaining the mainlobe properties for all possible values of the speed, while minimizing the sidelobe level. Moreover, the superiority of the robust method against non-robust method is highlighted at lower focusing depths and smaller mainlobe widths. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, sparse representation (SR) has become a popular technique in high-dimensional signal processing. In this paper, we provide an alternative archetypal representation (AR) to conduct the representation learning. Compared with SR, AR preserves the sparsity of the learned representation, but has a lower complexity and better interpretation. For the classification of hyperspectral image, spatial information plays an important role in improving the classification performance. Instead of representing each sample individually, we propose a globally regularized AR model, which uses graph regularization to include the contextual information into the learned representation. Although the entire model is convex, it is time consuming to obtain the optimal solution, which limits its large-scale applications. To address the computational issue, we further propose an efficient approximate solver based on line search on a feasible solution trajectory. It turns out that the approximate solution is very close the optimal solution, with a relative error less than 5% usually, but speeds up the optimization dozens of times. Experiments demonstrate that the learned representation with the approximate solution is discriminant comparable to the optimal solution. Using the learned representation as a high-level feature, a linear support vector machine works effectively to produce a high-accuracy classification.","Authors":"Ni, D (Ni, Ding) ; Ma, HB (Ma, Hongbing) Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number Ding, Ni  http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1933-8768","Title":"Fast Classification of Hyperspectral Images Using Globally Regularized Archetypal Representation With Approximate Solution"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395902900002 PubMed ID: 28092550 ISSN: 1057-7149 eISSN: 1941-0042","Keywords":"L-0 gradient; edge-preserving filtering; nonconvex optimization KeyWords Plus:CONVEX-OPTIMIZATION; IMAGE; MINIMIZATION; CONVERGENCE; ALGORITHM; SPARSE","Categories":"Computer Science; Engineering Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Journal Information":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING Volume: 26 Issue: 4 Pages: 1554-1564 DOI: 10.1109/TIP.2017.2651392 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Minimizing L-0 gradient, the number of the nonzero gradients of an image, together with a quadratic data-fidelity to an input image has been recognized as a powerful edge-preserving filtering method. However, the L-0 gradient minimization has an inherent difficulty: a user-given parameter controlling the degree of flatness does not have a physical meaning since the parameter just balances the relative importance of the L-0 gradient term to the quadratic data-fidelity term. As a result, the setting of the parameter is a troublesome work in the L-0 gradient minimization. To circumvent the difficulty, we propose a new edge-preserving filtering method with a novel use of the L-0 gradient. Our method is formulated as the minimization of the quadratic data-fidelity subject to the hard constraint that the L-0 gradient is less than a user-given parameter a. This strategy is much more intuitive than the L-0 gradient minimization because the parameter a has a clear meaning: the L-0 gradient value of the output image itself, so that one can directly impose a desired degree of flatness by a. We also provide an efficient algorithm based on the so-called alternating direction method of multipliers for computing an approximate solution of the nonconvex problem, where we decompose it into two subproblems and derive closed-form solutions to them.

Due to the high mobility, large scale, and limited contact time between vehicles, it is quite challenging to support the multimedia data dissemination in VANETs. In this paper, we first utilize a hybrid framework to model the VANETs to address the mobility and scalability issues. Then, we formulate a utility-based maximization problem to find the best delivery strategy and select an optimal path for the multimedia data dissemination, where the utility function has taken the delivery delay, Quality of Services (QoS), and storage cost into consideration.

With an appropriate set of weights, a spiking neuron can emit precisely timed action potentials in response to spatiotemporal input spikes. However, deriving supervised learning rules for spike mapping is nontrivial due to the increased complexity. Existing methods rely on heuristic approaches that do not guarantee a convex objective function and, therefore, may not converge to a global minimum. In this paper, we present a novel technique to obtain the weights of spiking neurons by formulating the problem in a convex optimization framework, rendering it be compatible with the established methods. We introduce techniques to influence the weight distribution and membrane trajectory, and then study how these factors affect robustness in the presence of noise. In addition, we show how the existence of a solution can be determined and assess memory capacity limits of a neuron model using synthetic examples. The practical utility of our technique is further assessed by its application to gait-event detection using the experimental data.","Authors":"Lee, WW (Lee, Wang Wei) ; Kukreja, SL (Kukreja, Sunil L.) ; Thakor, NV (Thakor, Nitish V.)","Title":"CONE: Convex-Optimized-Synaptic Efficacies for Temporally Precise Spike Mapping"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396381300008 PubMed ID: 27875232 ISSN: 2162-237X eISSN: 2162-2388","Keywords":"Convex optimization; event-related potential (ERP); N170; nuclear norm; regularization; sparse learning KeyWords Plus:BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FACE; RESPONSES; ERPS; CLASSIFICATION; DECOMPOSITION; SIGNALS","Categories":"Computer Science; Engineering Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Journal Information":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS Volume: 28 Issue: 4 Pages: 862-872 DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2496284 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Recent years have witnessed brain-computer interface (BCI) as a promising technology for integrating human intelligence and machine intelligence. Currently, event-related potential (ERP)-based BCI is an important branch of noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCIs. Extracting ERPs from a limited number of trials remains challenging due to their low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low spatial resolution caused by volume conduction. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for trial-by-trial concatenated EEG, in which the concatenated ERPs are expressed as a linear combination of a set of discrete sine and cosine bases. The bases are simply determined by the data length of a single trial. A sparse prior on the rank of the spatio-spectral pattern matrix is introduced into the model to allow the number of components to be automatically determined. A maximum posterior estimation algorithm based on cyclic descent is then developed to estimate the spatiospectral patterns. A spatial filter can then be obtained by maximizing the SNR of the ERP components. Experiments on both synthetic data and real N170 ERP from 13 subjects were conducted to test the efficacy and efficiency of the algorithm. The results showed that the proposed algorithm can estimate the ERPs more accurately than the several state-of-the-art algorithms.","Authors":"Wu, CH (Wu, Chaohua) ; Lin, K (Lin, Ke) ; Wu, W (Wu, Wei) ; Gao, XR (Gao, Xiaorong)","Title":"A Novel Algorithm for Learning Sparse Spatio-Spectral Patterns for Event-Related Potentials"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395484200007 ISSN: 1053-587X eISSN: 1941-0476","Keywords":"Cloud radio access network (C-RAN); cross-layer design; data-sharing strategy; compression-based strategy; beamforming; network coding; routing; fronthaul constraints; sparse optimization; successive convex approximation KeyWords Plus:MULTICAST","Categories":"Engineering Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Journal Information":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING Volume: 65 Issue: 7 Pages: 1728-1740 DOI: 10.1109/TSP.2017.2649486 Published: APR 1 2017","Abstract":"There are two fundamentally different fronthaul techniques in the downlink communication of cloud radio access network (C-RAN): the data-sharing strategy and the compressionbased strategy. Under the former strategy, each user's message is multicast from the central processor (CP) to all the serving remote radio heads (RRHs) over the fronthaul network, which then cooperatively serve the users through joint beamforming; while under the latter strategy, the user messages are first beamformed then quantized at the CP, and the compressed signal is unicast to the corresponding RRH, which then decompresses its received signal for wireless transmission. Previous works show that in general the compression-based strategy outperforms the datasharing strategy. This paper, on the other hand, points out that in a C-RAN model where the RRHs are connected to the CP via multihop routers, data-sharing can be superior to compression if the network coding technique is adopted for multicasting user messages to the cooperating RRHs, and the RRH's beamforming vectors, the user-RRH association, and the network coding design over the fronthaul network are jointly optimized based on the techniques of sparse optimization and successive convex approximation. This is in comparison to the compression-based strategy, where information is unicast over the fronthaul network by simple routing, and the RRH's compression noise covariance and beamforming vectors, as well as the routing strategy over the fronthaul network are jointly optimized based on the successive convex approximation technique. The observed gain in overall network throughput is due to that information multicast is more efficient than information unicast over the multihop fronthaul of a C-RAN.","Authors":"Liu, L (Liu, Liang) ; Yu, W (Yu, Wei)","Title":"Cross-Layer Design for Downlink Multihop Cloud Radio Access Networks With Network Coding"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000393217600015 ISSN: 1292-8119 eISSN: 1262-3377","Keywords":"Extremal Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalues; conformal spectrum; topological spectrum; closed Riemannian surface; spectral geometry; isoperimetric inequality KeyWords Plus:MINIMAL CONVEX COMBINATIONS; SPECTRAL PROPERTIES; 1ST EIGENVALUE; DIRICHLET EIGENVALUES; EXTREMAL EIGENVALUES; COMPOSITE MEMBRANES; COMPACT MANIFOLDS; OTSUKI TORI; OPERATOR; METRICS","Categories":"Automation & Control Systems; Mathematics Web of Science Categories:Automation & Control Systems; Mathematics, Applied","Journal Information":"ESAIM-CONTROL OPTIMISATION AND CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS Volume: 23 Issue: 2 Pages: 685-720 DOI: 10.1051/cocv/2016008 Published: APR-JUN 2017","Abstract":"Let (M, g) be a connected, closed, orientable Riemannian surface and denote by lambda(k)(M, g) the kth eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on (M, g).

In nature, the proposed approach firstly predicts the resource utilization of the upcoming period based on the Gaussian process regression method. Subsequently, the convex optimization technique is engaged to compute an appropriate quantity of physical servers for each monitoring window. This quantity of interest is calculated to ensure that a minimum number of servers can still provide an acceptable quality of service. Finally, a corresponding migrating instruction is issued to stack the virtual machines and turn off the idle physical servers to achieve the objective of energy savings. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we conduct the experiments using synthetic data from 29-day period of Google traces and real workload from the Montage open-source toolkit Through the evaluation, we show that the proposed approach can achieve a significant result in reducing the energy consumption as well as maintaining the system performance.

Also, using the S-lemma allows us to extend invariance conditions to any set represented by a quadratic inequality. Such sets include nonconvex and unbounded sets.

Using GP, the variances computed during the modelling and inference processes allow us to take model uncertainty into account. The main issue in using MPC to control systems modelled by GP is the propagation of such uncertainties within the control horizon. In this study, two approaches to solve this problem, called GPMPC1 and GPMPC2, are proposed. With GPMPC1, the original stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) problem is relaxed to a deterministic non-linear MPC based on a basic linearised GP local model. The resulting optimisation problem, though non-convex, can be solved by the sequential quadratic programming. By incorporating the model variance into the state vector, an extended local model is derived. This model allows us to relax the non-convex MPC problem to a convex one which can be solved by an active-set method efficiently. The performance of both approaches is demonstrated by applying them to two trajectory tracking problems.

By introducing a novel Bayesian method, we address the problem via reconstructing the atmospheric turbulence strength profile and the turbulent layers simultaneously, where we only use wavefrontmeasurements of incoming light from guide stars. Most importantly, we demonstrate how this method can be used for model optimization as well. We propose two different algorithms for solving the maximum a posteriori estimate: the first approach is based on alternating minimization and has the advantage of integrability into existing atmospheric tomography methods. In the second approach, we formulate a convex non-differentiable optimization problem, which is solved by an iterative thresholding method. This approach clearly illustrates the underlying sparsity-enforcing mechanism for the strength profile. By introducing a tuning/regularization parameter, an automated model reduction of the layer structure of the atmosphere is achieved. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the performance of our method in practice.

The presented algorithm is based on GSA considering three fundamental modifications to improve the quality solution and performance of original GSA. Moreover, a new optimization framework for economic dispatch is adapted to a system of energy hubs considering different hub structures, various energy carriers (electricity, gas, heat, cool, and compressed air), valve-point loading effect and prohibited zones of electric-only units, as well as the different equality and inequality constraints. To show the effectiveness of the suggested method, a high-complex energy hub system consisting of 39 hubs with 29 structures and 76 energy (electricity, gas, and heat) production units is proposed. Two individual objectives including energy cost and hub losses are minimized separately as two single-objective EHED problems.

Our approach is based on a recently proposed tensor algebraic framework where 3-D tensors are treated as linear operators over the set of 2-D tensors. In this framework, one can obtain a factorization for 3-D data, referred to as the tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD), which is similar to the SVD for matrices. t-SVD results in a notion of rank referred to as the tubal-rank. Using this approach we consider the problem of sampling and recovery of 3-D arrays with low tubal-rank. We show that by solving a convex optimization problem, which minimizes a convex surrogate to the tubal-rank, one can guarantee exact recovery with high probability as long as number of samples is of the order O(rnk log(nk)), given a tensor of size n x n x k with tubal-rank r. The conditions under which this result holds are similar to the incoherence conditions for low-rank matrix completion under random sampling. The difference is that we define incoherence under the algebraic setup of t-SVD, which is different from the standard matrix incoherence conditions.

A popular architecture for modern Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) for geo-replicated services consists of multiple layers of proxy nodes for service and co-located DNS servers for load balancing among different proxies. Both the proxies and the DNS servers use anycast addressing, which offers the simplicity of design and high availability of service at the cost of partial loss of routing control. Due to the very nature of anycast, redirection actions by a DNS server also affect load at nearby proxies in the network. This makes the problem of optimal distributed load management highly challenging. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an analytical framework to formulate and solve the load management problem in this context. We consider two distinct algorithms. In the first half of the paper, we pose the load management problem as a convex optimization problem. Following a Kelly-type dual decomposition technique, we propose a fully distributed load management algorithm by introducing a new type of control packets, called FastControl packets. This algorithm utilizes the underlying anycast mechanism to enable effective coordination among the nodes, thus obviating the need for any external control channel. In the second half of the paper, we examine an alternative greedy load management heuristic, currently in production in a major commercial CDN. We study its dynamical characteristics and analyze its operational and stability properties. Finally, we critically evaluate both the algorithms and explore their optimality-vs-complexity trade-off using trace-driven simulations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike other power network models previously proposed, power consumptions and work patterns of appliances have been considered in the authors' work. They classify appliances into elastic and inelastic ones according to their distinct constraints on power consumptions, while all appliances' work patterns are modelled based on their functions and common users' habits in reality. With the help of convex optimisation, a distributed load scheduling algorithm is proposed subject to social welfare maximisation. Simulation results confirm that the proposed load scheduling algorithm can lead to a suitable power consumption schedule to improve the social welfare than other load scheduling algorithm does.

A spherical geometry is considered consisting of a spherical suspension of colloidal GNPs characterized as an arbitrary passive dielectric material which is immersed in an arbitrary lossy medium. A relative heating coefficient and a corresponding optimal near field excitation are defined, taking the skin effect of the surrounding medium into account. The classical Mie theory for lossy media is also revisited, and it is shown that the optimal permittivity function yielding a maximal absorption inside the spherical suspension is a conjugate match with respect to the surrounding lossy material. A convex optimization approach is used to investigate the broadband realizability of an arbitrary passive material to approximate the desired conjugate match over a finite bandwidth, similar to the approximation of a metamaterial. A narrowband realizability study shows that for a surrounding medium consisting of a weak electrolyte solution, the electromagnetic heating, due to the electrophoretic (plasmonic) resonance phenomena inside the spherical GNP suspension, can be significant in the microwave regime, provided that the related Drude parameters can be tuned into (or near to) resonance. As a demonstration, some realistic Drude parameters are investigated concerning the volume fraction, mass, and friction constant of the GNPs. The amount of charge that can be accommodated by the GNPs is identified as one of the most important design parameters. However, the problem of reliably modelling, measuring and controlling the charge number of coated GNPs is not yet fully understood, and is still an open research issue in this field. The presented theory and related physical limitations provide a useful framework for further research in this direction.

The theory evokes a tradeoff between goods whereby individuals improve themselves by trading one good for another good to obtain the best combination. Preferences revealed in these choices are modeled as curves of equal choice (indifference curves) and reflect an underlying process of optimization. These notions have far-reaching applications in consumer choice theory and impact the welfare of human and animal populations. However, they lack the empirical implementation in animals that would be required to establish a common biological basis. In a design using basic features of revealed preference theory, we measured in rhesus monkeys the frequency of repeated choices between bundles of two liquids. For various liquids, the animals' choices were compatible with the notion of giving up a quantity of one good to gain one unit of another good while maintaining choice indifference, thereby implementing the concept of marginal rate of substitution. The indifference maps consisted of nonoverlapping, linear, convex, and occasionally concave curves with typically negative, but also sometimes positive, slopes depending on bundle composition. Out-of-sample predictions using homothetic polynomials validated the indifference curves. The animals' preferences were internally consistent in satisfying transitivity. Change of option set size demonstrated choice optimality and satisfied the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference (WARP). These data are consistent with a version of revealed preference theory in which preferences are stochastic; the monkeys behaved \"as if\" they had well-structured preferences and maximized utility.","Authors":"Pastor-Bernier, A (Pastor-Bernier, Alexandre) ; Plott, CR (Plott, Charles R.) ; Schultz, W (Schultz, Wolfram)","Title":"Monkeys choose as if maximizing utility compatible with basic principles of revealed preference theory"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000393534300009 ISSN: 0098-1354 eISSN: 1873-4375","Keywords":"Multi-objective optimization; Continuation techniques; Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions; Fritz-John conditions; Scalarization; Pareto front KeyWords Plus:MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; MULTICRITERIA OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN","Categories":"Computer Science; Engineering Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Chemical","Journal Information":"COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING Volume: 98 Pages: 89-99 DOI: 10.1016/j.compchemeng.2016.11.025 Published: MAR 4 2017","Abstract":"As a proof of concept the properties of path-following methods are studied for multi-objective optimization problems involving dynamic systems (also called multi-objective dynamic optimization or multi-objective optimal control problems), which have never been presented before.
