It has been recently reported that RT is related to obesity in young, adult and elderly individuals. However, most of the studies included small sample of participants, used just body mass index ( BMI) as body obesity index, and did not consider some potential confounders such as age, socioeconomic status and physical activity in their studies. Furthermore, there is little and contradictory results for children. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the relationship between RT and weight status in a sample of children. Methods: Three hundred and fifty four 9-12 year old schoolboys underwent standard anthropometry, and various simple RT tests. Results: After controlling for potential confounders no significant relationship was observed between audio-RT ( RTA) and clinical RT ( RTclin) with BMI, % fat, waist circumference ( WC) and waist to height ratio ( WHtR) ( P > 0.05). But, significant relationship ( beta = 0.18; P = 0.02) was observed between visual-RT ( RTV) and % fat ( but not BMI, WC and WHtR). Conclusions: Among the various simple RT tasks and central and total body obesity indices, just significant relationship was observed between % fat and RTV in the schoolboys. According to the results, it is concluded that RT impairment due to obesity may less be observed, or may not be observed for some types of RT tasks and obesity indices during childhood.","Authors":"Moradi, A (Moradi, Akbar) ; Esmaeilzadeh, S (Esmaeilzadeh, Samad)","Title":"Simple reaction time and obesity in children: whether there is a relationship?"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:Turkish Accession Number: WOS:000397203100010 ISSN: 1301-0549","Keywords":"Maturidi; freedom of humanity; freedom of will; kalam; psychology","Categories":"Area Studies Web of Science Categories:Area Studies","Journal Information":"BILIG Issue: 80 Pages: 239-263 Published: WIN 2017","Abstract":"Maturidi, who is one of the leading scholars in Islamic thought, lived in Transoxiana where different ideas from Islamic geography were intensively discussed.

This gap results, in part, from a lack of integration between epidemiologic science and social psychology theory, particularly regarding the intersections of stress, self-regulatory health behaviors, and the biological mechanisms underlying the development of diabetes. In this commentary, we describe the utility of a theoretical framework that focuses on the intersection of biological, psychosocial, and environmental contexts as they apply to diabetes disparities, and how such a framework could inform a translational research agenda to reorient prevention efforts to address these inequalities. Such reorientation is needed to ensure that the implementation of prevention efforts does not inadvertently widen diabetes disparities.","Authors":"Mezuk, B (Mezuk, Briana) ; Concha, JB (Concha, Jeannie B.) ; Perrin, P (Perrin, Paul) ; Green, T (Green, Tiffany)","Title":"COMMENTARY: RECONSIDERING THE ROLE OF CONTEXT IN DIABETES PREVENTION"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000396739400001 PubMed ID: 27897319 ISSN: 0022-5061 eISSN: 1520-6696","Categories":"Social Sciences - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:History Of Social Sciences","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES Volume: 53 Issue: 1 Pages: 5-27 DOI: 10.1002/jhbs.21832 Published: WIN 2017","Abstract":"This article explores the work of psychologist Gordon Gallup, Jr., during the 1960s and 1970s on mirror self-recognition in animals.

In certain situations, the stimulus properties of the mirror changed dramatically, a shift that Gallup thought legitimated the positing of a self-concept. For this reason, Gallup supposed he could use amirror to provide an operationalized concept of the self, that is, produce a definition that was compatible with behaviorist experimental norms.

Toproduce a complete understanding of how law, evolutionary game-theoretic insightsmust, however, supplement these more standard social scientific methods. Toillustrate, this article critically examines The Force of Law by Frederick Schauer and The Expressive Powers of Law by Richard McAdams. Combining the methods of analytic jurisprudence and social psychology, Schauer clarifies the need for a philosophically respectable and empirically well-grounded account of the ubiquity of legal sanctions. Drawing primarily on economic and social psychological paradigms, McAdams highlights law's potential to alter human behavior through expressions that coordinate. Still, these contributions generate further puzzles about how law works, which can be addressed using evolutionary game-theoretic resources. Drawing on these resources, this article argues that legal sanctions are ubiquitous to law not only because they can motivate legal compliance, as Schauer suggests, but also because they provide the general evolutionary stability conditions for intrinsic legal motivation. In reaction to McAdams, this article argues that law's expressive powers can function to coordinate human behavior only because humans are naturally and culturally evolved to share a prior background agreement in forms of life. Evolutionary game-theoretic resources can thus be used to develop a unified framework from within which to understand some of the complex interrelationships between legal sanctions, intrinsic legal motivation, and law's coordinating power. Going forward, interdisciplinary studies of how law works should include greater syntheses of contemporary insights from evolutionary game theory.","Authors":"Kar, RB (Kar, Robin Bradley)","Title":"The Evolutionary Game-Theoretic Foundations of Law"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000392231200007 ISSN: 0747-9360 eISSN: 1531-4790","Keywords":"Affordance; Ecological Psychology; Experience-centered Design; Applied Cognitive Science KeyWords Plus:ECOLOGICAL INTERFACE DESIGN; VISUAL GUIDANCE; INFORMATION; COLLISION; BRAKING","Categories":"Architecture Web of Science Categories:Architecture","Journal Information":"DESIGN ISSUES Volume: 33 Issue: 1 Pages: 76-89 DOI: 10.1162/DESI_a_00427 Published: WIN 2017","Abstract":"As designers and cognitive scientists begin to explore human experience as a relation between people and products, there is a need for constructs that index relational properties (i.e., properties of a product that are dependent on properties of an actor). One such construct that has recently become popular with designers is affordance. Affordances, such as pass-through-able, depend on properties of both an object (e.g., width of an opening) and properties of an actor (e.g., girth or shoulder width). In this article, three relational constructs are suggested to reflect important properties of the coupling between humans and products: affording, specifying, and satisfying. Affording refers to constraints on the action coupling between actor and product. Specifying refers to constraints on the perceptual or informational coupling. Finally, satisfying refers to constraints on value (e.g., attractiveness or desirability). The case is made that each of these three constructs are critical to determining the quality of the experience of an agent with a product (e.g., the capacity for satisfying interactions).","Authors":"Flach, JM (Flach, John M.) ; Stappers, PJ (Stappers, Pieter Jan) ; Voorhorst, FA (Voorhorst, Fred A.)","Title":"Beyond Affordances: Closing the Generalization Gap Between Design and Cognitive Science"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Book Review Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000387882700023 ISSN: 0022-1953 eISSN: 1530-9169","Categories":"History Web of Science Categories:History","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY HISTORY Volume: 47 Issue: 3 Pages: 420-421 Published: WIN 2017","Authors":"Hartnack, C (Hartnack, Christiane)","Title":"Ruling Minds: Psychology in the British Empire"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397321200004 ISSN: 0143-6503 eISSN: 1464-3820","Keywords":"competition law; intellectual property law; economic regulation; consumer sovereignty; psychology; legal theory KeyWords Plus:RESALE PRICE MAINTENANCE; CHOICE; PREFERENCES; QUALITY; TRADE; RATIONALITY; COMPETITION; RESTRAINTS; PROTECTION; ECONOMICS","Categories":"Government & Law Web of Science Categories:Law","Journal Information":"OXFORD JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES Volume: 37 Issue: 1 Pages: 75-104 DOI: 10.1093/ojls/gqw009 Published: SEP 2017","Abstract":"Recent reorientations of the paradigms of 20th-century antitrust law have underscored today's post-scarcity regime, with its focus on uncovering and stamping out behaviour that weakens product manufacturers' incentives to invest in the scarcity, uniqueness and authenticity values that everyday goods and services conjure in consumers' minds. Alongside the general intellectual property law developments that support dilution-avoiding business practices, this article identifies recent case law that underlines the ways in which dilution thinking is surfacing in antitrust law. It evaluates the legal implications of such thinking based on a substantial social science literature that reveals the mechanisms by which marketing strategies that focus on a high price, uniqueness and authenticity do their work. As businesses increasingly employ strategies that seek to condense product information into simple decision-making heuristics that deliberately invoke subconscious appeal to persuade, the normative force of consumer choice is called into question. In order to preserve the ability of consumers to effectively choose between alternatives, an increased promotion of intratype competition presents the greatest likelihood of arresting the sea change initiated by antitrust law's dilution revolution. The reason for this finding, as this article demonstrates, resides in the fact that the economic background-the purchasing context-often determines to a significant extent the manner in which consumers decide and act.","Authors":"Kuenzler, A (Kuenzler, Adrian)","Title":"Dilution Law, Vertical Agreements, and the Construction of Consumption"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397691800029 ISSN: 0736-5853","Keywords":"Social word-of-mouth; Mobile social networking sites; Facebook application; Uses and gratifications; Motivation KeyWords Plus:NETWORKING SITES; VIRTUAL COMMUNITIES; SCALE DEVELOPMENT; INFLUENCE MODEL; ONLINE; INTERNET; DETERMINANTS; ENGAGEMENT; INTENTION; CONSUMERS","Categories":"Information Science & Library Science Web of Science Categories:Information Science & Library Science","Journal Information":"TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS Volume: 34 Issue: 4 Pages: 382-397 DOI: 10.1016/j.tele.2016.08.019 Published: JUL 2017","Abstract":"Media technology may shape consumers' new motivations for disseminating social word-ofmouth (sWOM) via mobile social networking sites (SNSs).

We then highlight areas of organizational research and practice in which big data analytics can have an impact, provide readers with a tempered perspective on big data in the organizational sciences, and suggest a number of ways that researchers, reviewers, and editors can prepare themselves for the introduction of big data research in the organizational sciences.

Organizational pension policies create framing effects that can have intended and unintended consequences depending on how they impact on employees' cognitive processes. Organizational pension communication policy impacts employee pension outcomes through the interaction between fast-acting, automatic System 1 and deliberative, calculating System 2 that typically endorses and occasionally overrides System 1 judgments. System 1 exhibits mental short-cuts (heuristics) and systematic biases. The likelihood of a System 2 challenge to System 1 depends on the persbnal, socio-demographic and economic characteristics of the individuals within the workforce. We propose that those within the HR function, who understand framing effects, can develop pension policies that positively affect pension plan outcomes at the organization level, specifically the pension participation and average contribution rates, using a combination of policies that in some cases promote System 2 endorsement and in other cases, System 2 engagement.

In the present article, we revisit this controversy, identify unresolved issues, and provide a fresh look at the key questions. Our independent replication and extension using a large representative sample of German ninth-grade students (N = 13.648) demonstrates that achievement and intelligence tests are highly but not perfectly correlated. Personality accounts for a substantial share of the variance in achievement but only a small share of that in intelligence. Importantly, personality incrementally explains variance in achievement above and beyond intelligence. Whereas standardized achievement measures are a good (but not \"pure\") indicator of cognitive ability, this problem of confounding is particularly pressing for school grades, which are only modestly correlated with intelligence and highly laden with personality.

In short-term relationships, women are attracted to good genes (e.g., masculinity, attractiveness); in long-term relationships, material traits (e.g., good income, patient) are favoured. A potential predictor of women's mating strategy is sociosexuality, a measure of an individual's willingness to engage in casual, uncommitted sex. We asked whether women high in sociosexuality (i.e., unrestricted sexuality) would demonstrate greater distinctiveness between short- and long-term mate preferences. In. an online study, participants (N = 459) from India and the USA were apportioned a 'mate budget' to construct their ideal short- and long-term partners. Mate Dollars could be spent on either genetic or material traits. As expected, genetic traits were favoured for short-term relationships; material traits were favoured for long-term relationships. However, women with a more restricted sexuality preferred short-term mates who closely resembled their long-term preferences. Women from the USA (with typically less restricted sexuality) showed more distinctive preferences than women from India (with typically more restricted sexuality). Overall, a woman's sociosexuality influences the distinctiveness of her short- and long-term mate preferences. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A path model hypothesized the associations between attachment insecurity (i.e., attachment anxiety and avoidance) and universal-diverse orientation (UDO; i.e., open attitude toward diversity) both directly and indirectly through low self-esteem and interpersonal trust. A structural equation modeling analysis using two samples (N = 338 and 350, respectively) of U.S. undergraduates revealed that attachment anxiety was associated with the UDO cognitive component Relativistic Appreciation positively but its emotional component Comfort with Differences negatively, suggesting ambivalent attitudes to diversity. Indirect effects were significant between attachment insecurity and UDO through trust, although self-esteem was associated with UDO only through its association with trust. It was suggested that mistrust in others' good intention might be why insecurely attached feel uncomfortable with the culturally different people. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A longitudinal study was conducted on the presence/absence of Matthew effect in a sample of 1st to 5th year Primary School children. A total of 51 students who started Primary School in 2011 were evaluated five times by several reading measurement tools: Collective Test of Reading Efficacy (TECLE), PROLEC-R (a battery of tests for the evaluation of reading processes, ACL (a Spanish reading comprehension test), and BEL (a standardised Spanish reading test). Assessment was carried out each June between 2011 and 2015. A group of children (n = 13) considered at risk of being low performance readers (using a percentile criterion below 25 obtained on the TECLE test at the end of the 1st year). A comparison was then made of the progress over 5 years between this group, and a group of average performance readers (n = 26), as well as high-level performance readers (n = 12) from the same sample of participants. Tracking the reader profile of students at risk, helps to determine the changes generated in these children through the different assessments over the five years of the study. The overall results showed differences between the groups assessed, but differences between readers at risk and other groups were not increased. Furthermore, the individual monitoring of students at risk showed that some children improvised his/her performance in reading above the average. Educational suggestions from the study are discussed.

While there is a growing literature regarding the advantages of computer-based data collection, little is known regarding the psychometric comparability of measures across computer-based and traditional paper-and-pencil administration methods. This is especially true with regard to caregiver-report ratings of children's behavioral, academic, and emotional functioning. In this between-subjects study, the psychometric properties of caregiver behavioral, academic, and emotional functioning ratings for youth between the ages of 5 and 18 representing a mixed clinical sample were compared across computer-based (online group; n = 3831) and paper-and-pencil (P&P group; n = 514) administration formats. Groups differed on sex, age, and rater education distributions. Controlling for these variables, no statistically significant differences between groups were found in terms of symptomatology. In terms of psychometric characteristics, no group differences were found on inter-item reliability for any measure, and inter-item reliability for all scales across groups fell within the acceptable range. Similarly, comparisons of factor loadings across groups indicate marked consistency in the psychometric structure of all measures across administration formats. These results suggest that, regardless of administration method, the psychometric properties of caregiver ratings of childrens' behavioral, academic, and emotional functioning remain consistent.

Researchers commonly set experiments to observe human behavior, seeking to increase the degree of engagement of the participants, in order to improve the quality and the amount of results. Digital entertainment artifacts, such as video games, are then used as a viable way of bringing such a high level of engagement. However, psychology researchers usually do not have the knowledge needed to develop digital applications. In addition, as far as we know, no scientific work have tried to describe the impact of using digital entertainment tools in experiments on decision making for resource division. This work aims to report a compilation of discoveries and knowledge learned when designing digital entertainment tools, tailored for scientific experiments on Resources Distribution. The task included interviews with specialists, a questionnaire sent to researchers, the conduction of ideation techniques to generate new concepts and, finally, a set of tools were prototyped and a subset was ultimately developed.

My approach matters because feminist authors critique popular psychology and link it to postfeminism and neoliberalism, but as yet studies have focused on self-help books and magazines and not on newer media. Furthermore, coaching websites are an important medium for circulating postfeminist work femininities and psychological advice, produced through the digital labour of women entrepreneurs.

Consistent with previous research, across three studies utilizing target groups across the ideological spectrum, respondents report more interference (greater urge to make an error) when recalling product preferences for which they disagreed, rather than agreed, with an ingroup majority.

To assess this bias, we measured variations in pupillary dilation as a means of determining attentional arousal in response to neutral, negative and expectancy-violating versions of the same social stimuli: human faces. We conducted three baseline manipulation checks that directly compared neutral faces with threatening (angry) and expectancy-violating (upside-down and Thatcherized) faces, and three bias comparisons that directly compared threatening and expectancy-violating faces with one another. Across these experiments, we found evidence for a dominant expectancy bias in pupillary arousal for social stimuli, whereby expectancy-violating faces produced pupillary dilation earlier than neutral and threatening faces, with Thatcherized faces producing the greatest magnitude of dilation.

Using population-level and experimental data, six studies converge to indicate that infectious disease cues can negatively impact evaluation of secondhand, but not new, products. Studies 1-2 demonstrate that used merchandise retailer revenues are lower in states with elevated pathogen prevalence. Studies 3a-3b echo this relation on an individual level, showing that experimental manipulation of infectious disease threat weakens interest in Used products. Such effects are eliminated when sellers are known to buyers and when buyers engage in a behavior (hand-washing) associated with infection prevention (Studies 4-5). Internal meta-analyses reveal that disease threat consistently decreased used goods preferences and elevated valuation of new products across our experimental studies. This research advances our understanding of how disease avoidance motivation changes reactions to everyday objects, thereby highlighting how infectious disease psychology influences important domains of individual and societal life.

We propose that these self-concepts should define the types of appeals that are most effective at motivating generosity. Across three field studies, we randomly assigned participants to view an appeal for a charitable organization that emphasized agency (the pursuit of personal goals) or communion (the pursuit of shared goals). When the appeal emphasized agency, wealthier individuals reported greater willingness to give and donated more money to charity. In contrast, when the appeal emphasized communion, less wealthy individuals reported greater willingness to give. These findings could not be explained by relevant demographic characteristics such as age, ethnicity, or gender. This work adds to a growing body of research suggesting that wealth does not inherently result in selfishness or generosity.

Here, we report a systematic review of experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience evidence of this distinction in the structure of semantic memory.

This review brings together distinct threads of behavioral, computational, and neuroscience research on semantic memory in support of a functional and neural dissociation, and defines a framework for future studies of semantic memory.","Authors":"Mirman, D (Mirman, Daniel) ; Landrigan, JF (Landrigan, Jon-Frederick) ; Britt, AE (Britt, Allison E.)","Title":"Taxonomic and Thematic Semantic Systems"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395613900002 ISSN: 0148-2963 eISSN: 1873-7978","Keywords":"Asymmetric test; Case research; Core self-evaluation; Job happiness; Job strain; Job stress KeyWords Plus:APPLYING COMPLEXITY THEORY; PET OWNERSHIP; PERSONALITY; PSYCHOLOGY; STRESSORS; HEALTH; CONFIGURATIONS; SERVICES; VALIDITY; DECISION","Categories":"Business & Economics Web of Science Categories:Business","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH Volume: 74 Pages: 11-37 DOI: 10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.01.005 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"This study applies asymmetric rather than conventional symmetric analysis to advance theory in occupational psychology. The study applies systematic case-based analyses to model complex relations among conditions (i.e., configurations of high and low scores for variables) in terms of set memberships of managers. The study uses Boolean algebra to identify configurations (i.e., recipes) reflecting complex conditions sufficient for the occurrence of outcomes of interest (e.g., high versus low financial job stress, job strain, and job satisfaction). The study applies complexity theory tenets to offer a nuanced perspective concerning the occurrence of contrarian cases for example, in identifying different cases (e.g., managers) with high membership scores in a variable (e.g., core self-evaluation) who have low job satisfaction scores and when different cases with low membership scores in the same variable have high job satisfaction. In a large-scale empirical study of managers (n = 928) in four (contextual) segments of the farm industry in New Zealand, this study tests the fit and predictive validities of set membership configurations for simple and complex antecedent conditions that indicate high/low core self evaluations, job stress, and high/low job satisfaction. The findings support the conclusion that complexity theory in combination with configural analysis offers useful insights for explaining nuances in the causes and outcomes to high stress as well as low stress among farm managers. Some findings support and some are contrary to symmetric relationship findings (i.e., highly significant correlations that support main effect hypotheses). The study's findings include evidence supporting the opposite stance to Bart Simpson's (a fictional character in a TV cartoon series) advice that having a cow reflects high stress: dairy farming is an ingredient in farm managers' configurations that reduce stress.

Method: Fifty-five patients with MCI and 57 healthy controls underwent neuropsychological evaluation and a delay discounting questionnaire, which evaluates three parameters: hyperbolic discounting (k), the percentage of choices for delayed and later rewards (%LL), and response consistency (Acc). Results: No significant differences were found in the delay discounting questionnaire between MCI patients and controls for the three reward sizes considered, small, medium, and large, using both k and %LL parameters. There were also no differences in the response consistency, Acc, between the two groups. Conclusions: Patients with MCI perform similarly to healthy controls in a delay discounting task.

In Study 1, participants were subliminally exposed to sexual stimuli (vs. neutral stimuli), and then disclosed over Instant Messenger a personal event to an opposite-sex stranger. Results showed that merely thinking about sex, even without being aware of it, encouraged self-disclosure. Study 2 replicated these findings in relatively naturalistic conditions (live face-to-face interactions following supraliminal video priming). Study 3 extended these findings, indicating that sexual priming facilitated self-disclosure, which, in turn, increased interest in future interactions with the stranger. Together, these findings suggest that activation of the sexual system encourages the use of strategies that allow people to become closer to potential partners.","Authors":"Birnbaum, GE (Birnbaum, Gurit E.) ; Mizrahi, M (Mizrahi, Moran) ; Kaplan, A (Kaplan, Ayelet) ; Kadosh, D (Kadosh, Danielle) ; Kariv, D (Kariv, Dana) ; Tabib, D (Tabib, Danielle) ; Ziv, D (Ziv, Daniella) ; Sadeh, L (Sadeh, Lihi) ; Burban, D (Burban, Daniella)","Title":"Sex Unleashes Your Tongue: Sexual Priming Motivates Self-Disclosure to a New Acquaintance and Interest in Future Interactions"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398674400011 ISSN: 0146-1672 eISSN: 1552-7433","Keywords":"emotion regulation; social support; perspective taking; social interaction KeyWords Plus:SOCIAL REGULATION; SUPPORT; ADJUSTMENT; PSYCHOLOGY; SCIENCE; MODELS; HEALTH","Categories":"Psychology Web of Science Categories:Psychology, Social","Journal Information":"PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY BULLETIN Volume: 43 Issue: 5 Pages: 729-739 DOI: 10.1177/0146167217695558 Published: MAY 2017","Abstract":"Although much research considers how individuals manage their own emotions, less is known about the emotional benefits of regulating the emotions of others.

Moreover, social regulation messages with more other-focused language (i. e., second-person pronouns) were (a) more likely to elicit expressions of gratitude from recipients and (b) predictive of increased use of reappraisal over time for message composers, suggesting perspective-taking enhances the benefits of practicing social regulation.

However, vegetarian identities are diverse, multidimensional, and unique to each individual. Much research has identified fundamental psychological aspects of vegetarianism, and an identity framework that unifies these findings into common constructs and conceptually defines variables is needed. Integrating psychological theories of identity with research on food choices and vegetarianism, this paper proposes a conceptual model for studying vegetarianism: The Unified Model of Vegetarian Identity (UMVI). The UMVI encompasses ten dimensions organized into three levels (contextual, internalized, and externalized) that capture the role of vegetarianism in an individual's self-concept. Contextual dimensions situate vegetarianism within contexts; internalized dimensions outline self-evaluations; and externalized dimensions describe enactments of identity through behavior. Together, these dimensions form a coherent vegetarian identity, characterizing one's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors regarding being vegetarian. By unifying dimensions that capture psychological constructs universally, the UMVI can prevent discrepancies in operationalization, capture the inherent diversity of vegetarian identities, and enable future research to generate greater insight into how people understand themselves and their food choices.

However, the required normal distribution of the random effects can often be violated by the presence of clusters among subjects, which leads to multi-modal distributions. In such cases, using what is known as mixture regression models might offer a more appropriate approach. These models are widely used in psychology, sociology, and medicine to describe the diversity of trajectories occurring within a population over time (e.g. psychological development, growth). In ecology and evolution, however, these models are seldom used even though understanding changes in individual trajectories is an active area of research in life-history studies. Our aim is to demonstrate the value of using mixture models to describe variation in individual life-history tactics within a population, and hence to promote the use of these models by ecologists and evolutionary ecologists. We first ran a set of simulations to determine whether and when a mixture model allows teasing apart latent clustering, and to contrast the precision and accuracy of estimates obtained from mixture models versus mixed models under a wide range of ecological contexts. We then used empirical data from long-term studies of large mammals to illustrate the potential of using mixture models for assessing within-population variation in life-history tactics. Mixture models performed well in most cases, except for variables following a Bernoulli distribution and when sample size was small. The four selection criteria we evaluated [Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and two bootstrap methods] performed similarly well, selecting the right number of clusters in most ecological situations. We then showed that the normality of random effects implicitly assumed by evolutionary ecologists when using mixed models was often violated in life-history data. Mixed models were quite robust to this violation in the sense that fixed effects were unbiased at the population level. However, fixed effects at the cluster level and random effects were better estimated using mixture models. Our empirical analyses demonstrated that using mixture models facilitates the identification of the diversity of growth and reproductive tactics occurring within a population. Therefore, using this modelling framework allows testing for the presence of clusters and, when clusters occur, provides reliable estimates of fixed and random effects for each cluster of the population. In the presence or expectation of clusters, using mixture models offers a suitable extension of mixed models, particularly when evolutionary ecologists aim at identifying how ecological and evolutionary processes change within a population. Mixture regression models therefore provide a valuable addition to the statistical toolbox of evolutionary ecologists. As these models are complex and have their own limitations, we provide recommendations to guide future users.","Authors":"Hamel, S (Hamel, Sandra) ; Yoccoz, NG (Yoccoz, Nigel G.) ; Gaillard, JM (Gaillard, Jean-Michel)","Title":"Assessing variation in life-history tactics within a population using mixture regression models: a practical guide for evolutionary ecologists"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397361700013 ISSN: 0191-8869","Keywords":"Alexithymia; Interpersonal circumplex; Attachment KeyWords Plus:ADULT-ATTACHMENT; EMOTION REGULATION; VALIDITY EVIDENCE; SELF; CIRCUMPLEX; SCALE; REPRESENTATIONS; QUESTIONNAIRE; DISCRIMINANT; EXPERIENCES","Categories":"Psychology Web of Science Categories:Psychology, Social","Journal Information":"PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES Volume: 110 Pages: 65-69 DOI: 10.1016/j.paid.2017.01.027 Published: MAY 1 2017","Abstract":"Alexithymia refers to the difficulty identifying and describing emotions as well as an externally-oriented cognitive style. The interpersonal theory of clinical, social, and personality psychology is a well-articulated conceptual framework from which to examine this construct. In three separate samples from two geographic regions in the United States, university students completed self-report measures of interpersonal style, interpersonal goals, attachment, and interpersonal outcomes. The three components of alexithymia (i.e., difficulty identifying emotions; difficulty describing emotions; externally-oriented thinking) were associated with a hostile interpersonal style and hostile interpersonal goals. Attachment insecurity to romantic partners and to a higher power (e.g., God) was a consistent finding for those participants reporting difficulty identifying and difficulty describing their emotional experiences. Overall, these components were also associated with deleterious interpersonal outcomes, but the externally-oriented thinking component demonstrated inconsistent and weaker associations. It is argued that interpersonal theory can play an important role as an integrative framework for understanding the construct of alexithymia. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Firstly, our recent proposed feature, Self-Similarity of Gradients (GSS), is employed to detect smiling facial images in unconstrained scenarios. Secondly, the smile intensity is estimated in terms of different facial regions rather than merely the mouth region, which is also applied in the temporal phase segmentation of a smile. Finally, in SVP smile recognition module, a discriminative learning model (DLM) is proposed based on a local spatial-temporal feature, which devotes to obtaining most robust and discrihainative patterns of interest. The first two modules are the bases of the last, preparing a deeper understanding of a smile. Experiments on benchmark databases are carried out and compared with the state-of-the-art methods respectively, which validate the advantages of our approach of SVP smile recognition.

However, as the more educated cohort gets older they care less about homogamy while less educated daters become more interested in homogamy which leads to an increase in similarity towards caring for the same educational level. On the other hand, older and more educated online daters are less likely to contact those with lower educational levels compared to their own while women are more likely to contact a potential mate with higher educational levels relative to their own (hypergamy).

Simple regression/correlation is often applied to non-independent observations or aggregated data; this may produce biased, specious results due to violation of independence and/or differing patterns between-participants versus within-participants. Unlike simple regression/correlation, rmcorr does not violate the assumption of independence of observations. Also, rmcorr tends to have much greater statistical power because neither averaging nor aggregation is necessary for an intra-individual research question. Rmcorr estimates the common regression slope, the association shared among individuals. To make rmcorr accessible, we provide background information for its assumptions and equations, visualization, power, and tradeoffs with rmcorr compared to multilevel modeling. We introduce the R package (rmcorr) and demonstrate its use for inferential statistics and visualization with two example datasets.

Spanning decades of research activity, the scholarly literature on CSR has been dominated by meso-and macro-level perspectives, such as studies within corporate strategy that examine relationships between firm-level indicators of social/environmental performance and corporate financial performance. In recent years, however, there has been an explosion of micro-oriented CSR research conducted at the individual level of analysis, especially with respect to studies on how and why job seekers and employees perceive and react to CSR practices. This micro-level focus is reflected in 12 articles published as a Research Topic collection in Frontiers in Psychology (Organizational Psychology Specialty Section) titled \"CSR and organizational psychology: Quid pro quo.\" In the present article, the authors summarize and integrate findings from these Research Topic articles. After describing some of the \"new frontiers\" these articles explore and create, the authors strive to fulfill a \"quid pro quo\" with some of the meso-and macro-oriented CSR literatures that paved the way for micro-CSR research. Specifically, the authors draw on insights from the Research Topic articles to inform a multilevel model that offers multiple illustrations of how micro-level processes among individual stakeholders can explain variability in meso (firm)-level relationships between CSR practices and corporate performance.

The current research explored how older workers, vis-a-vis younger workers, react to perceptions of fairness. Integrating socioemotional selectivity theory and the multiple needs theory of organizational justice, we generated novel predictions regarding the relations between perceptions of workplace justice, emotional exhaustion, and employee deviance. Specifically, we hypothesized and found that employee age moderates the negative relation between justice facets and deviance (Study 1) and emotional exhaustion (Study 2). We also found that emotional exhaustion mediates the differential effects of justice on deviance, and that this relation depends on employee age (Study 2). Relative to younger workers, older workers are more sensitive to informational and interpersonal justice; in contrast, relative to older workers, younger workers are more sensitive to distributive and procedural justice. The research supports and extends existing theory on organizational justice and on the psychology of aging.

Data from several rat strains/lines strongly suggest that catalase-mediated brain oxidation of ethanol into acetaldehyde is an absolute requirement (up 80%-95%) for rats to display ethanol's reinforcing effects and to initiate chronic ethanol intake. Acetaldehyde binds non-enzymatically to dopamine forming salsolinol, a compound that is selfadministered. In UChB rats, salsolinol: (a) generates marked sensitization to the motivational effects of ethanol; and (b) strongly promotes binge-like drinking. The specificity of salsolinol actions is shown by the finding that only the R-salsolinol enantiomer but not S-salsolinol accounted for the latter effects. Inhibition of brain acetaldehyde synthesis does not influence the maintenance of chronic ethanol intake. However, a prolonged ethanol withdrawal partly returns the requirement for acetaldehyde synthesis/levels both on chronic ethanol intake and on alcohol relapse-like drinking. Chronic ethanol intake, involving the action of lipopolysaccharide diffusing from the gut, and likely oxygen radical generated upon catechol/salsolinol oxidation, leads to oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation, known to potentiate each other. Data show that the administration of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) a strong antioxidant inhibits chronic ethanol maintenance by 60%-70%, without inhibiting its initial intake. Intra-cerebroventricular administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), known to release anti-inflammatory cytokines, to elevate superoxide dismutase levels and to reverse ethanol-induced hippocampal injury and cognitive deficits, also inhibited chronic ethanol maintenance; further, relapse-like ethanol drinking was inhibited up to 85% for 40 days following intracerebral stem cell administration. Thus: (i) ethanol must be metabolized intracerebrally into acetaldehyde, and further into salsolinol, which appear responsible for promoting the acquisition of the early reinforcing effects of ethanol; (ii) acetaldehyde is not responsible for the maintenance of chronic ethanol intake, while other mechanisms are indicated; (iii) the systemic administration of NAC, a strong antioxidant markedly inhibits the maintenance of chronic ethanol intake; and (iv) the intra-cerebroventricular administration of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant MSCs inhibit both the maintenance of chronic ethanol intake and relapse-like drinking.","Authors":"Israel, Y (Israel, Yedy) ; Karahanian, E (Karahanian, Eduardo) ; Ezquer, F (Ezquer, Fernando) ; Morales, P (Morales, Paola) ; Ezquer, M (Ezquer, Marcelo) ; Rivera-Meza, M (Rivera-Meza, Mario) ; Herrera-Marschitz, M (Herrera-Marschitz, Mario) ; Quintanilla, ME (Quintanilla, Maria E.)","Title":"Acquisition, Maintenance and Relapse-Like Alcohol Drinking: Lessons from the UChB Rat Line"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398175600001 ISSN: 1664-1078","Keywords":"implicit learning; conscious awareness; fluency; associative strength; serial reaction time task; unexpected events KeyWords Plus:CONSCIOUS PERCEPTION; IMPLICIT; AWARENESS; NEUROSCIENCE; ATTENTION; DISSOCIATION; PERFORMANCE; EXPRESSION; PSYCHOLOGY; SEQUENCES","Categories":"Psychology Web of Science Categories:Psychology, Multidisciplinary","Journal Information":"FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY Volume: 8 DOI: 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00502 Published: APR 4 2017","Abstract":"The Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT) is an important paradigm to study the properties of unconscious learning processes. One specifically interestingand still controversially discussed topic are the conditions under which unconsciously acquired knowledge becomes conscious knowledge. The different assumptions about the underlying mechanisms can contrastively be separated into two accounts: single system views in which the strengthening of associative weights throughout training gradually turns implicit knowledge into explicit knowledge, and dual system views in which implicit knowledge itself does not become conscious. Rather, it requires a second process which detects changes in performance and is able to acquire conscious knowledge. In a series of three experiments, we manipulated the arrangement of sequential and deviant trials. In an SRTT training, participants either received mini-blocks of sequential trials followed by mini-blocks of deviant trials (22 trials each) or they received sequential and deviant trials mixed randomly. Importantly the number of correct and deviant transitions was the same for both conditions. Experiment 1 showed that both conditions acquired a comparable amount of implicit knowledge, expressed indifferent test tasks.Experiment 2 further demonstrated that both conditions differed in their subjectively experienced fluency of the task, with more fluency experienced when trained with mini-blocks. Lastly, Experiment 3 revealed that the articipants trained with longer mini-blocks of sequential and deviant material developed more explicit knowledge.

A two-dimensional (2D) approach to the assessment of emotion (the valence-arousal plane) with frontal alpha power asymmetry EEG (as a proposed index of valence) validated our visual music as an emotional stimulus. In Experiment 2, we used our synthetic stimuli to investigate possible underlying mechanisms of affective evaluation mechanisms in relation to audio and visual integration conditions betweenmodalities (namely congruent, complementation, or incongruent combinations). In this experiment, we found that, when arousal information between auditory and visual modalities was contradictory [for example, active (+) on the audio channel but passive (-) on the video channel], the perceived emotion of cross-modal perception (visual music) followed the channel conveying the stronger arousal. Moreover, we found that an enhancement effect (heightened and compacted in subjects' emotional responses) in the aesthetic perception of visual music might occur when the two channels contained contradictory arousal information and positive congruency in valence and texture/control.

This article describes (1) the adaptation of a shorter version of the Evidence-based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS-50 items), and (2) the psychometric properties of the shortened version in both US and Norwegian data. Methods: The US participants were mental health service providers (N = 418) recruited from clinics providing mental health services in San Diego County, California. The Norwegian participants were psychologists, psychiatric nurses, and psychology students (N = 838) recruited from the Norwegian Psychological Association and the Norwegian Nurses Organization. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach was used. Results: The reduction resulted in 36 items named EBPAS-36, and the original 12 factor model was maintained. The EBPAS-36 had acceptable model fit, as indicated by a low degree of misspecification errors in both the US (RMSEA =.045 (CI90%.040-. 049); SRMR =.05) and the Norwegian data (RMSEA =.052 (CI90%.047-. 056, SRMR =.07).

Yet it remains difficult to isolate the effect of self-construal in a comparative approach. Therefore, we used priming methodology in three studies to induce either an independent or interdependent mindset to test direct consequences on fairness considerations. Specifically, we asked whether participants would accept an unfair ultimatum game offer: a split of 10 euros, where the participant is allocated the marginal share of 3 and the proposer 7. If the participant refuses, neither gets paid. In the first study, we used the well-known similarities and differences prime. Here, activating an interdependent mindset decreased rejection of the unfair offer compared to the independent mindset and control condition, but only in females. The prime did not affect males. In the second and third study we modified our university's mission statement to instead include either independent or interdependent values. Females displayed a similar direction of effects; in males however, activating an interdependent mindset increased rejection. Taken together, the results show that whether participants accept or reject an unfair offer depends on both their gender and the self-construal prime. The results were interpreted using the distinction between relational independence that has been associated with females, and collective interdependence, that has been associated with males. Possible consequences for future studies are discussed.","Authors":"Flinkenfloger, N (Flinkenfloger, Nic) ; Novin, S (Novin, Sheida) ; Huizinga, M (Huizinga, Marlette) ; Krabbendam, L (Krabbendam, Lydia)","Title":"Gender Moderates the Influence of Self-Construal Priming on Fairness Considerations"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398164600001 PubMed ID: 28421012 ISSN: 1664-1078","Keywords":"youth mental health; early psychosis; psychosocial treatment; family intervention; online treatment; psychoeducation; online social networking KeyWords Plus:1ST EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; FAMILY PSYCHOEDUCATION; OUTCOMES; SUPPORT; IMPACT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; INTERVENTIONS; SERVICES; DEPRESSION","Categories":"Psychology Web of Science Categories:Psychology, Multidisciplinary","Journal Information":"FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY Volume: 8 Article Number: 485 DOI: 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00485 Published: APR 3 2017","Abstract":"Family members caring for a young person diagnosed with the onset of mental health problems face heightened stress, depression, and social isolation.

Individual children differ substantially in the pace at which their EFs develop, and characteristics such as sex and the level of parental education (LPE) are thought to contribute to these differences. In the present study, we assessed age-related changes in EFs as perceived and evaluated by teachers and parents as well as the influence of sex and LPE on their evaluations. We used a newly developed observer-report questionnaire, the Amsterdam Executive Function Inventory (AEFI). The AEFI assesses three important components of the executive aspects of daily life behavior in 13 questions: Attention; Self-control and Self-monitoring; and Planning and Initiative taking. Teachers and parents evaluated these aspects of executive functioning in 186 schoolchildren in grades 3-6 (age: 9-12 years). Age effects within grades and differences in social economic status between the four participating schools were controlled. Results showed a significant increase in teacher-perceived EFs from third to fourth grades and from fifth to sixth grades. This development was influenced both by the sex of the child and by the LPE. As perceived by teachers, the component self-control and self-monitoring was higher for girls than for boys, and planning abilities were higher for children from families with a higher LPE. Additional analyses showed that there is a systematic and statistically significant difference between the evaluations of the teachers and that of parents. Parents reported higher scores for planning, whereas teachers reported higher scores for self-control and self-monitoring. Evaluations by parents and teachers were different for girls, but not for boys. These findings are important because they imply that the development of EFs as perceived by parents and teachers is influenced by child-related factors. Second, there are clear differences in evaluations between teachers and parents. The AEFI appears to be a tool that is easily used by parents and teachers and shows potential for monitoring the development of EFs as perceived by significant others during young adolescence.","Authors":"van Tetering, MAJ (van Tetering, Marleen A.

A total of 97 members of centres for older adults located in Rome, Italy participated in a screening using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test. Prior to testing, a group of volunteers had organised a performance focused on events from the distant past, stimulating intergenerational reminiscence. The participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the first case, prior to administering the test, a psychotherapist talked to each participant about the performance, focusing on ageing and stressing the neutral aspects of its social representations, such as change and time. In the second case, performance was used to concentrate on positive aspects of the social representations of ageing, namely wisdom and experience. In line with the hypothesis, focusing on positive aspects of social representations of ageing (wisdom and experience) versus their neutral aspects (change and time) has resulted in improved performance on a standardised memory test.

In the present studies, we tested a hypothesis that not only explains why women exhibit increased trust in gay men but also yields novel predictions about when (i.e., in what contexts) this phenomenon is likely to occur. Specifically, we propose that gay men's lack of motives to mate with women or to compete with them for mates enhances women's trust in gay men and openness to befriend them. Study 1 demonstrated that women placed greater trust in a gay man's mating but not non-mating (e.g., career) advice than in the same advice given by heterosexual individuals. Study 2 showed that women perceived a gay man to be more sincere in scenarios relevant to sexual and competitive mating deception. In Study 3, exposing women to a visualization of increased mating competition enhanced their trust in gay men; when mating competition was salient, women's trust in mating information from a gay man was amplified.

The transtheoretical molecular model, as articulated by Gonsalvez and Calvert (2014), offers a structure for advancing competency-based supervision and an important contribution, providing for definition of content and processes implicit in supervision practice. Barriers to implementation of competency-based supervision include lack of consensus on effective supervision practices, lack of empirical support for the model, and an absence of systematic training in clinical supervision during the training trajectory. However, the competency-based model, when implemented with fidelity to an explicit approach with designated competencies (Falender & Shafranske, 2017; Gonsalvez & Calvert, 2014) provides essential components for implementation. These include supervisee and supervisor self-assessment of competence as a platform for goal setting, establishment of a collaborative supervisory relationship through this process, attention to the power differential implicit in the relationship, with a promise of transparency in feedback provided through competence assessment and monitoring, attention to diversity and multicultural personal factors, and ethical, legal, and regulatory factors. The process of supervision enhances the supervisee's metacompetence, or awareness of what he/she knows and does not know, and skill development through systematic targeted monitoring and feedback. However, significant tensions arise in balancing multiple supervisor roles and responsibilities involving multicultural and global competence. Steps are proposed to advance supervisor competence within competency-based supervision and the requisite practices are identified that define it as a model for future study and empirical analysis of supervision efficacy.","Authors":"Falender, CA (Falender, Carol A.) ; Shafranske, EP (Shafranske, Edward P.)","Title":"Competency-based Clinical Supervision: Status, Opportunities, Tensions, and the Future"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397561000003 ISSN: 0005-0067 eISSN: 1742-9544","Keywords":"competency scales; measurement of competencies; professional supervision; psychometric properties; supervision effectiveness; supervision evaluation; supervisory competence KeyWords Plus:CLINICAL SUPERVISION; PSYCHOLOGY; MODEL; QUESTIONNAIRE; INVENTORY; TRAINEES; ALLIANCE; OUTCOMES","Categories":"Psychology Web of Science Categories:Psychology, Multidisciplinary","Journal Information":"AUSTRALIAN PSYCHOLOGIST Volume: 52 Issue: 2 Pages: 94-103 DOI: 10.1111/ap.12269 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"ObjectivesThe last two decades has witnessed a strong endorsement of competency-based models for both practitioner training and professional supervision. The valid and reliable measurement of supervisee and supervisory competence is an essential step towards progress, yet currently there are few instruments that can claim to measure the range of supervisor competencies. The current study establishes the Supervision Evaluation and Supervisory Competence (SE-SC) scale as a new, psychometrically sound instrument. MethodA total of 142 supervisees anonymously completed overall evaluations of supervision satisfaction and supervisor effectiveness and of specific supervisor competencies using the SE-SC instrument. The specific competencies were subjected to a hierarchical cluster analyses to determine the underlying structure of supervisory competence. ResultsThe results supported a six-cluster solution that included (a) Openness, caring and support, (b) Supervisor's Knowledge and Expertise as Therapist, (c) Supervision Planning and Management, (d) Goal-Directed Supervision, (e) Restorative Competencies, and (f) Insight into and Management of Therapist-Client Dynamics and Reflective Practitioner Competencies. The results yielded excellent internal reliability, test-retest reliability, and concurrent validity for the six clusters, with high and meaningful correlations with subscales of the Supervisory Working Alliance Inventory (SWAI) and the Supervisory Styles Inventory (SSI). More importantly, the six clusters together better predicted overall scores on supervision satisfaction and effectiveness (85% of variance) than did subscales of the SWAI (56%) and the SSI (57%). ConclusionThe SE-SC demonstrates good psychometric properties and is a useful scale to measure a supervisee's evaluation of supervisory competence.","Authors":"Gonsalvez, CJ (Gonsalvez, Craig J.) ; Hamid, G (Hamid, Geaty) ; Savage, NM (Savage, Nicole M.) ; Livni, D (Livni, Danielle)","Title":"The Supervision Evaluation and Supervisory Competence Scale: Psychometric Validation"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397561000005 ISSN: 0005-0067 eISSN: 1742-9544","Keywords":"assessment; outcomes; student competency; supervision; training KeyWords Plus:CLINICAL SUPERVISION; WORKING ALLIANCE; COMPETENCE; SATISFACTION; EDUCATION","Categories":"Psychology Web of Science Categories:Psychology, Multidisciplinary","Journal Information":"AUSTRALIAN PSYCHOLOGIST Volume: 52 Issue: 2 Pages: 114-120 DOI: 10.1111/ap.12258 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"ObjectivePsychological assessment is a key activity for psychologists and a foundational element of psychology training, and psychological assessment supervision differs from psychotherapy supervision. The present study investigated factors that promote effectiveness in psychological assessment supervision. MethodParticipants were 47 assessment practica students at a clinical psychology doctoral program in the USA, their supervisors, and faculty evaluators of the Clinical Qualifying Exam-Assessment (CQE-A), which was the student competency outcome measure. Students were grouped by CQE-A performance: pass (n = 15), remediate (n = 23), and fail (n = 9). ResultsSuccessful students performed better on tasks that required them to integrate complex client information, reported more supplemental supervision experiences, such as in group or provided by unlicensed advanced trainees, and indicated that supplemental experiences were associated with greater confidence. Successful students were rated as more able to manage anxiety during the CQE-A and to use practicum supervision effectively. Students who failed reported greater focus in supervision on basic skills, and demonstrated inaccuracy in skills self-assessment. Student satisfaction was positively correlated with regular monitoring, ongoing feedback, clear goals and expectations, clear evaluation criteria, an initial baseline skills assessment, regular meetings, and supervisors staying updated. ConclusionsLinking skills assessment, goal setting, and evaluation are important for successful student outcomes. A developmental approach may aid in customizing supervision. Tools, such as supervision agreements and training to orient students to the process of assessment supervision, may impact student ability to use supervision effectively.

Questions addressed approaches to monitoring progress on placements, identification and management of trainees determined to be underperforming on placements, and the perceived usefulness of a range of strategies such as the use of standardised-rating tools. ResultsThirty one responses were received, representing 40 clinical psychology training courses in 22 institutions across Australia and New Zealand. In all cases, at least one trainee with a PPC had been detected in the previous 5 years, most commonly attributed to psychological, behavioural, and developmental issues.

The commonly used Clinical Psychology Practicum Competencies Rating Scale (CPRS) has been shown to elicit inflated ratings of competency. Hence, the aim of this study is to examine whether brief supervisor training reduces ratings by providing objective criteria with which supervisors can assess trainee competency. MethodThe ratings included were of 124 psychology trainees from nine Australian university clinical programmes. Of 170 supervisors, 32 completed the online training immediately prior to commencing the CPRS. Training required supervisors to rate the competency level described in five standardised vignettes (Beginner through to Competent). Vignette ratings, as determined by a panel of expert supervisors, were provided as feedback. A sixth calibration vignette was also rated (no feedback provided). Firstly, CPRS ratings from the trained and untrained supervisors were compared. Secondly, the difference between supervisor and expert ratings of the calibration vignettes were compared across trained and untrained groups. ResultsTrained supervisors provided lower CPRS ratings than untrained supervisors. In addition, trained supervisors (vs untrained supervisors) provided ratings of the calibration vignette that more accurately matched the ratings provided by the expert panel. ConclusionsBrief online training using standardised vignettes was associated with lower CPRS ratings. The standardised vignettes helped calibrate supervisors' ratings and likely attuned supervisors to the skills and competency levels that are expected at particular developmental stages. As a consequence, training appeared to reduce ratings, arguably resulting in more accurate assessments of trainee performance.","Authors":"Terry, J (Terry, Josephine) ; Gonsalvez, C (Gonsalvez, Craig) ; Deane, FP (Deane, Frank Patrick)","Title":"Brief Online Training with Standardised Vignettes Reduces Inflated Supervisor Ratings of Trainee Practitioner Competencies"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397561000008 ISSN: 0005-0067 eISSN: 1742-9544","Keywords":"barriers; clinical psychology; field placement; practicum; student placement; supervision KeyWords Plus:COMPETENCE; MODEL","Categories":"Psychology Web of Science Categories:Psychology, Multidisciplinary","Journal Information":"AUSTRALIAN PSYCHOLOGIST Volume: 52 Issue: 2 Pages: 140-148 DOI: 10.1111/ap.12254 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"ObjectiveWith increasing focus on the treatment of mental health problems the need for clinical psychologists is expanding, driving strong demand for postgraduate clinical psychology training programs. Although the number of training places in Australia has increased, the availability of external placements appears to have lagged behind, causing significant challenges to students.

MethodA survey was developed in order to identify potential student placement capacity and factors that may prevent potential supervisors from offering placements to students. The survey was distributed electronically through clinical psychology networks targeting those employed in NSW. ResultsOne hundred and forty endorsed clinical psychologists completed the survey. Of these, 42% stated they felt unable to offer field placements to students within the next 12 months. The most commonly cited barriers to offering a placement included a lack of time (21%); not being a PsyBA supervisor (18%); being employed part-time (18%) and the concern that clinical supervision time did not attract funding under the current public health funding model (16%). ConclusionThe study provides an estimate of clinical field placement capacity in NSW. The results suggest that the capacity in the existing clinical psychology workforce could meet clinical field placement demand. The authors discuss reasons why anecdotally, this does not appear to reflect the reality of field placement coordinators and students.

Comfort and willingness to utilise new supervision technologies was also assessed. ResultsResults reveal a perceived lack of understanding of electronic security mechanisms. Comparisons of perceived risk between physical and equivalent digitally managed information were rated as similar. Psychologists tend to engage in higher perceived risk behaviours less often, although there are some clear discrepancies.

Positive psychology interventions, which target psychological wellbeing, may represent a promising approach to improving health behaviors in high-risk cardiac patients. However, no study has assessed whether a positive psychology intervention can promote physical activity following an acute coronary syndrome. Objective: In this article we will describe the methods of a novel factorial design study to aid the development of a positive psychology-based intervention for acute coronary syndrome patients and aim to provide preliminary feasibility data on study implementation. Methods: The Positive Emotions after Acute Coronary Events III study is an optimization study (planned N = 128), subsumed within a larger multiphase optimization strategy iterative treatment development project. The goal of Positive Emotions after Acute Coronary Events III is to identify the ideal components of a positive psychology-based intervention to improve post-acute coronary syndrome physical activity. Using a 2 3 2 3 2 factorial design, Positive Emotions after Acute Coronary Events III aims to: (1) evaluate the relative merits of using positive psychology exercises alone or combined with motivational interviewing, (2) assess whether weekly or daily positive psychology exercise completion is optimal, and (3) determine the utility of booster sessions. The study's primary outcome measure is moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at 16 weeks, measured via accelerometer. Secondary outcome measures include psychological, functional, and adherence-related behavioral outcomes, along with metrics of feasibility and acceptability. For the primary study outcome, we will use a mixed-effects model with a random intercept (to account for repeated measures) to assess the main effects of each component (inclusion of motivational interviewing in the exercises, duration of the intervention, and inclusion of booster sessions) from a full factorial model controlling for baseline activity. Similar analyses will be performed on self-report measures and objectively-measured medication adherence over 16 weeks. We hypothesize that the combined positive psychology and motivational interviewing intervention, weekly exercises, and booster sessions will be associated with superior physical activity. Results: Thus far, 78 participants have enrolled, with 72% of all possible exercises fully completed by participants. Conclusion: The Positive Emotions after Acute Coronary Events III study will help to determine the optimal content, intensity, and duration of a positive psychology intervention in post-acute coronary syndrome patients prior to testing in a randomized trial. This study is novel in its use of a factorial design within the multiphase optimization strategy framework to optimize a behavioral intervention and the use of a positive psychology intervention to promote physical activity in high-risk cardiac patients.","Authors":"Huffman, JC (Huffman, Jeffery C.) ; Albanese, AM (Albanese, Ariana M.) ; Campbell, KA (Campbell, Kirsti A.) ; Celano, CM (Celano, Christopher M.) ; Millstein, RA (Millstein, Rachel A.) ; Mastromauro, CA (Mastromauro, Carol A.) ; Healy, BC (Healy, Brian C.) ; Chung, WJ (Chung, Wei-Jean) ; Januzzi, JL (Januzzi, James L.) ; Collins, LM (Collins, Linda M.) ; Park, ER (Park, Elyse R.) ...More...Less","Title":"The Positive Emotions after Acute Coronary Events behavioral health intervention: Design, rationale, and preliminary feasibility of a factorial design study"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Editorial Material Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397689400013 PubMed ID: 27642031 ISSN: 0010-0277 eISSN: 1873-7838","Keywords":"Uncanny valley; Stranger avoidance; Categorization difficulty; Appearance KeyWords Plus:DEVALUATION; INHIBITION; DIFFICULTY; RESPONSES; EERINESS; FACES","Categories":"Psychology Web of Science Categories:Psychology, Experimental","Journal Information":"COGNITION Volume: 161 Pages: 129-131 DOI: 10.1016/j.cognition.2016.09.001 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Artificial objects often subjectively look eerie when their appearance to some extent resembles a human, which is known as the uncanny valley phenomenon.

The purpose of the current study was to examine the use of an ALS-specific mindfulness-based intervention for improving quality of life in this population. Methods: A randomized, open-label and controlled clinical trial was conducted on the efficacy of an ALS-specific meditation programme in promoting quality of life. Adults who received a diagnosis of ALS within 18 months were randomly assigned either to usual care or to an 8-week meditation training based on the original mindfulness-based stress reduction programme and tailored for people with ALS. Quality of life, assessed with the ALS-Specific Quality of Life Revised scale, represented the primary outcome, whilst secondary outcomes included anxiety and depression, assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and specific quality of life domains. Participants were assessed at recruitment and after 2, 6 and 12 months. The efficacy of the treatment was assessed on an intention-to-treat basis of a linear mixed model. Results: A hundred participants were recruited between November 2012 and December 2014. Over time, there was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of quality of life (beta = 0.24, P = 0.015, d = 0.89). Significant differences between groups over time were also found for anxiety, depression, negative emotions, and interaction with people and the environment.

In animal communication, complex signals may evolve from simpler signals because novel signal elements exploit preexisting biases in receivers' sensory systems. Investigating the shape of female preference functions for novel signal characteristics is a powerful, but underutilized, method to describe the adaptive landscape potentially guiding complex signal evolution. We measured female preference functions for characteristics of acoustic appendages added to male calling songs in the grasshopper Chorthippus biguttulus, which naturally produces only simple songs. We discovered both hidden preferences for and biases against novel complex songs, and identified rules governing song attractiveness based on multiple characteristics of both the base song and appendage. The appendage's temporal position and duration were especially important: long appendages preceding the song often made songs less attractive, while following appendages were neutral or weakly attractive. Appendages had stronger effects on songs of shorter duration, but did not restore the attractiveness of very unattractive songs. We conclude that sensory biases favor, within predictable limits, the evolution of complex songs in grasshoppers. The function-valued approach is an important tool in determining the generality of these limits in other taxa and signaling modalities.","Authors":"Reichert, MS (Reichert, Michael S.) ; Finck, J (Finck, Jonas) ; Ronacher, B (Ronacher, Bernhard)","Title":"Exploring the hidden landscape of female preferences for complex signals"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398043800008 ISSN: 0015-704X","Categories":"Government & Law Web of Science Categories:Law","Journal Information":"FORDHAM LAW REVIEW Volume: 85 Issue: 5 Pages: 2081-2095 Published: APR 2017","Authors":"Hollander-Blumoff, R (Hollander-Blumoff, Rebecca)","Title":"FAIRNESS BEYOND THE ADVERSARY SYSTEM: PROCEDURAL JUSTICE NORMS FOR LEGAL NEGOTIATION"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Editorial Material Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398058300001 ISSN: 1059-6011 eISSN: 1552-3993","Keywords":"human side; collaborative partnerships; psychological microfoundations; mergers and acquisitions; M&A; strategic alliances; joint ventures; JV KeyWords Plus:ORGANIZATIONAL-BEHAVIOR; POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY; GRAND CHALLENGES; JOINT VENTURES; MANAGEMENT; ROUTINES; ALLIANCES; STRATEGY; SCIENCE; TRUST","Categories":"Psychology; Business & Economics Web of Science Categories:Psychology, Applied; Management","Journal Information":"GROUP & ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT Volume: 42 Issue: 2 Pages: 151-162 Special Issue: SI DOI: 10.1177/1059601117695138 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"The research on collaborative partnerships has accumulated a vast body of knowledge, which has assisted us with comprehending several complex organizational phenomena, including mergers and acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and entrepreneurial partnerships.

In order to demonstrate the relevance of this outlook at the present time, the author begins by examining recent debates concerning the nature of 'truth' in the clinical setting. Reflecting on the difficulties analysts face in attempting to maintain professional authority without falling into an implicit authoritarianism, it is argued that any approach to therapy seeking to orient itself towards 'the unconscious' must posit the challenges of pluralism as a central concern for practice. With reference to the relationship between analytical psychology and the psychoanalytic mainstream, attention is drawn to the theoretical problems raised by the relational commitment to constructivist epistemologies, and a consequent tendency towards biological reductionism. Turning to the Jungian literature, similar tensions are observed at play in the present state of analytical psychology. Drawing attention to the process-oriented qualities of Jung's work, it is suggested that the speculative nature of Jung's psychology offers a more adequate basis for contemporary practice than might be assumed.","Authors":"Brown, RS (Brown, Robin S.)","Title":"Bridging worlds: participatory thinking in Jungian context"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000398226100002 ISSN: 2214-8043 eISSN: 2214-8051","Keywords":"Excessive choice; Behavioral economics; Informal institutions; Field experiment; Craft beer KeyWords Plus:CONSUMER CHOICE; TIME PRESSURE; INFORMATION; ECONOMICS; VARIETY; TYRANNY; SEARCH; OPTION; MODEL; COST","Categories":"Business & Economics Web of Science Categories:Economics","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS Volume: 67 Pages: 8-13 DOI: 10.1016/j.socec.2017.01.008 Published: APR 2017","Abstract":"Research in psychology suggests that, somewhat paradoxically, providing consumers more choices can reduce the likelihood of making a purchase, producing the so-called excessive choice effect (ECE). To the extent an ECE exists, firms have an incentive to alleviate the effect through a variety of institutional nudges that promote consumers to make a choice. This study empirically tests the effectiveness of two institutional nudges on the ECE in a field experiment at a bar. Focusing on craft beer sales, we manipulate the number of options on the menu and use institutional nudges (a control menu, a menu with a special prominently displayed, and a menu with Beer Advocate scores). In the field experiment, the ECE was alive and well using the control menu, but the effect reversed itself when the menu included Beer Advocate scores.

A recent explanation for these biases has focused on people's awareness that many comparative judgment domains form skewed distributions, and, hence, a majority of people can feasibly be above or below average. Indeed, this prior research found that comparative biases for abilities emerged more for skewed (vs. normal) distributions. In the current research, we attempted to (i) conceptually replicate this finding in a comparative likelihood context and (ii) provide evidence of an alternative explanation for the prior results. Replicating prior research, three correlational studies and one experimental study found that event skewness was related to direct comparative likelihood judgments for health events, such that comparative optimism emerged more for events judged or manipulated to come from positively skewed distributions than from negatively skewed distributions. However, event skewness was unrelated to indirect comparisons (absolute self minus absolute other). Moreover, consistent with an egocentric-processes account, absolute self-judgments were more predictive of direct comparisons than were absolute other judgments and showed the same association with event skewness as direct comparisons. Implications for explaining and interpreting comparative judgment biases are discussed.

Recent attempts to adopt risk-sensitivity as a framework for understanding human decision-making have been promising. However, this research has focused on individual-level decision-making, has not examined behavior in naturalistic settings, and has not examined the influence of multiple levels of need on decision-making under risk. We examined group-level risk-sensitive decision-making in two American football leagues: the National Football League (NFL) and the National College Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I. Play decisions from the 2012 NFL (Study 1; N=33 944), 2013 NFL (Study 2; N=34 087), and 2012 NCAA (Study 3; N=15 250) regular seasons were analyzed. Results demonstrate that teams made risk-sensitive decisions based on two distinct needs: attaining first downs (a key proximate goal in football) and acquiring points above parity. Evidence for risk-sensitive decisions was particularly strong when motivational needs were most salient. These findings are the first empirical demonstration of team risk-sensitivity in a naturalistic organizational setting.

This positive effect holds even for situations involving inequality in punishment power, meaning that the relative costs for punishment differ between persons. We extend this line of research by examining the additional influence of instability of and thus potential competition for punishment power in public good experiments. As in previous research, inequality is operationalized by assigning the role of a 'strong player' to one group member, who can punish others at a reduced cost compared to other players. Instability is operationalized by the fact that the role assignment can change across rounds and is contingent on behavior in previous rounds. Three experiments show that under unequal, unstable (punishment-) power, individuals behave more competitively and engage in a race for power resulting in detrimental effects for the group. Specifically, we find that (i) unstable power goes along with a disproportionate use of punishment; (ii) not inequality by itself but rather the combination of instability and inequality causes this effect; and (iii) this excessive use of punishment is found not only when the role of the strong player is assigned to individuals who previously behaved rather selfishly but also when prosocial behavior leads to the top, speaking for a generalizability of our findings. Implications for organizational settings are discussed.

A sample of 150 students completed a battery of measures at the beginning of their period of A level study and again at the end. The data found no difference over this period of time in personal values (purpose in life, self-esteem, and empathy) in some moral values (concerning anti-social behaviour and concerning substance use) and in levels of religious exclusivism or frequency of private prayer. The areas in which significant differences were observed were concerned with attitude toward sex and relationships, religious pluralism, belief in life after death, and mystical orientation. Between the ages of 16 and 18years, following two years' engagement with Religious Studies at A level, the participants became more liberal in their approach toward sex and relationships, less convinced about the truth claims of religious pluralism, less likely to adhere to traditional Christian teaching on life after death, and less open to mystical experience. They are also less certain of ever having had a religious experience, and less frequent in their practice of religious attendance.","Authors":"Francis, LJ (Francis, Leslie J.) ; Village, A (Village, Andrew) ; Parker, SG (Parker, Stephen G.)","Title":"Exploring the trajectory of personal, moral and spiritual values of 16-to 18-year-old students taking religious studies at A level in the UK"}]
