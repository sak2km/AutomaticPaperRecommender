In online social media, such changes occur due to the effect of marketing, advertising, or changes in ground truth. First, we use the revealed preference framework to detect the unknown time point (change point) at which the utility function changed. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for detecting the change point. Second, in the presence of noisy measurements, we propose a method to detect the change point and construct a decision test. Also, an optimization criteria is provided to recover the linear perturbation coefficients. Finally, to reduce the computational cost, a dimensionality reduction algorithm using Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform is presented. The results developed are illustrated on two real datasets: Yahoo! Tech Buzz dataset and Youstatanalyzer dataset. By using the results developed in the paper, several useful insights can be gleaned from these datasets. First, the changes in ground truth affecting the utility of the agent can be detected by utility maximization behavior in online search. Second, the recovered utility functions satisfy the single crossing property indicating strategic substitute behavior in online search. Finally, due to the large number of videos in YouTube, the utility maximization behavior was verified through the dimensionality reduction algorithm.","Authors":"Aprem, A (Aprem, Anup) ; Krishnamurthy, V (Krishnamurthy, Vikram)","Title":"Utility Change Point Detection in Online Social Media: A Revealed Preference Framework"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397371600009 PubMed ID: 28256359 ISSN: 0264-410X eISSN: 1873-2518","Keywords":"Epidemic; Measles; Public health; Epidemiology KeyWords Plus:UNITED-STATES; OUTBREAKS","Categories":"Immunology; Research & Experimental Medicine Web of Science Categories:Immunology; Medicine, Research & Experimental","Journal Information":"VACCINE Volume: 35 Issue: 13 Pages: 1721-1728 DOI: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.02.023 Published: MAR 23 2017","Abstract":"The measles virus circulation was halted in Brazil in 2001 and the country has a routine vaccination coverage against measles, mumps and rubella higher than 95%. In Ceara, the last confirmed case was in 1999. This article describes the strategies adopted and the effectiveness of surveillance and control measures implemented during a measles epidemic in the post-elimination period. The epidemic started in December 2013 and lasted 20 months, reaching 38 cities and 1,052 confirmed cases. The D8 genotype was identified. More than 50,000 samples were tested for measles and 86.4% of the confirmed cases had a laboratory diagnosis. The beginning of an campaign vaccination was delayed in part by the availability of vaccine. The classic control measures were not enough to control the epidemic. The creation of a committee of experts, the agreement signed between managers of the three spheres of government, the conducting of an institutional active search of suspected cases, vaccination door to door at alternative times, the use of micro planning, a broad advertising campaign at local media and technical operative support contributed to containing the epidemic. It is important to recognize the possibility of epidemics at this stage of post-elimination and prepare a sensitive surveillance system for timely response. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

What is less obvious is whether firms with lower-quality brands should also follow suit and emphasize quality in their advertising to signal a higher quality. We examine this issue and study the effectiveness of quality-based advertising messages. Our field study relates brands' monthly sales to their advertised quality claims across 1,876 print ads in national magazines and Consumer Reports-based product quality ratings over more than two decades. Contrary to the generally held yet erroneous belief in the efficacy of low-quality products emphasizing quality in their advertising, we demonstrate that (1) it is not beneficial for a low-quality firm to emphasize quality in its advertising, and (2) it is effective for a high-quality firm to do so. An analysis of parameter values from a published category-agnostic simulation and an experiment that examines consumers' responses to quality claims in a second product category yields convergent insights.","Authors":"Kopalle, PK (Kopalle, Praveen K.) ; Fisher, RJ (Fisher, Robert J.) ; Sud, BL (Sud, Bharat L.) ; Antia, KD (Antia, Kersi D.)","Title":"The Effects of Advertised Quality Emphasis and Objective Quality on Sales"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395573100013 PubMed ID: 26867204 ISSN: 1050-642X eISSN: 1536-3724","Keywords":"concussion; concussion clinic; healthcare provider; online; Google KeyWords Plus:INTERNATIONAL-CONFERENCE; SPORT; MANAGEMENT; STATEMENT","Categories":"Orthopedics; Physiology; Sport Sciences Web of Science Categories:Orthopedics; Physiology; Sport Sciences","Journal Information":"CLINICAL JOURNAL OF SPORT MEDICINE Volume: 27 Issue: 2 Pages: 179-182 DOI: 10.1097/JSM.0000000000000305 Published: MAR 2017","Abstract":"Background:Concussion is an emerging public health concern, but care of patients with a concussion is presently unregulated in Canada.Methods:Independent, blinded Google Internet searches were conducted for the terms concussion and concussion clinic and each of the Canadian provinces and territories.

The durations of these visits vary not only across consumers but also for a given consumer across multiple visits. We argue that the amount of time that a consumer spends on the first visit to a website depends on how she is drawn to the website. We find that the duration of the first visit is influenced by the advertising tool-banner ad or search engine-used to attract consumers to the website. The durations of subsequent visits are influenced by the durations of earlier visits. The search durations are also influenced by the visit day of the week and time of day. In this paper, we develop a multiple-spell competing risk model to capture the underlying stochastic process, chief elements of which are two interrelated processes: a duration process and a transition process. The multistate, multiple-spell model allows us to identify a window of opportunity, within which the purchase probability is higher than the exit probability. Online salespersons should target site visitors during this window of opportunity. The model, which is calibrated on clickstream data obtained from a major online vendor, can also be used to determine the bid price strategy for search engine ads.","Authors":"Bhatnagar, A (Bhatnagar, Amit) ; Sen, A (Sen, Arun) ; Sinha, AP (Sinha, Atish P.)","Title":"Providing a Window of Opportunity for Converting eStore Visitors"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397991600011 ISSN: 0190-9320 eISSN: 1573-6687","Keywords":"Affective polarization; Information search; Negative advertising; Partisan media environment; Political polarization; Selective exposure KeyWords Plus:POLITICAL COMMUNICATION; PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS; BIAS; PERCEPTIONS; ELECTIONS; ISSUE; NEWS; PREDISPOSITIONS; ELECTORATE; ARGUMENTS","Categories":"Government & Law Web of Science Categories:Political Science","Journal Information":"POLITICAL BEHAVIOR Volume: 39 Issue: 1 Pages: 231-255 DOI: 10.1007/s11109-016-9354-8 Published: MAR 2017","Abstract":"This paper examines the effects of our modern media environment on affective polarization.

Facebook's wide accessibility and popularity among the age group that comprises the majority of veterans from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan make it a compelling resource through which research can extend its reach to this otherwise hard-to-reach group. We developed a series of Facebook advertisement campaigns to reach veteran drinkers not specifically searching for alcohol treatment. In doing so, we recruited 793 valid veteran participants in approximately two weeks for an advertising cost of $4.53 per obtained participant. The study sample consisted primarily of male veterans, between 19 and 34 years of age, who were drinking at moderate to heavy levels. Although about half of the sample reported mental health comorbidity, few had received any mental health or substance use treatment in the past year. Facebook appears to be a valuable mechanism through which to recruit young veterans with unmet behavioral health needs, although more specific efforts may be needed to engage certain types of veterans after initial study enrollment.","Authors":"Pedersen, ER (Pedersen, Eric R.) ; Naranjo, D (Naranjo, Diana) ; Marshall, GN (Marshall, Grant N.)","Title":"Recruitment and retention of young adult veteran drinkers using Facebook"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000394075600010 PubMed ID: 27889114 ISSN: 0955-3959 eISSN: 1873-4758","Keywords":"Hidden web; Dark web; Ocfentanil; Adulteration; Heroin; Fentanyl derivatives KeyWords Plus:PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES; DRUG MARKETPLACE; SILK ROAD; AUSTRALIA; MORTALITY","Categories":"Substance Abuse Web of Science Categories:Substance Abuse","Journal Information":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY Volume: 40 Pages: 78-83 DOI: 10.1016/j.drugpo.2016.10.006 Published: FEB 2017","Abstract":"Background: The popularization of anonymous markets such as Silk Road is challenging current drug policy and may provide a new context for old issues, such as adulteration of heroin with fentanyl derivatives. The aims of this paper are to report the presence of ocfentanil, a novel, potent, non controlled fentanyl analog, in samples sold as heroin in the hidden web, and to summarize the effects reported by users. Methods: In 2015, four samples allegedly bought as heroin in cryptomarkets of the hidden web were sent to Energy Control for analysis. Energy Control is a Spanish harm reduction NGO that offers anonymous drug checking with the purpose of adapting counselling to the specific substances present in the drug and monitor the drug market. Identification was performed by GC/MS and LC/MS/MS. We contacted the submitters of the samples and performed an Internet search to retrieve additional information. Results: One sample contained ocfentanil, caffeine and heroin. Three samples contained the aforementioned substances plus paracetamol. Two out of the four contacted users reported distinct short acting, opioid-like effects. No fora discussion could be found about the effects of ocfentanil, neither web pages nor individuals advertising the substance. Conclusion: We report the presence of a new substance detected in the hidden web as an adulterant of heroin, ocfentanil. It has short acting opioid-like effects, roughly the same potency as fentanyl, and can be injected, snorted or smoked. Severe side effects have been associated with its use, including one death. No discussion about this substance could be found in the Internet, which suggests this substance has not been sold as such. Available data about purities of drugs purchased in cryptomarkets suggest that adulteration is not a severe problem and this agrees with users' perceptions. However, this study suggests that adulteration is a real threat not only at the street level, but also for users that buy substances in cryptomarkets, and suggest the need for harm reduction initiatives in this setting.

The empirical settings are the U.S. motion picture and video game industries. The focal variables include weekly ad spend, blog volume, online search volume during pre-launch periods, opening-week sales, and product characteristics. We treat pre-launch search volume of keywords as a measure of pre-launch consumer interest in the related product. To identify probable persistent effects among the pre-launch time-series variables, we apply a vector autoregressive modeling approach. We find that blog postings have permanent, trend-setting effects on pre-launch consumer interest in a new product, while advertising has only temporary effects. In the U.S. motion picture industry, the four-week cumulative elasticity of pre-launch consumer interest is 0.187 to advertising and 0.635 to blog postings. In the U.S. video game industry, the elasticities are 0.093 and 1.306, respectively. We also find long-run co-evolution between blog and search volume, which suggests that consumers' interest in the upcoming product cannot grow without bounds for a given level of blog volume.

Results Of the 19 studies evaluating a specific marketing code and 25 content analysis studies reviewed, all detected content that could be considered potentially harmful to children and adolescents, including themes that appeal strongly to young men. Of the 57 studies of alcohol advertising exposure, high levels of youth exposure and high awareness of alcohol advertising were found for television, radio, print, digital and outdoor advertisements. Youth exposure to alcohol advertising has increased over time, even as greater compliance with exposure thresholds has been documented. Conclusions Violations of the content guidelines within self-regulated alcohol marketing codes are highly prevalent in certain media.

In addition to statutory regulation, industry self-regulation is a common way to protect adolescents from alcohol marketing exposures.

Methods Peer-reviewed papers were identified through four literature search engines: PubMed, SCOPUS, PsychINFO and CINAHL. Non-peer-reviewed reports produced by public health agencies, alcohol research centers, non-governmental organizations, government research centers and national industry advertising associations were also included. Results The search process yielded three peer-reviewed papers, seven non-peer reviewed reports published by academic institutes and non-profit organizations and 20 industry reports. The evidence indicates that the complaint process lacks standardization across countries, industry adjudicators may be trained inadequately or biased and few complaints are upheld against advertisements pre-determined to contain violations of a self-regulatory code. Conclusions The current alcohol industry marketing complaint process used in a wide variety of countries may be ineffective at removing potentially harmful content from the market-place. The process of determining the validity of complaints employed by most industry groups appears to suffer from serious conflict of interest and procedural weaknesses that could compromise objective adjudication of even well-documented complaints. In our opinion the current system of self-regulation needs major modifications if it is to serve public health objectives, and more systematic evaluations of the complaint process are needed.","Authors":"Noel, JK (Noel, Jonathan K.) ; Babor, TF (Babor, Thomas F.)","Title":"Does industry self-regulation protect young people from exposure to alcohol marketing?

The strength of the evidence base differed according to type of marketing exposure and drinking outcome studied, with support for an association between alcohol promotion (mainly advertising) and drinking outcomes in adolescence, whilst only two studies examined the relationship between alcohol price and the drinking behaviour of those under the age of 18. Conclusion: Despite the volume of work, evidence is inconclusive in all four areas of marketing but strongest for promotional activity. Future research with standardized measures is needed to build on this work and better inform interventions and policy responses.","Authors":"Scott, S (Scott, Stephanie) ; Muirhead, C (Muirhead, Colin) ; Shucksmith, J (Shucksmith, Janet) ; Tyrrell, R (Tyrrell, Rachel) ; Kaner, E (Kaner, Eileen)","Title":"Does Industry-Driven Alcohol Marketing Influence Adolescent Drinking Behaviour?

This management requires 360i to develop advertising copy, allocate budgets, and generate bids for a second-price auction across millions of keywords, seasons, geographies, device types, and audience segments. To ensure that it captures the right click each time, 360i built a technology suite that is unique in the industry. This suite includes natural-language processing that combines keywords with the right advertising copy and landing pages to maximize relevance to the consumer. It offers advanced forecasting and optimization to allocate budgets where and when they are needed, and supports predictive bidding, which uses linguistic similarity as a proxy for performance correlation between keywords, to calculate accurate bids for keywords with sparse data. Finally, it delivers performance monitoring that unscrambles an opaque real-time auction to address campaign performance issues before they occur. The system has been a major contributor to 360i's winning multiple awards. Most importantly, the application of advanced operations research techniques has generated nearly $1 billion in incremental revenue for 360i's paid-search clients.","Authors":"Geraghty, K (Geraghty, Kevin) ; Sonmezer, E (Sonmezer, Eric) ; Maron, M (Maron, Matthew) ; Ruble, D (Ruble, Daniel)","Title":"360i Generates Nearly $1 Billion in Revenue for Internet Paid-Search Clients"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000397234500006 ISSN: 0368-492X eISSN: 1758-7883","Keywords":"Advertising mechanism; Consumer search cost; e-Business platform; Search-based advertising KeyWords Plus:MODEL; PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION; MARKET","Categories":"Computer Science Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Cybernetics","Journal Information":"KYBERNETES Volume: 46 Issue: 2 Pages: 291-309 DOI: 10.1108/K-10-2016-0296 Published: 2017","Abstract":"Purpose - Consumers are increasingly using search-based advertising in e-Business platforms to seek their desirable products. Platforms will choose a centralized advertising mechanism (CAM) or decentralized advertising mechanism (DAM) to offer a search advertising service to lower consumer search cost, as represented by using search time length. It is important for the platform to decide how to choose advertising mechanisms, and how to determine the optimal advertising price and search time length. To address these issues, this study aims to develop a theoretical approach under each mechanism to examine the platform's optimal search-based advertising strategy by considering search cost. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, two models are developed to examine the optimal search-based advertising strategy by considering consumer search cost (i.e. search time length). By comparing the platform's profits under two models, the optimal advertising strategy, search time length and price are explored. Findings - It is found that when the seller's reserve benefit is sufficiently large, the platform benefits from choosing the DAM; otherwise, the CAM is a better choice. The advertising service is usually offered with a shorter search time length accompanied by a higher charge, and a longer search time length accompanied by a lower charge. Specifically, when the seller's reserve benefit is substantially high, a DAM that benefits both the platform and seller is a better choice. This can explain why many platforms offer advertising services with a DAM. Originality/value - This paper is the first theoretical study on addressing the search-based advertising strategy, especially the choice of advertising mechanisms, in the online advertising context. It is also the first piece of analytical research that considers the effect of consumer search cost on product demand, and then examines the optimal advertising price and search cost (i.e. search time length) for online platforms.","Authors":"Ma, BQ (Ma, Buqing) ; Xu, XY (Xu, Xiaoyan) ; Sun, YH (Sun, Yanhong) ; Bian, YW (Bian, Yiwen)","Title":"Online search-based advertising strategy for e-Business platform with the consideration of consumer search cost"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000395589100004 ISSN: 1355-5855 eISSN: 1758-4248","Keywords":"ELM; Content analysis; Emotional appeal; Nostalgic advertising; Resource matching hypothesis; Television ads KeyWords Plus:CULTURAL-DIFFERENCES; INFORMATION-CONTENT; PERSONAL NOSTALGIA; EMOTIONAL APPEALS; MODERATING ROLE; CONSUMER; MAGAZINE; PRODUCTS; REFLECTIONS; PREFERENCES","Categories":"Business & Economics Web of Science Categories:Business","Journal Information":"ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS Volume: 29 Issue: 1 Pages: 47-69 DOI: 10.1108/APJML-10-2015-0152 Published: 2017","Abstract":"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the presence of nostalgic advertising in Indian television and its execution with reference to extent of information disclosure, level of involvement, type of products and stages in product life cycle (PLC).

Findings - Humour/happiness was the most commonly used emotional appeal and nostalgic ads constituted 12 per cent of the emotional ads in Indian television. \"References to past family experiences\" was the most commonly used nostalgic element. As hypothesised, nostalgic ads use low information disclosure strategy (vis-a-vis high/medium information disclosure strategy) and are more commonly used for low involvement products (vis-a-vis high involvement products), experience products (vis-a-vis search products), and non-durables (vis-a-vis durables). Also, nostalgic appeals are more commonly used at maturity stage of PLC (vis-a-vis introduction stage). Originality/value - This is the first research to analyse the content and execution of nostalgic advertising in India. This study is also one of the first to provide a comprehensive framework on nostalgic advertising. The interrelationships among variables such as product category, process of emotional appeal, degree of information disclosure and stage in PLC has not been investigated earlier, in the context of nostalgic advertising.

An intelligent decision support system providing balance between user experience and profits from online advertising based on the fuzzy multi objective optimization model is presented in this paper. The generalized mathematical model uses uncertain parameters for content descriptors that are difficult to be precisely defined and measured, such as the level of intrusiveness and the change in performance over time. The search for final decision solutions and the verification of the proposed model are based on experimental results from both perceptual studies, which are evaluating visibility and intrusiveness of marketing content as well as online campaigns providing interaction data for estimation of effectiveness. Surprisingly, the online response to the most noticeable advertisements with highly perceived visibility and intrusiveness was relatively low. During the field study performed in order to compute the model parameters, the best results were achieved for advertising content with moderate visual influence on web users. Simulations with the proposed model revealed that a growing level of persuasion can increase results only to a certain extent. Above a saturation point, a strategy based on extensive visual effects, such as high-frequency flashing, resulted in a very high increase of intrusiveness and a slightly better performance in terms of acquired interactions. Proposed balanced content design with the use of intelligent decision support system creates directions towards sustainable advertising and a friendlier online environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a massive individual-level data set, our paper captures the effectiveness of display advertising across a wide range of consumer behaviors. Two unique features of our data set that distinguish this paper from prior work are (1) the information on the actual viewability of impressions as on average 55% of the display ads are not rendered viewable and (2) the duration of exposure to the display advertisements, both at the individual-user level. Employing a quasi-experiment enabled by our setting, we use difference-in-differences and corresponding matching methods as well as instrumental variable techniques to control for unobservable and observable confounders. We empirically demonstrate that mere exposure to display advertising increases users' propensity to search for the brand and the corresponding product; consumers engage both in active search exerting effort to gather information, and in passive search using information sources that arrive exogenously. We also find statistically and economically significant effects of display advertising on increasing consumers' propensity to make a purchase. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the longer the duration of exposure to display advertising, the more likely the consumers are to engage in direct search behaviors (e.g., direct visits) rather than indirect ones (e.g., search engine inquiries). We also study the effects of various types of display advertising (e.g., prospecting, retargeting, affiliate targeting, video advertising, etc.)and the different goals they achieve. Our framework for evaluating display advertising effectiveness constitutes stepping stone toward causally addressing the digital attribution problem.","Authors":"Ghose, A (Ghose, Anindya) ; Todri-Adamopoulos, V (Todri-Adamopoulos, Vilma)","Title":"TOWARD A DIGITAL ATTRIBUTION MODEL: MEASURING THE IMPACT OF DISPLAY ADVERTISING ON ONLINE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000391438200004 PubMed ID: 26728139 ISSN: 0964-4563 eISSN: 1468-3318","Categories":"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health Web of Science Categories:Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Journal Information":"TOBACCO CONTROL Volume: 25 Issue: E2 Pages: E83-E89 DOI: 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2015-052586 Published: DEC 2016","Abstract":"Introduction Previous systematic reviews have found consistent evidence of a positive association between exposure to point-of-sale (POS) tobacco promotion and increased smoking and smoking susceptibility among children and adolescents. No meta-analysis has been conducted on these studies to date. Methods Systematic literature searches were carried out to identify all quantitative observational studies that examined the relationship between POS tobacco promotion and individual-level smoking and smoking-related cognitions among children and adolescents, published between January 1990 and June 2014. Random-effects meta-analyses were used. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to extent of tobacco POS advertising environment in the study environment. Sensitivity analyses were performed according to study size and quality. Results 13 studies met the inclusion criteria; 11 reported data for behavioural outcomes, 6 for cognitive outcomes (each of these assessed smoking susceptibility). The studies were cross-sectional, with the exception of 2 cohort studies. For the behavioural outcomes, the pooled OR was 1.61 (95% CI 1.33 to 1.96) and for smoking susceptibility the pooled OR was 1.32 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.61). Conclusions Children and adolescents more frequently exposed to POS tobacco promotion have around 1.6 times higher odds of having tried smoking and around 1.3 times higher odds of being susceptible to future smoking, compared with those less frequently exposed. Together with the available evaluations of POS display bans, the results strongly indicate that legislation banning tobacco POS promotion will effectively reduce smoking among young people.","Authors":"Robertson, L (Robertson, Lindsay) ; Cameron, C (Cameron, Claire) ; Mcgee, R (Mcgee, Rob) ; Marsh, L (Marsh, Louise) ; Hoek, J (Hoek, Janet)","Title":"Point-of-sale tobacco promotion and youth smoking: a meta-analysis"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000389698900001 ISSN: 0022-2437 eISSN: 1547-7193","Keywords":"search engines; organic search; sponsored search advertising; user interface; channel substitution KeyWords Plus:INTERNET; QUALITY","Categories":"Business & Economics Web of Science Categories:Business","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH Volume: 53 Issue: 6 Pages: 881-900 DOI: 10.1509/jmr.14.0528 Published: DEC 2016","Abstract":"The authors examine prominent placement of search engines' own services and effects on users' choices.

One approach to addressing this challenge is identifying cooperative and stable bidding strategies for competing advertisers with the objective of reaching socially optimal outcomes in repeated SSA auctions. Although useful in analyzing advertiSers' bidding behavior in single auction sessions, static game-theoretic analysis and simulation studies in the extant SSA literature offer only limited insights for characterizing the long-term evolutionary dynamics and stability of advertisers' bidding behavior. In this paper, we address this problem by applying evolutionary game theory and Coevolutionary simulation. Our key finding is that a group of \"nice\" and retaliatory (NR) strategies can promote stable cooperation among competing advertisers. Advertisers using NR strategies will never deviate from cooperation first (nice) and always punish their rivals' deviations using competitive bids (retaliatory). The NR strategies are shown to be able to encourage advertisers to decrease their bids to obtain revenue that is equal to that awarded under the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction mechanism and are further shown to alleviate bid inflation effectively at the system level.

This study expands on this understanding by exploring how individual differences in the ability to control attention (i.e., working memory capacity; WMC) might further moderate the effect of attention on advertising. Participants who varied in WMC were evaluated on their attitudes towards a consumer brand before and after viewing a video advertisement. While the advertisement did make participants more positive towards the product overall, this change in attitude was directly related to participants' ability to control attention and the degree to which the ad fostered the activation of autobiographical memories. Further, these changes in attitude were unrelated to how well the ad was remembered. This suggests that individual differences in attentional control can influence how advertisements impact customer attitude and the acceptance of persuasive messaging.

Searches of electronic databases and reference lists of relevant articles were conducted to retrieve studies of relevance up until December 2015. Full texts of the studies that met the inclusion criteria were read, appraised for quality using the Kmet forms and guidelines, and included in this review. Fifteen relevant studies were identified. The included studies were a mix of cross-sectional, longitudinal, experimental and qualitative studies conducted in the USA, the UK, Australia and New Zealand. The age range of the participants involved in these studies was 12-25 years. Included studies employed a variety of study designs and a range of different exposure variables and outcome measures. Studies demonstrated significant associations between exposure to Internet-based alcohol-related content and intentions to drink and positive attitudes towards alcohol drinking among young people. Exposure to alcohol-related content on the Internet might predispose young people to patterns of alcohol use by promoting alcohol as a natural and vital part of life. However, the research exploring the influence of this novel form of advertising on young people's alcohol use is emergent, and comprised primarily of cross-sectional studies. To evaluate the direction of the association between exposure to online alcohol-related content and alcohol use, we call for further research based on longitudinal designs. From 15 relevant studies identified, this review reports significant associations between exposure to Internet-based alcohol-related content and intentions to drink and positive attitudes towards alcohol drinking among young people, with different influences found at different stages of alcohol use.","Authors":"Gupta, H (Gupta, Himanshu) ; Pettigrew, S (Pettigrew, Simone) ; Lam, T (Lam, Tina) ; Tait, RJ (Tait, Robert J.)

These attributed credits impact a firm's future bidding and budget allocations among keywords and, in turn, determine the overall return-on-investment of search campaigns. In this paper, we model the relationship among the advertiser's bidding decision for keywords, the search engine's ranking decision for these keywords, and the consumer's click-through rate and conversion rate on each keyword, and analyze the impact of the attribution strategy on the overall return-on-investment of paid search advertising. We estimate our simultaneous equations model using a six-month panel data of several hundred keywords from an online jewelry retailer. The data comprises a quasi-experiment as the firm changed attribution strategy from last-click to first-click attribution halfway through the data window. Our results show that returns for keyword investments vary significantly under the different attribution strategies. For the focal firm, first-click attribution leads to lower revenue returns and a more pronounced decrease for more specific keywords. Our policy simulation exercise shows how the firm can increase its overall returns by better attributing the real contribution of keywords. We discuss how an appropriate attribution strategy can help firms to better target customers and lower acquisition costs in the context of paid search advertising.","Authors":"Li, HS (Li, Hongshuang (Alice)) ; Kannan, PK (Kannan, P.

To provide regulators and the US Food and Drug Administration with a description of cessation-themed advertising among electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) brands. Methods. We performed a content analysis of 6 months (January through June 2015) of advertising by e-cigarette brands on their company-sponsored social media channels and blogs as well as user-generated content (testimonials) appearing within brand-sponsored Web sites. An explicit claim of cessation efficacy unambiguously states that e-cigarettes help in quitting smoking, and implicit claims use euphemisms such as \"It works.\" We selected a cohort of 23 leading e-cigarette brands, either by their rank in advertising spending or their prevalence in Internet searches. Results. Among leading e-cigarette brands, 22 of 23 used cessation-themed advertisements. Overall, 23% of the advertisements contained cessation claims, of which 18% were explicit and 82% were implicit. Conclusions. Among leading e-cigarette advertisers, cessation themes are prevalent with implicit messaging predominating over explicit quit claims. Policy implications. These results can help the Food and Drug Administration clarify whether tobacco products should be regulated as drugs with therapeutic purpose or as recreational products.","Authors":"Ramamurthi, D (Ramamurthi, Divya) ; Gall, PA (Gall, Phillip A.) ; Ayoub, N (Ayoub, Noel) ; Jackler, RK (Jackler, Robert K.)","Title":"Leading-Brand Advertisement of Quitting Smoking Benefits for E-Cigarettes"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000388111100006 PubMed ID: 27872032 ISSN: 1438-8871","Keywords":"smoking cessation; online advertising; computational advertising KeyWords Plus:PUBLIC-HEALTH","Categories":"Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics Web of Science Categories:Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Volume: 18 Issue: 11 Article Number: e306 DOI: 10.2196/jmir.6563 Published: NOV 2016","Abstract":"Background: Although hundreds of millions of dollars are spent each year on public health advertising, the advertisement content, design, and placement are usually developed by intuition rather than research. Objective: The objective of our study was to develop a methodology for testing Web-based advertisements to promote smoking cessation. Methods: We developed 10 advertisements that varied by their content (those that empower viewers to quit, help viewers to quit, or discuss the effects of smoking). We then conducted a series of Web-based randomized controlled trials that explored the effects of exposing users of Microsoft's Bing search engine to antismoking advertisements that differed by content, placement, or other characteristics. Finally, we followed users to explore whether they conducted subsequent searches for smoking cessation products or services. Results: The advertisements were shown 710,106 times and clicked on 1167 times. In general, empowering advertisements had the greatest impact (hazard ratio [HR] 2.6, standard error [SE] 0.09 relative to nonempowering advertisements), but we observed significant variations by gender. For instance, we found that men exposed to smoking cessation advertisements were less likely than women to subsequently conduct smoking cessation searches (HR 0.2, SE 0.07), but that this likelihood increased 3.5 times in men exposed to advertisements containing empowering content. Women were more influenced by advertisements that emphasized the health effects of smoking. We also found that appearing at the top right of the page (HR 2.1, SE 0.07) or at the bottom rather than the top of a list (HR 1.1, SE 0.02) can improve smoking cessation advertisements' effectiveness in prompting future searches related to smoking cessation. Conclusions: Advertising should be targeted to different demographic groups in ways that are not always intuitive. Our study provides a method for testing the effectiveness of Web-based antismoking advertisements and demonstrates the importance of advertisements that are tailored according to specific demographics.","Authors":"Yom-Tov, E (Yom-Tov, Elad) ; Muennig, P (Muennig, Peter) ; El-Sayed, AM (El-Sayed, Abdulrahman M.)

A central resource allocation platform is in charge of allocating the items to the potential buyers, with the goal of maximizing the total revenue subject to budget and resource constraints. Sponsored search advertising is a typical example: in order to maximize revenue, search engines try to choose the best available advertisement to display on a web page resulting from a search query. Two main approaches have been proposed to address such online problems, depending on the assumptions made about the input sequence: one is trying to guarantee a performance against a worst case scenario (sometimes called the adversarial model); the other one, based on specific probabilistic assumptions about the input, is concerned with expected performance guarantee. However, combining the strengths of these two approaches could potentially outperform both in some settings. In this paper we propose such a practical method which goes beyond the adversarial model but requires only a limited amount of information about the future. We provide extensive computational results which demonstrate settings under which the performance of the proposed algorithm becomes attractive. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Reference lists and an online repository of DTCA manuscripts were also scrutinized. Study Selection: English-language studies collecting data at the point of service, focusing on or including psychiatric medication, and assessing the effects of DTCA on patient and/or physician behavior were included. Of 989 articles identified, 69 received full-text review. Four studies across 5 manuscripts met inclusion criteria. Data Extraction: Data were extracted on participants, study design, methodological quality, and results. Methodological quality of individual studies was assessed using adapted criteria from the Effective Public Health Practice Project. Confidence in conclusions across studies was determined using principles from the well-established GRADE system. Findings: Due to lack of replication across strong randomized controlled trials (RCTs), no conclusions merited high confidence. With moderate confidence, we concluded that DTCA requests (1) are granted most of the time (1 RCT, 3 observational), (2) prompt higher prescribing volume (1 RCT, 1 observational), (3) promote greater adherence to minimally acceptable treatment guidelines for patients with depression (1 RCT), and (4) stimulate overprescribing among patients with an adjustment disorder (1 RCT). Conclusions: Findings suggest that DTCA requests are typically accommodated, promote higher prescribing volume, and have competing effects on treatment quality. More methodologically strong studies are needed to increase confidence in conclusions.

Access to smartphone apps is rapidly increasing among youth, but little is known about the strategies that apps employ to prevent pregnancy among adolescents and young adults. Further, there are no guidelines on best practices for adolescent and young adult pregnancy prevention through mobile apps. Objective: This review developed a preliminary evaluation framework for the assessment of mobile apps for adolescent and young adult pregnancy prevention and used this framework to assess available apps in the Apple App Store and Google Play that targeted adolescents and young adults with family planning and pregnancy prevention support. Methods: We developed an assessment rubric called Mobile Criteria for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention (mCAPP) for data extraction using evidence-based and promising best practices from the literature. mCAPP comprises 4 domains: (1) app characteristics, (2) user interface features, (3) adolescent pregnancy prevention best practices, and (4) general sexual and reproductive health (SRH) features. For inclusion in the review, apps that advertised pregnancy prevention services and explicitly mentioned youth, were in English, and were free were systematically identified in the Apple App Store and Google Play in 2015. Screening, data extraction, and 4 interrater reliability checks were conducted by 2 reviewers. Each app was assessed for 92 facets of the mCAPP checklist. Results: Our search returned 4043 app descriptions in the Apple App Store (462) and Google Play (3581). After screening for inclusion criteria, 22 unique apps were included in our analysis. Included apps targeted teens in primarily developed countries, and the most common user interface features were clinic and health service locators. While app strengths included provision of SRH education, description of modern contraceptives, and some use of evidence-based adolescent best practices, gaps remain in the implementation of the majority of adolescent best practices and user interface features. Of the 8 best practices for teen pregnancy prevention operationalized through mCAPP, the most commonly implemented best practice was the provision of information on how to use contraceptives to prevent pregnancy (15/22), followed by provision of accurate information on pregnancy risk of sexual behaviors (13/22); information on SRH communication, negotiation, or refusal skills (10/22); and the use of persuasive language around contraceptive use (9/22). Conclusions: The quality and scope of apps for adolescent pregnancy prevention varies, indicating that developers and researchers may need a supportive framework. mCAPP can help researchers and developers consider mobile-relevant evidence-based best practices for adolescent SRH as they develop teen pregnancy prevention apps. Given the novelty of the mobile approach, further research is needed on the impact of mCAPP criteria via mobile channels on adolescent health knowledge, behaviors, and outcomes.","Authors":"Chen, E (Chen, Elizabeth) ; Mangone, ER (Mangone, Emily Rose)","Title":"A Systematic Review of Apps using Mobile Criteria for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention (mCAPP)"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000390639100005 ISSN: 0308-5961 eISSN: 1879-3258","Keywords":"Domestic search engine; Online advertising market; Two-sided market KeyWords Plus:2-SIDED MARKETS; PERSONALIZED SEARCH; MASS-MEDIA; COMPETITION; EXPENDITURES; COUNTRIES; CHINA; BAIDU; PANEL","Categories":"Communication; Information Science & Library Science; Telecommunications Web of Science Categories:Communication; Information Science & Library Science; Telecommunications","Journal Information":"TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY Volume: 40 Issue: 10-11 Pages: 982-995 DOI: 10.1016/j.telpol.2016.05.005 Published: OCT 2016","Abstract":"A few global search engine platforms, notably Google and Yahoo!, have achieved worldwide dominance in the search engine market.

This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials aimed to assess the effects of unhealthy food and beverage marketing on dietary intake (grams or kilocalories) and dietary preference (preference score or percentage of participants who selected specific foods/beverages) among children 2 to 18 years of age. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO up to January 2015 for terms related to advertising, unhealthy foods or beverages among children. Randomized trials that assessed the effects of unhealthy food and beverage marketing compared with non-dietary advertisement or no advertisement in children were considered eligible. Two authors independently extracted information on study characteristics and outcomes of interest and assessed risk of bias and the overall quality of evidence using GRADE methodology. Meta-analysis was conducted separately for dietary intake and preference using a random-effects model. We identified 29 eligible studies, of which 17 studies were included for meta-analysis of dietary preference and nine for meta-analysis of dietary intake. Almost half of the studies were at high risk of bias. Our meta-analysis showed that in children exposed to unhealthy dietary marketing, dietary intake significantly increased (mean difference [MD] = 30.4 kcal, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9 to 57.9, and MD=4.8 g, 95% CI 0.8 to 8.8) during or shortly after exposure to advertisements. Similarly, children exposed to the unhealthy dietary marketing had a higher risk of selecting the advertised foods or beverages (relative risk = 1.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.2; P = 0.052). The evidence indicates that unhealthy food and beverage marketing increases dietary intake (moderate quality evidence) and preference (moderate to low quality evidence) for energy-dense, low-nutrition food and beverage. Unhealthy food and beverage marketing increased dietary intake and influenced dietary preference in children during or shortly after exposure to advertisements.

Compensated dating typically involves the use of information communication technology to advertise, search, bargain, and eventually arrange for transactional sex. The technology enables the sexual partners to maintain privacy and secrecy in transactional sex. Such secrecy necessitates the girls' disclosure about their life experiences in order to address the concern. The disclosure is the focus of the present qualitative study of 27 girls practicing the dating in Hong Kong, China. Based on the disclosure, the study presents a grounded theory that epitomizes engagement in compensated dating by referential choice. Such a referential choice theory unravels that choice with reference to the family push and social norms sustains the engagement. Meanwhile, the choice rests on expectancy and reinforcement from experiential learning about compensated dating. The theory thus implies ways to undercut the engagement through diverting the referential choice of the dating. (C) 2016 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

However, following advertising theories and previous research, the dominance of the market power function (i.e. product differentiation) and the information function (i.e. market transparency) are identified as major co-determinants for international tourism demand. Demand elasticity coefficients are empirically estimated for the origin countries Norway, Finland, the Russian Federation, Denmark and the UK.

We constructed a matrix of general, semantic, and location-based features from search logs of users that had 42 or more search days preceding a medical facility visit as well as from search logs of users that had no medical visits and trained statistical learners for predicting future medical visits. We then carried out a closed-loop evaluation of the utility of health care use predictions using the show conversion rates of advertisements displayed to the predicted future utilizers. In the context of behaviorally targeted advertising, wherein health care providers are interested in minimizing their cost per conversion, the association between show conversion rate and predicted utilization score, served as a surrogate measure of the model's utility. Results: We obtained the highest area under the curve (0.796) in medical visit prediction with our random forests model and daywise features. Ablating feature categories one at a time showed that the model performance worsened the most when location features were dropped. An online evaluation in which advertisements were served to users who had a high predicted probability of a future medical visit showed a 3.96% increase in the show conversion rate. Conclusions: Results from our experiments done in a research setting suggest that it is possible to accurately predict future patient visits from geotagged mobile search logs. Results from the offline and online experiments on the utility of health utilization predictions suggest that such prediction can have utility for health care providers.","Authors":"Agarwal, V (Agarwal, Vibhu) ; Zhang, LL (Zhang, Liangliang) ; Zhu, J (Zhu, Josh) ; Fang, SY (Fang, Shiyuan) ; Cheng, T (Cheng, Tim) ; Hong, C (Hong, Chloe) ; Shah, NH (Shah, Nigam H.)

By focusing on estimating the incremental value of a touch point and spill-over effects across channels, attribution models can provide insights for allocating marketing investments across channels and targeting customers across channels and devices.

Although advanced attribution models have been introduced in academia and practice alike, generalizable insights on channel effectiveness in multichannel settings, and on the interplay of channels, are still lacking. In response, the authors introduce a novel attribution framework reflecting the sequential nature of customer paths as first- and higher-order Markov walks. Applying this framework to four large customer-level data sets from various industries, each entailing at least seven distinct online channels, allows for deriving empirical generalizations and industry-related insights. The results show substantial differences from currently applied heuristics such as last click attribution, confirming and refining previous research on singular data sets. Moreover, the authors identify idiosyncratic channel preferences (carryover) and interaction effects both within and across channel categories (spillover). In this way, the study can help advertisers develop integrated online marketing strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, these standard online advertising metrics are plagued with attribution problems and do not account for synergy or dynamics. These issues can easily lead firms to overspend on some actions and thus waste money and/or underspend in others, leaving money on the table. We develop a multivariate time series model to investigate the dynamic interaction between paid search and display ads and calibrate the model using data from a bank that uses online ads to acquire new checking account customers. The model suggests that both search and display ads exhibit dynamics that improve their effectiveness and ROI over time. Moreover, our results suggest that display ads increase search conversion. However, display ads may also increase search clicks, thereby increasing search advertising costs. After accounting for these three effects, we estimate that each $1 invested in display and search leads to a return of $1.24 for display and $1.75 for search ads. These ROI estimates are respectively 10% and 38% higher than those obtained by standard metrics, which may have led the company to under-invest. We use these results to show how optimal budget allocation may shift after accounting for attribution and dynamics. Although display benefits from synergy attribution, the strong dynamic effects of search call for an increase in search advertising budget share by up to 36% in our context. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

How do these different topics affect company performance? And which specific marketing communication (online, TV, radio, print) obtains most of its performance impact by stimulating eWOM topics? This paper quantifies the dynamic interactions among marketing, eWOM content, search, and online and offline store traffic for an apparel retailer. While it yields a similar online store traffic lift, advertising-related eWOM yields only half the offline store traffic lift of brand-related eWOM and of neutral eWOM about purchasing at the retailer. Paid search shows the highest elasticity in stimulating online conversations, but drives less business than offline marketing actions. While TV is the main paid driver of online store traffic, print is the main paid driver of offline store traffic for the studied retailer. Over a third of the offline store traffic effects materialize indirectly through eWOM and organic search. To avoid undercounting the benefits of paid marketing, managers should therefore track how their actions induce specific eWOM content metrics and how much these in turn drive performance.

The search process is usually not observed, which creates econometric challenges. I show that inventory and the availability of different package sizes create new sources of variation to identify search costs in storable goods markets. To evaluate the importance of costly search in these markets, I estimate a dynamic choice model with search frictions using data on purchases of laundry detergent. My estimates show that consumers incur significant search costs, and ignoring costly search overestimates the own-price elasticity for products more often present in consideration sets and underestimates the elasticity of frequently excluded products. Firms employ marketing devices, such as product displays and advertising, to influence consideration sets. These devices have direct and strategic effects, which I explore using the estimates of the model.

They may bear the uncertainty and purchase the product without deliberation. Alternatively, consumers can incur a deliberation cost to find out their true valuation and then make their purchase decision. This paper proposes that consumer deliberation about product valuation can be an endogenous mechanism to enable credible quality signaling. We demonstrate this point in a simple setup in which product quality influences the probability that the product has high valuation. We show that with endogenous deliberation there may exist a unique separating equilibrium in which the high-quality firm induces consumer deliberation by setting a high price whereas the low-quality firm prevents deliberation by charging a low price. Compared to the case of complete information, the price of the high-quality firm can be distorted upward to facilitate consumer deliberation, or distorted downward to avoid the low-quality firm's imitation. In an extension we show that dissipative advertising can facilitate quality signaling. The high-quality firm can utilize advertising spending to avert imitation from the low-quality firm without distorting price downward, earning a higher profit than that without advertising. However, advertising mitigates the distortion at the expense of consumer surplus and social welfare.","Authors":"Guo, L (Guo, Liang) ; Wu, Y (Wu, Yue)","Title":"Consumer deliberation and quality signaling"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000384326900023 PubMed ID: 26371111 ISSN: 0964-4563 eISSN: 1468-3318","Keywords":"Advertising and Promotion; Social marketing; Media KeyWords Plus:SMOKING; ADOLESCENTS; INITIATION; EXPOSURE; MOVIES; YOUTH","Categories":"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health Web of Science Categories:Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Journal Information":"TOBACCO CONTROL Volume: 25 Issue: 5 Pages: 587-590 DOI: 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2015-052286 Published: SEP 2016","Abstract":"Objective To assess whether tobacco content found in video games was appropriately labelled for tobacco-related content by the Entertainment and Software Ratings Board (ESRB).

Issues that were analyzed included their classification of these disorders, the presumed etiology of such problems, and the types of treatment offered. Results. Over two-thirds of the 255 dental providers identified who advertised management of TMDs on their websites were general dentists. TMDs were attributed to occlusal problems or malocclusion on 66.7% of the websites and were labeled as a single disorder rather than a group of disorders on 38.8% of the websites. Recommendations to treat occlusal problems or malocclusion to alleviate TMDs were made by 54.5% of the providers. Conclusions. Since these findings are not in line with current concepts about TMDs, significant inaccuracies exist with regard to the diagnosis and management of TMDs on dental practice websites. Therefore, patients need to be concerned about the dentists they may select to get their treatment, and practitioners need to be prepared to deal with the issues raised by misinformed patients.","Authors":"Desai, B (Desai, Bhavik) ; Alkandari, N (Alkandari, Naser) ; Laskin, DM (Laskin, Daniel M.)","Title":"How accurate is information about diagnosis and management of temporomandibular disorders on dentist websites?"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000380146000006 ISSN: 1051-1253 eISSN: 1745-9117","Categories":"Criminology & Penology Web of Science Categories:Criminology & Penology","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE EDUCATION Volume: 27 Issue: 3 Pages: 362-380 DOI: 10.1080/10511253.2016.1142590 Published: SEP 2016","Abstract":"Individuals seeking academic employment opportunities often do so by exploring hiring announcements that are advertised online through Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences, American Society of Criminology, and The Chronicle of Higher Education.

Whereas optimizing parallel programs and distributed server systems have historically focused on average latency and throughput, the primary metric for interactive applications is instead consistent responsiveness, i.e., minimizing the number of requests that miss a target latency. This paper is the first to show how to generalize work-stealing, which is traditionally used to minimize the makespan of a single parallel job, to optimize for a target latency in interactive services with multiple parallel requests. We design a new adaptive work stealing policy, called tail-control, that reduces the number of requests that miss a target latency. It uses instantaneous request progress, system load, and a target latency to choose when to parallelize requests with stealing, when to admit new requests, and when to limit parallelism of large requests. We implement this approach in the Intel Thread Building Block (TBB) library and evaluate it on real-world workloads and synthetic workloads. The tail-control policy substantially reduces the number of requests exceeding the desired target latency and delivers up to 58% relative improvement over various baseline policies. This generalization of work stealing for multiple requests effectively optimizes the number of requests that complete within a target latency, a key metric for interactive services.","Authors":"Li, J (Li, Jing) ; Agrawal, K (Agrawal, Kunal) ; Elnikety, S (Elnikety, Sameh) ; He, YX (He, Yuxiong) ; Lee, ITA (Lee, I-Ting Angelina) ; Lu, CY (Lu, Chenyang) ; McKinley, KS (McKinley, Kathryn S.)","Title":"Work Stealing for Interactive Services to Meet Target Latency"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000383692200001 ISSN: 0022-2437 eISSN: 1547-7193","Keywords":"advertising; internet marketing; field experiments; randomized experiments; consumer memory and advertising KeyWords Plus:CONSIDERATION SETS; BRAND EVALUATIONS; COMPETING BRANDS; MODEL; SALES; INFORMATION; INDUSTRY; DEMAND; CHOICE; RECALL","Categories":"Business & Economics Web of Science Categories:Business","Journal Information":"JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH Volume: 53 Issue: 4 Pages: 459-478 DOI: 10.1509/jmr.14.0274 Published: AUG 2016","Abstract":"The author analyzes the impact of online ads on the advertiser's competitors, using data from randomized field experiments on a restaurant-search website.

The extent of spillovers also depends on the intensity of the advertising effort. The spillovers are largest when the intensity (frequency) of advertising is low. As the intensity increases, the spillovers disappear and the advertiser gains more sales. These patterns are consistent with the following mechanism: ads increase the chance of consumers buying the advertised product but also remind consumers of similar (nonadvertised) options.

The latter includes watching history, preferences for IPTV content and watching rate, which are periodically (e.g., weekly) published on a semi-trusted server (e.g., cloud server) along with anonymized demographics. Since the published data may leak sensitive information about subscribers, it is safeguarded using cryptographic techniques in addition to the anonymization of demographics. The techniques used by the advertiser, which can be manifested in its queries to the server, are considered (trade) secrets and therefore are protected as well. The server is oblivious to the published data and the queries of the advertiser as well as its own responses to these queries. Only a legitimate advertiser, endorsed with so-called trapdoors by the IPTV, can query the cloud server and access the query results. Even when some background information about users is available, query responses do not leak sensitive information about the IPTV users. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated with experiments, which show that the scheme is practical. The algorithms demonstrate both weak and strong scaling property and take advantage of high level of parallelism. The scheme can also be applied as a recommendation system.","Authors":"Khayati, LJ (Khayati, Leyli Javid) ; Orencik, C (Orencik, Cengiz) ; Savas, E (Savas, Erkay) ; Ustaoglu, B (Ustaoglu, Berkant)","Title":"A practical privacy-preserving targeted advertising scheme for IPTV users"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000381001600017 ISSN: 0013-5194 eISSN: 1350-911X","Categories":"Engineering Web of Science Categories:Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Journal Information":"ELECTRONICS LETTERS Volume: 52 Issue: 15 Pages: 1306-1307 DOI: 10.1049/el.2016.0415 Published: JUL 21 2016","Abstract":"An improved decision mechanism to the previously advertised correlation power analysis (CPA) type of attack which is applied on the Montgomery ladder exponentiation steps of the Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) RSA implementation is proposed.

As a novelty, proposed method uses this property; namely, it searches the closest matching between these ratios to decide the correct bit type vector.

We also shed light on how retailers vary in their propensity to violate MAP policies, and the depth by which they do so. Our inductive research approach documents managerial wisdom about MAP practices. We confront these insights from practice with a large empirical study that includes hundreds of products sold through hundreds of retailers. Consistent with managerial wisdom, we find that authorized retailers are more likely to comply with MAP than are unauthorized partners. By contrast to managerial wisdom, we find that authorized and unauthorized markets are largely separate, and that violations in the authorized channel have a small association with violations in the unauthorized channel.

This paper applies the economic framework of incentive contracts to study how these pricing models can lead to risk sharing between the publisher and the advertiser and incentivize them to make efforts that improve the performance of online ads. We find that, compared with the CPC model, the CPA model can better incentivize the publisher to make efforts that can improve the purchase rate. However, the CPA model can cause an adverse selection problem: the winning advertiser tends to have a lower profit margin under the CPA model than under the CPC model. We identify the conditions under which the CPA model leads to higher publisher (or advertiser) payoffs than the CPC model. Whether publishers (or advertisers) prefer the CPA model over the CPC model depends on the advertisers' risk aversion, uncertainty in the product market, and the presence of advertisers with low immediate sales ratios. Our findings indicate a conflict of interest between publishers and advertisers in their preferences for these two pricing models. We further consider which pricing model offers greater social welfare.","Authors":"Hu, Y (Hu, Yu (Jeffrey)) ; Shin, J (Shin, Jiwoong) ; Tang, ZL (Tang, Zhulei)","Title":"Incentive Problems in Performance-Based Online Advertising Pricing: Cost per Click vs. Cost per Action"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000378342100021 PubMed ID: 26001697 ISSN: 0964-4563 eISSN: 1468-3318","Categories":"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health Web of Science Categories:Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Journal Information":"TOBACCO CONTROL Volume: 25 Issue: 4 Pages: 480-482 DOI: 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2014-052032 Published: JUL 2016","Abstract":"Objectives This study examined how effectively current policy measures control depictions of tobacco in Mongolian language YouTube videos.

We develop an integrative conceptual framework that links marketing actions to online consumer activity metrics along the consumer's path to purchase (P2P). Our framework proposes that the path to purchase has three basic stages-learning (cognitive), feeling (affective), behavior (conative)-and that these can be measured with novel online consumer activity metrics such as clicking on a paid search ads (cognitive) or Facebook likes and unlikes of the brand (affective). Our empirical analysis of a fast moving consumer good supports a know-feel-do pathway for the low-involvement product studied. We find, for example, that earned media can drive sales. However, we find that the news is not all good as it relates to online consumer activity: higher consumer activity on earned and owned media can lead to consumer disengagement in the form of unlikes. While traditional marketing such as distribution (60%) and price (20%) are the main drivers of sales variation for the studied brand, online owned (10%), (un)earned (3%), and paid (2%) media explain a substantial part of the path to purchase. It is noteworthy that TV advertising (5%) explains significantly less than online media in our case. Overall, our study should help strengthen marketers' case for building share in consumers' hearts and minds, as measured through consumer online activity and engagement.","Authors":"Srinivasan, S (Srinivasan, Shuba) ; Rutz, OJ (Rutz, Oliver J.) ; Pauwels, K (Pauwels, Koen)","Title":"Paths to and off purchase: quantifying the impact of traditional marketing and online consumer activity"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Review Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000377330300001 PubMed ID: 27278656 ISSN: 1471-2458","Categories":"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health Web of Science Categories:Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Journal Information":"BMC PUBLIC HEALTH Volume: 16 Article Number: 465 DOI: 10.1186/s12889-016-3116-8 Published: JUN 9 2016","Abstract":"Background: Restricting marketing of alcoholic products is purported to be a cost-effective intervention to reduce alcohol consumption. The strength of evidence supporting this claim is contested. This systematic review aimed to assess immediate effects of exposure to alcohol marketing on alcoholic beverage consumption and related cognitions. Methods: Electronic searches of nine databases, supplemented with reference list searches and forward citation tracking, were used to identify randomised, experimental studies assessing immediate effects of exposure to alcohol marketing communications on objective alcohol consumption (primary outcome), explicit or implicit alcohol-related cognitions, or selection without purchasing (secondary outcomes). Study limitations were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Random and fixed effects meta-analyses were conducted to estimate effect sizes. Results: Twenty four studies met the eligibility criteria. A meta-analysis integrating seven studies (758 participants, all students) found that viewing alcohol advertisements increased immediate alcohol consumption relative to viewing non-alcohol advertisements (SMD = 0.20, 95 % CI = 0.05, 0.34). A meta-analysis integrating six studies (631 participants, all students) did not find that viewing alcohol portrayals in television programmes or films increased consumption (SMD = 0.16, 95 % CI = -0.05, 0.37). Meta-analyses of secondary outcome data found that exposure to alcohol portrayals increased explicit alcohol-related cognitions, but did not find that exposure to alcohol advertisements influenced explicit or implicit alcohol-related cognitions. Confidence in results is diminished by underpowered analyses and unclear risk of bias. Conclusions: Viewing alcohol advertisements (but not alcohol portrayals) may increase immediate alcohol consumption by small amounts, equivalent to between 0.39 and 2.67 alcohol units for males and between 0.25 and 1.69 units for females. The generalizability of this finding beyond students and to other marketing channels remains to be established.","Authors":"Stautz, K (Stautz, Kaidy) ; Brown, KG (Brown, Kyle G.) ; King, SE (King, Sarah E.) ; Shemilt, I (Shemilt, Ian) ; Marteau, TM (Marteau, Theresa M.)

Instead, when consumers recognize that the marketer has made an inference about their identity in order to serve them the ad, the ad itself functions as an implied social label. Across four studies, behaviorally targeted ads lead consumers to make adjustments to their self-perceptions to match the implied label; these self-perceptions then impact behavior including purchase intentions for the advertised product and other behaviors related to the implied label. Importantly, these effects only hold when the label is plausibly connected to consumers' prior behavior (i. e., when the targeting is at least moderately accurate).","Authors":"Summers, CA (Summers, Christopher A.) ; Smith, RW (Smith, Robert W.) ; Reczek, RW (Reczek, Rebecca Walker)","Title":"An Audience of One: Behaviorally Targeted Ads as Implied Social Labels"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:Spanish Accession Number: WOS:000391236700016 ISSN: 1989-3469","Keywords":"City; Digital screen; Outdoors advertising; Gran Via; Plaza Callao Square; Revitalization; Urban space; Public space KeyWords Plus:SIGNAGE","Categories":"Social Sciences - Other Topics Web of Science Categories:Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary","Journal Information":"PRISMA SOCIAL Issue: 16 Pages: 597-649 Published: JUN-NOV 2016","Abstract":"The aim of this research is to determinate the different reasons of the rise of digital outdoor advertising in the madrilian Gran Via through digital screens and analyze the functions and effects on it.

Classifying online marketing channels along the dimensions of contact origin and brand usage uncovers several meaningful interaction effects between contacts across channel types.

This paper summarizes and compares wearable fitness devices, also called \"fitness trackers\" or \"activity trackers.\" These devices are becoming increasingly popular in personal healthcare, motivating people to exercise more throughout the day without the need for lifestyle changes. The various choices in the market for wearable devices are also increasing, with customers searching for products that best suit their personal needs. Further, using a wearable device or fitness tracker can help people reach a fitness goal or finish line. Generally, companies display advertising for these kinds of products and depict them as beneficial, user friendly, and accurate. However, there are no objective research results to prove the veracity of their words. This research features subjective and objective experimental results, which reveal that some devices perform better than others. Methods: The four most popular wristband style wearable devices currently on the market (Withings Pulse, Misfit Shine, Jawbone Up24, and Fitbit Flex) are selected and compared. The accuracy of fitness tracking is one of the key components for fitness tracking, and some devices perform better than others. This research shows subjective and objective experimental results that are used to compare the accuracy of four wearable devices in conjunction with user friendliness and satisfaction of 7 real users. In addition, this research matches the opinions between reviewers on an Internet site and those of subjects when using the device. Results: Withings Pulse is the most friendly and satisfactory from the users' viewpoint.

Hence, it does not need to be registered with the National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau. Conclusion: GC Tea has benefits in reducing risk of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity. GC Tea also has antioxidant properties that help reduce risk of cancer. Only mild adverse effects were reported when consuming these herbs in recommended dose.","Authors":"Abdullah, SS (Abdullah, Siti Syarihan) ; Alkhoshaiban, AS (Alkhoshaiban, Ali Saleh) ; Mani, V (Mani, Vasudevan) ; Akkawi, ME (Akkawi, Muhammad Eid) ; Ming, LC (Ming, Long Chiau) Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number Ming, Long Chiau  J-5210-2015 http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6971-1383","Title":"Safety and efficacy of herbal tea for patients with diabetes mellitus"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Review Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000378401500003 ISSN: 2320-5210 eISSN: 2045-080X","Keywords":"Acai berry ABC; adulterated product; safety; sibutramine KeyWords Plus:RANDOMIZED TRIAL; DOUBLE-BLIND; SIBUTRAMINE; METAANALYSIS; INTERNET","Categories":"Pharmacology & Pharmacy Web of Science Categories:Pharmacology & Pharmacy","Journal Information":"ARCHIVES OF PHARMACY PRACTICE Volume: 7 Issue: 5 Pages: 11-15 Supplement: 1 DOI: 10.4103/2045-080X.183031 Published: MAY 2016","Abstract":"Purpose: The aim of this review is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a product named acai berry ABC and to understand the marketing issues implemented by this product.

Besides that, an electronic search was conducted through searching at Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed to assess the safety and efficacy of the product. Malaysia Advertisement Board was referred to evaluate the marketing issue in acai berry ABC. Results: According to Pharmaceutical Division Services, Ministry of Health, acai berry ABC is listed under product adulterated with poison which is contained sibutramine as an active ingredient which is against the Sale of Drugs Act 1952. Acai berry ABC widely advertised throughout social media such as Facebook, website services, and online marketing. Thus, there are a few issues related to marketing that against the Medicine Advertisement Board. Moreover, a review on safety and efficacy of sibutramine reported that sibutramine is effective in weight loss and it also may increase slightly in blood pressure (BP). Sibutramine should be used cautiously in patients with borderline or high BP. However, the Sibutramine Cardiovascular Outcome Trial (SCOUT) trial showed that long-term use of sibutramine among the subject with cardiovascular disease had a risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke, but not of cardiovascular death or death from any cause. Due to SCOUT trial, physician and pharmacist are recommended by the European Medicine Agency have to stop selling products containing sibutramine. Malaysia also banned this product since 2010. However, still there is a company selling the herbal weight loss product adulterated with sibutramine such as acai berry ABC. Conclusions: Ministry of Health has banned the selling of acai berry ABC in Malaysia due to adulteration with sibutramine which may risk and harmful to cardiovascular disease patient. As for Malaysian, it is not safe to consume the product that contains with control poison without consultation from physician or pharmacist. It is a pharmacist responsibility to educate people to consume an only product that registered with Ministry of Health. Malaysian should always consult with a physician or pharmacist if any confusion regarding any product that they have been consumed.","Authors":"Ibrahim, S (Ibrahim, Saliza) ; Yee, JCW (Yee, June Choon Wai) ; Gupta, M (Gupta, Manish) ; Murugiah, MK (Murugiah, Muthu Kumar) ; Ming, LC (Ming, Long Chiau) Hide ResearcherID and ORCIDView ResearcherID and ORCID Author ResearcherID ORCID Number Ming, Long Chiau  J-5210-2015 http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6971-1383","Title":"Safety and efficacy of health supplement for weight loss"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Review Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000378401500005 ISSN: 2320-5210 eISSN: 2045-080X","Keywords":"Appetite; \"Garcinia cambogia\"; \"hydroxycitric acid\"; hypolipidemic effect; obesity KeyWords Plus:(-)-HYDROXYCITRIC ACID; HYDROXYCITRIC ACID; DOUBLE-BLIND; BODY-WEIGHT; EXTRACT; OBESITY; TRIAL","Categories":"Pharmacology & Pharmacy Web of Science Categories:Pharmacology & Pharmacy","Journal Information":"ARCHIVES OF PHARMACY PRACTICE Volume: 7 Issue: 5 Pages: 22-28 Supplement: 1 DOI: 10.4103/2045-080X.183033 Published: MAY 2016","Abstract":"Aim: The aim of this study is to assess the uses of products containing Garcinia cambogia to burn fat and suppressed the appetite.

It is a fundamental component of numerous applications in digital marketing. McKinsey & Company view online user profiling as one of the promising opportunities companies should take advantage of to unlock \"big data's\" potential. This paper proposes a modeling approach that uncovers individual user profiles from online surfing data and allows online businesses to make profile predictions when limited information is available. The approach is easily parallelized and scales well for processing massive records of user online activity. We demonstrate application of our approach to customer-base analysis and display advertising. Our empirical analysis uncovers easy-to-interpret behavior profiles and describes the distribution of such profiles. Furthermore, it reveals that even for information-rich online firms profile inference that is based solely on their internal data may produce biased results. We find that although search engines cover smaller portions of consumer Web visits than major advertising networks, their data is of higher quality. Thus, even with the smaller information set, search engines can effectively recover consumer behavioral profiles. We also show that temporal limitations imposed on individual-level tracking abilities are likely to have a differential impact across major online businesses, and that our approach is particularly effective for temporally limited data. Using economic simulation we demonstrate potential gains the proposed model may offer a firm if used in individual-level targeting of display ads.","Authors":"Trusov, M (Trusov, Michael) ; Ma, LY (Ma, Liye) ; Jamal, Z (Jamal, Zainab)","Title":"Crumbs of the Cookie: User Profiling in Customer-Base Analysis and Behavioral Targeting"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000377196600032 ISSN: 1380-7501 eISSN: 1573-7721","Keywords":"YouTube; View sources; View diversity; View growth; Recommendation system; Referrer videos; Search; Highlight KeyWords Plus:POPULARITY","Categories":"Computer Science; Engineering Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic","Journal Information":"MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS Volume: 75 Issue: 10 Pages: 6035-6058 DOI: 10.1007/s11042-015-3206-0 Published: MAY 2016","Abstract":"As the largest video sharing site around the world, YouTube has been changing the way people entertain, gain popularity, and advertise. Discovering the major sources that drive views to a video and understanding how they impact the view growth pattern have become interesting topics for researchers as well as advertisers, media companies, or anyone who wish to have a shortcut to stardom. The work of this paper is to identify three major view sources, related video recommendation, YouTube search, and video highlight such as popular video list on YouTube homepage or video embedding on social networking sites, and examine the patterns of views from each view source. First, the impact of each view source on the view diversity and on the view share of each individual video is analyzed. It is found that while search and highlight create an effect of rich-get-richer, the related video recommendation equalizes the view distribution and helps users find niche videos. Second, the contribution of the three view sources to video popularity growth is investigated. The investigation reveals that search and related video recommendation are the two major sources that persistently drive views to a video. The view rates from recommendation and search are generally stabilized to be constant view rates. Third, the underlying factors that affect the long-term view rate from referrer videos are explored. The results indicate that the top referrer video set of a video is fairly stable and the view rate from recommendation is mainly determined by view rates of top referrer videos. Finally, whether highlight increases the view rate of a video after the duration of promotion is studied. The observations suggest that video highlight does not directly impact the view rate of a video after the event finishes. The findings presented in the paper provide several key insights into the impact and patterns of view contributions for each major source of the video views.","Authors":"Zhou, RJ (Zhou, Renjie) ; Khemmarat, S (Khemmarat, Samamon) ; Gao, LX (Gao, Lixin) ; Wan, J (Wan, Jian) ; Zhang, JL (Zhang, Jilin)","Title":"How YouTube videos are discovered and its impact on video views"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000376350700050 PubMed ID: 26377513 ISSN: 1462-2203 eISSN: 1469-994X","Categories":"Substance Abuse; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health Web of Science Categories:Substance Abuse; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Journal Information":"NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH Volume: 18 Issue: 5 Pages: 864-868 DOI: 10.1093/ntr/ntv190 Published: MAY 2016","Abstract":"Introduction: Although cigar use and sales have increased in the United States over the past decade, little is known about how these products are promoted. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising is a common method used to promote tobacco products and may be a potential channel through which cigars are advertised. Methods: Comperemedia (Mintel) was used to acquire opt-in direct mail and email advertising for the top 10 cigar brands in the United States between January 2013 and July 2014. The advertisement and corresponding data on brand, advertising spend, and mail volume were downloaded and summarized. Promotions such as coupons, giveaways, and sweepstakes were also examined. Results: A total of 92 unique advertisements met the search criteria and included two brands: Black & Mild (n = 77) and Swisher Sweets (n = 15). Expenditures on direct mail advertising during this period totaled $12 809 630. Black & Mild encompassed 80% of total direct mail volume and 78% of direct mail advertising expenditures. Almost all advertisements contained at least one promotion (88%) and included a URL to the product website (85%). Conclusions: The results suggest that Black & Mild and Swisher Sweets are the primary cigar brands using DTC advertising. Promotional offers were nearly ubiquitous among the advertisements, which may appeal to price-sensitive populations. Future studies should continue to examine cigar advertising via direct mail and email, in addition to other channels, such as the point-of-sale. Implications: Although cigar use and sales have increased in the United States over the past decade, there is limited data on cigar advertising.

However, a huge amount of time spending on the Internet advertising somehow brings users uncomfortable viewing experience rather than effectively generates high consumption of advertised products. Therefore, it is urgent to find a viewer-friendly and advertiser-beneficial solution to launch ads. This paper is the first attempt to improve the effectiveness of advertising through combining online shopping information with an ad video and directing viewers to proper online shopping places. The proposed ActiveAd framework includes four main components. Firstly, an ad video analysis component detects both syntactic and semantic elements from ad videos, e.g. FMPIs (Frame Marked with Production Information), visual concepts, and textual keywords within the ad videos. Our ad video analysis provides a comprehensive solution to extract meaningful elements from ad videos. Secondly, a visual linking by search component is proposed to collect websites which contain similar images as FMPIs. Features used for the visual search are weighted and fused in order to ensure the uniformity of search results. Thirdly, different kinds of tags and product categories extracted from collected websites are aggregated in order to identify the representative text of the product. Finally, query keywords are selected through calculating cosine similarity from two kinds of keywords, i.e. keywords identified from tag aggregation and keywords obtained through ad video analysis (visual concept detection and textual keyword detection). A query vector is generated by selected keywords and used to retrieve product online. In this paper, a powerful cross-media contextual search including visual search, tag aggregation and textual search is achieved with the help of ad video analysis. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed ActiveAd achieves product recommendation effectively and efficiently. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Some authors blame advertising and the availability of more convenient formulations whilst other have pointed out that the routine testing of men with erectile dysfunction (a significant marker of cardiovascular risk) and those with diabetes would inevitably increase the diagnosis of hypogonadism and lead to an increase in totally appropriate prescribing. They commented that this was merely an appropriate correction of previous underdiagnosis and undertreatment by adherence to evidence-based guidelines. Urologists and primary care physicians are the most frequent initiators of TRT, usually for erectile dysfunction. Benefits are clearly established for sexual function, increase in lean muscle mass and strength, mood and cognitive function, with possible reduction in frailty and osteoporosis. There remains no evidence that TRT is associated with increased risk of prostate cancer or symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia, yet the decision to initiate and continue therapy is often decided by urologists. The cardiovascular issues associated with TRT have been clarified by recent studies showing clearly that therapy associated with clear rise in testosterone levels are associated with reduced mortality. Studies reporting to show increased risk have been subject to flawed designs with inadequate baseline diagnosis and follow-up testing. Effectively they have compared nontreated patients with undertreated or on-compliant subjects involving a range of different therapy regimens. Recent evidence suggests long acting injections may be associated with decreased cardiovascular risk but the transdermal route may be associated with potentially relatively greater risk because of conversion to dihydrotestosterone by the effect of 5 alpha reductase in skin. The multiple effects of TRT may add up to a considerable benefit to the patient that might be underestimated by the physician primarily concerned with his own specialty. This paper will attempt to identify who should be treated, and how they should be treated safely to achieve best outcomes, based on a comprehensive MEDLINE and EMBASE and Cochrane searches on hypogonadism, TRT and cardiovascular safety from May 2005 to May 2015.

In such context, those clinics communicate directly with consumers (patients and their family members) via the clinics' websites. Meanwhile, the Health Science Council at the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan has pointed out noncompliance of some local clinics with the provisions concerning medical advertising in the Medical Care Act in the past. However, locally little is known about the current status of those clinics including the quality of their webpage information disseminated. Objective: To evaluate the quality of website information of private-practice clinics offering cell therapies in Japan. Methods: Twenty-four websites with 77 treatments from the Google search were identified for evaluation. The following three exploratory analyses were performed: first in order to ascertain web-based portrayal of private-practice clinics offering cell therapies, a descriptive analysis was conducted using a coding frame; second we evaluated the quality of the target website information from the viewpoint of the level of consideration taken for patients and their family members, using 10 quality criteria (\"the Minimum Standard\") from the e-Health Code of Ethics 2.0; third we counted and coded expressions that matched set categories for \"name-dropping\" and \"personalized medicine\" in the information posted on these websites. Results: Analysis on the treatments (N=77) revealed 126 indications (multiple response): the top three indications were \"cancer,\" \"skin-rejuvenation/antiaging/anti-skin aging,\" and \"breast augmentation/buttock augmentation.\" As for the portrayal of treatment risks and benefits, 78% (60/77) of treatments were mentioned with \"benefits,\" whereas 77% (59/77) of treatments were mentioned with \"risks.\" As for the source(s) cited for the discussions of treatment risks and benefits, no treatment quoted an expert's opinion for the risks, whereas 7% (6/77) treatments quoted external sources for the benefits. As for the results with e-Health Code of Ethics 2.0, not a single clinic fulfilled all the 10 criteria; 63% (15/24) of the clinics was found exercising \" name-dropping,\" and 21% (5/24) of the clinics mentioned expressions related to \"personalized medicine\" on their websites. Conclusions: Our website content analyses confirmed the following: (1) the clinics mentioned the risks or benefits of the treatments with hardly any scientific citations, (2) the way the website information was disseminated was inappropriate for patients and their families, and (3) many websites seemed to be using marketing techniques in order to draw patients' interests or attentions. It is important that more similar studies are undertaken globally to enable an orchestrated regulatory approach toward private-practice clinics.","Authors":"Kashihara, H (Kashihara, Hidenori) ; Nakayama, T (Nakayama, Takeo) ; Hatta, T (Hatta, Taichi) ; Takahashi, N (Takahashi, Naomi) ; Fujita, M (Fujita, Misao)","Title":"Evaluating the Quality of Website Information of Private-Practice Clinics Offering Cell Therapies in Japan"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000375576700007 ISSN: 1533-5399 eISSN: 1557-6051","Keywords":"Economics; Experimentation; Measurement; Interconnection economics; premium service delivery; tussle analysis","Categories":"Computer Science Web of Science Categories:Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering","Journal Information":"ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET TECHNOLOGY Volume: 16 Issue: 2 Article Number: 14 DOI: 10.1145/2883610 Published: APR 2016","Abstract":"We have developed a novel methodology for deriving bandwidth prices for premium direct peering between Access ISPs (A-ISPs) and Content and Service Providers (CSPs) that want to deliver content and services in premium quality.

We analyze the U.S. market and derive prices for video, that compare favorably with existing prices for transit and paid peering. We also observe that the fair prices returned by the model for high-profit/low-volume services such as search, are orders of magnitude higher than current bandwidth prices. This implies that resolving existing (fierce) interconnection tussles may require per service, instead of wholesale, peering between A-ISPs and CSPs.

Manipulation is an important element of the strategy of communication and advertising in business. A large selection of competitive products and advertising noise make it increasingly difficult for a product to break through to customer awareness. On the one hand, advertising creates consumer attitudes and, on the other hand, the clutter of advertising and promotional announcements forces companies to search for more and more sophisticated ways to get to the customers and attract their attention. Advertisers reach for controversial themes, shocking with carefully selected images. Advertising starts to involve themes that used to be considered social taboos or at least they were the embarrassing ones, intimate or not-discussed openly in many cultures. Advertising functions as a mirror that reflects reality and, at the same time, it can shape the reality. Contemporary advertisements exhibit neutralisation of violence, pornography, attacking religious, and/or social values, often even forming the canon of a given culture.

The paper also empirically verifies the impact of chosen job-seeking strategies on the success or failure of their transition to employment. The study was Polish-wide and included graduates of geography. It consisted of two stages. The first stage (N = 1120) allowed the researcher to identify the most successful job search methods for university-to-work transition. These included: applying for vacancies advertised on the Internet and direct contact with employers. In the event of failure to find employment, graduates turned to more informal methods. The second stage (N = 375) supplied data which made it possible to learn about the graduates' status on the labour market 6 months after graduation. It also provided information on a structure of methods used by graduates which resulted in acquiring a job and evolution of job search methods in case of failure to perform transition to work. Discriminant function analysis was used to establish that the following job search methods are the best predictors of one's situation on the labour market: applying for vacancies advertised in the press and public employment agencies. Other variables were found not to be statistically significant in discriminating between the group of working and unemployed graduates.","Authors":"Pirog, D (Pirog, Danuta)","Title":"Job search strategies of recent university graduates in Poland: plans and effectiveness"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Article Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000371844800016 PubMed ID: 26792765 ISSN: 0195-6663 eISSN: 1095-8304","Keywords":"Adolescents; Health communication; Instagram; Online food communication; Photo food presentation; Social media KeyWords Plus:IMAGES; BEHAVIOR; CHILDREN; BLOGS","Categories":"Behavioral Sciences; Nutrition & Dietetics Web of Science Categories:Behavioral Sciences; Nutrition & Dietetics","Journal Information":"APPETITE Volume: 99 Pages: 121-129 DOI: 10.1016/j.appet.2016.01.009 Published: APR 1 2016","Abstract":"The study aimed to explore how adolescents communicate food images in a widely used social media image-sharing application. We examined how and in what context food was presented and the type of food items that were frequently portrayed by following a youth related hashtag on Instagram. The hashtag #14r (\"14 years\") was used to find adolescent users on Instagram: these users public photo streams were then searched for food items they had shared with others. Food items were identified and categorized based on type of food and how the food items were presented. Most of the adolescent users (85%) shared images containing food items. A majority of the images (67.7%) depicted foods high in calories but low in nutrients. Almost half of these images were arranged as a still life with food brand names clearly exposed. Many of these images were influenced by major food marketing campaigns. Fruits and vegetables occurred in 21.8% of all images. This food group was frequently portrayed zoomed in with focus solely on the food, with a hashtag or caption expressing palatability. These images were often presented in the style of a cook book. Food was thus presented in varied ways. Adolescents themselves produced images copying food advertisements. This has clear health promotion implications since it becomes more challenging to monitor and tackle young people's exposure to marketing of unhealthy foods in these popular online networks because images are part of a lifestyle that the young people want to promote. Shared images contain personal recommendations, which mean that they may have a more powerful effect than commercial advertising. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, it is important to systematically understand how specific elements of social media, signifying and representing behavioural manifestations of brand engagement, relate to other online activities. We study how three types of brand engagement on social media - affiliation, conversation and responsiveness - influence search engine advertising effectiveness, including click-through rate and conversion rate. Specifically, we find that affiliation, conversation and responsiveness increase click-through rate and conversion rate. Moreover, brand engagement on social media strengthens the relationships between advertisement rank and search engine advertising effectiveness.","Authors":"Yang, S (Yang, Shuai) ; Lin, S (Lin, Shan) ; Carlson, JR (Carlson, Jeffrey R.) ; Ross, WT (Ross, William T., Jr.)","Title":"Brand engagement on social media: will firms' social media efforts influence search engine advertising effectiveness?"}, {"Document Information":"Document Type:Review Language:English Accession Number: WOS:000371744200007 ISSN: 0265-0487 eISSN: 1759-3948","Keywords":"social network sites; advertising; web 2.0; research agenda; review; social media KeyWords Plus:CONSUMER-GENERATED ADS; NETWORKING SITES; FACEBOOK; INTERNET; BRAND; IMPACT; USERS; FANS; WEB; ADVERTISEMENTS","Categories":"Business & Economics; Communication Web of Science Categories:Business; Communication","Journal Information":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING Volume: 35 Issue: 2 Pages: 266-300 DOI: 10.1080/02650487.2015.1021898 Published: MAR 3 2016","Abstract":"This article presents an up-to-date review of academic and empirical research on advertising in social media.

In addition to challenges similar to those encountered in sponsored search advertising, such as data sparsity and cold start problems, more complicated feature interactions involving multi-aspects, such as the user, publisher and advertiser, make CTR estimation in RTB more difficult. We consider CTR estimation in RTB as a tensor complement problem and propose a fully coupled interactions tensor factorization (FCTF) model based on Tucker decomposition (TD) to model three pairwise interactions between the user, publisher and advertiser and ultimately complete the tensor complement task. FCTF is a special case of the Tucker decomposition model; however, it is linear in runtime for both learning and prediction. Different from pairwise interaction tensor factorization (PITF), which is another special case of TD, FCTF is independent from the Bayesian personalized ranking optimization algorithm and is applicable to generic third-order tensor decomposition with popular simple optimizations, such as the least square method or mean square error. In addition, we also incorporate all explicit information obtained from different aspects into the FCTF model to alleviate the impact of cold start and sparse data on the final performance. We compare the performance and runtime complexity of our method with Tucker decomposition, canonical decomposition and other popular methods for CTR prediction over real-world advertising datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that the improved model not only achieves better prediction quality than the others due to considering fully coupled interactions between three entities, user, publisher and advertiser but also can accomplish training and prediction with linear runtime.

A novel data set from a major Chinese online travel agency is used for analysis, consisting of four months of data with 24,337 store visits through three types of channels: direct visit, search advertising and referral. Results of a Bayesian multinomial logit model show that the search channel significantly affects consumers' conversion probability, and show a high degree of inertia in channel use. This finding contrasts sharply with suggestions of previous research that most future purchases will converge to the direct-visit channel.","Authors":"Zhang, ZL (Zhang, Zelin) ; Wang, X (Wang, Xia) ; Leszczyc, PTLP (Leszczyc, Peter T.
