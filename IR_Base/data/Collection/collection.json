Many studies have shown a central role for transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF beta-1) and its downstream signaling cascades in the pathogenesis of CKD. In this study, we have reanalyzed a microarray dataset to recognize critical signaling pathways controlled by TGF beta-1. Materials and Methods: This study is a bioinformatics reanalysis for a microarray data. The GSE23338 dataset was downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database which assesses the mRNA expression profile of TGF beta-1 treated human kidney cells after 24 and 48 hours incubation. The protein interaction networks for differentially expressed (DE) genes in both time points were constructed and enriched. In addition, by network topology analysis, genes with high centrality were identified and then pathway enrichment analysis was performed with either the total network genes or with the central nodes. Results: We found 110 and 170 genes differentially expressed in the time points 24 and 48 hours, respectively. As the genes in each time point had few interactions, the networks were enriched by adding previously known genes interacting with the differentially expressed ones. In terms of degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality parameters 62 and 60 nodes were considered to be central in the enriched networks of 24 hours and 48 hours treatment, respectively. Pathway enrichment analysis with the central nodes was more informative than those with all network nodes or even initial DE genes, revealing key signaling pathways. Conclusion: We introduced a method for the analysis of microarray data that integrates the expression pattern of genes with their topological properties in protein interaction networks. This holistic novel approach allows extracting knowledge from raw bulk omics data.","Author":"","Title":"Central Nodes in Protein Interaction Networks Drive Critical Functions in Transforming Growth Factor Beta-1 Stimulated Kidney Cells","ReviewID":"0","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"2.0","Content":"Drug-eluting stents have been used widely to prevent restenosis of arteries following percutaneous balloon angioplasty. Mathematical modelling plays an important role in optimising the design of these stents to maximise their efficiency. When designing a drug-eluting stent system, we expect to have a sufficient amount of drug being released into the artery wall for a sufficient period to prevent restenosis. In this paper, a simple model is considered to provide an elementary description of drug release into artery tissue from an implanted stent. From the model, we identified a parameter regime to optimise the system when preparing the polymer coating. The model provides some useful order of magnitude estimates for the key quantities of interest. From the model, we can identify the time scales over which the drug traverses the artery wall and empties from the polymer coating, as well as obtain approximate formulae for the total amount of drug in the artery tissue and the fraction of drug that has released from the polymer. The model was evaluated by comparing to in-vivo experimental data and good agreement was found.","Author":"","Title":"MODELLING CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY AFTER IMPLANTATION OF A DRUG-ELUTING STENT.

The meeting offered the opportunity for international scientists to share their viewpoints and recent outcomes concerning microbial stress responses. Particular attention was given to the characterisation of mechanisms triggered by stress, from detailed molecular biology through whole organism systems biology up to the level of populations. A deeper understanding of microbial responses to stress is indeed attainable only considering the phenomenon as a whole. Exhaustive knowledge of the various stress response systems, and of their interconnections, is important for different applications, from the prevention and counteraction of bacterial infectious diseases to the engineering of robust cell factories. The presentations covered all of these aspects, enabling an active interaction among participants. It also stimulated discussions and cross-fertilisation among disciplines, which was one of the aims of the meeting. Moreover, since many stress response mechanisms are broadly conserved, data obtained at the microbial scale may facilitate the comprehension of complex phenomena, such as aging, evolution of neurological diseases and cancer.

Abundant novel applications in synthetic biology were described in the six sessions of the meeting, which was divided into technology and tools for synthetic biology (I, II and III), bionanoscience, biosynthetic pathways and enzyme synthetic biology, and metabolic engineering and chemical manufacturing. The meeting presented numerous methods for the development of novel synthetic strains, synthetic biological tools and synthetic biology applications. With the aid of synthetic biology, production costs of chemicals, metabolites and food products are expected to decrease, by generating sustainable biochemical production of such resources. Also, such synthetic biological advances could be applied for medical purposes, as in pharmaceuticals and for biosensors. Recurrent, linked themes throughout the meeting were the shortage of resources, the world's transition into a bioeconomy, and how synthetic biology is helping tackle these issues through cutting-edge technologies. While there are still limitations in synthetic biology research, innovation is propelling the development of technology, the standardisation of synthetic biological tools and the use of suitable host organisms. These developments are laying a foundation to providing a future where cutting-edge research could generate potential solutions to society's pressing issues, thus incentivising a transition into a bioeconomy.

Commonly used geometric representations admit geometric singularities such as cusps, tips and self-intersecting facets that lead to computational instabilities in the molecular modeling. The present work explores the use of flexibility and rigidity index (FRI), which has a proved superiority in protein B-factor prediction, for biomolecular geometric representation and associated electrostatic analysis. FRI rigidity surfaces are free of geometric singularities. We proposed a rigidity based Poisson -Boltzmann equation for biomolecular electrostatic analysis. Our approaches to surface and electrostatic modeling are validated by a set of 21 proteins. Our results are compared with those of established methods. Finally, being smooth and analytically differentiable, FRI rigidity functions offer excellent curvature analysis, which characterizes concave and convex regions on protein surfaces. Polarized curvatures constructed by using the product of minimum curvature and electrostatic potential is shown to predict potential protein-ligand binding sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Materials and Methods: This experimental study evaluated the viability and morphology of MSCs in the presence of SNP (100 to 2000 mu M) at 1, 5, and 15 hours. We chose the 100, 1000, and 2000 mu M concentrations of SNP for one hour exposure for further analyses. Cell proliferation was investigated by the colony forming assay and population doubling number (PDN). Na+, K+, and Ca2+ levels as well as activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) were measured. Results: The viability of MSCs dose-dependently reduced from 750 mu M at one hour and 250 mu M at 5 and 15 hours. The 100 mu M caused no change in viability, however we observed a reduction in the cytoplasmic area at 5 and 15 hours. This change was not observed at one hour. The one hour treatment with 100 mu M of SNP reduced the mean colony numbers but not the diameter when the cells were incubated for 7 and 14 days. In addition, one hour treatment with 100 mu M of SNP significantly reduced ALT, AST, and ALP activities whereas the activity of LDH increased when incubated for 24 hours. The same treatment caused an increase in Ca2+ and reduction in Na+ content. The 1000 and 2000 mu M concentrations reduced all the factors except Ca2+ and LDH which increased. Conclusion: The high dose of SNP, even for a short time, was toxic. The low dose was safe with respect to viability and proliferation, especially over a short time. However elevated LDH activity might increase anaerobic metabolism.","Author":"","Title":"Sodium Nitroprusside Changed The Metabolism of Mesenchymal Stem Cells to An Anaerobic State while Viability and Proliferation Remained Intact","ReviewID":"6","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"2.0","Content":"Water, which is the habitat for a variety of living creatures, has a maximum density at 4.0 degrees C. This crucial property is considered to play a very important role in the biology of a lake and also has a close relationship with the areas of environmentology and geoscience. It would be desirable for students to confirm this important property of water themselves by carrying out simple experiments. However, it is not easy to detect the maximum density at 4.0 degrees C because the temperature dependence of the water density is very small close to its freezing point. For example, the density of water is 0.999 975 g cm(-3) at 4.0 degrees C and 0.999 850 g cm(-3) at 0.1 degrees C. The aim in this manuscript is to demonstrate a simple experiment to detect 4.0 degrees C as the temperature of maximum density, in which the time dependence of the water temperature is measured at several different depths by chilling the water surface. This is a simple experiment that can also be performed by high school students.

Por-ceria nanoparticles exhibited strong intrinsic peroxidase activity toward a classical peroxidase substrate, 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), in the presence of H2O2. Enhanced peroxidase-like activity of Por-ceria originated from synergistic effect of porphyrin and ceria, thereby explaining the high performance of Por-Ceria as an artificial enzyme mimicking peroxidase.

However field experiments can be difficult and expensive to conduct, with no guarantee that useable results will be produced. In this context, the development of mathematical models and numerical tools is crucial to improve the field experiments by suggesting relevant data which can be used to estimate parameters related to the pest's biology and to the traps (e.g. duration of the experiments, distance of the releases, etc.). Here we develop a trap-insect model (TIM), based on coupled partial differential equations. The model is studied theoretically and a finite element algorithm is developed and implemented. A protocol for parameter estimation is also proposed and tested, with various data. Among other results, we show that entomological knowledge is absolutely necessary for efficient estimation of parameters, in particular population size.

As ambient space, we can consider: bounded domains, periodic environments, transition problems, where the environment consists of a block of infinitesimal diffusion and an adjacent nonlocal one. In each of these cases, we analyze the existence/nonexistence of solutions in terms of the spectral properties of the domain.

The formulation involves systems of highly nonlinear partial differential equations of surface effects through diffuse-interface models [27]. Simulations of this practical model using numerical methods can be applied for evaluating it. The present paper investigates the solution of the tumor growth model with meshless techniques. Meshless methods are applied based on the collocation technique which employ multiquadrics (MQ) radial basis function (RBFs) and generalized moving least squares (GMLS) procedures. The main advantages of these choices come back to the natural behavior of meshless approaches. As well as, a method based on meshless approach can be applied easily for finding the solution of partial differential equations in high-dimension using any distributions of points on regular and irregular domains. The present paper involves a time-dependent system of partial differential equations that describes four-species tumor growth model. To overcome the time variable, two procedures will be used. One of them is a semi-implicit finite difference method based on Crank-Nicolson scheme and another one is based on explicit Runge-Kutta time integration. The first case gives a linear system of algebraic equations which will be solved at each time-step. The second case will be efficient but conditionally stable. The obtained numerical results are reported to confirm the ability of these techniques for solving the two and three-dimensional tumor-growth equations.

These exosomes can mediate communication between cells and affect various tumor-related processes in their target cells. We present a quantitative proteomics analysis of the exosomes purified from serum of patients with CRC and normal volunteers; data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD003875. We identified 918 proteins with an overlap of 725 Gene IDs in the Exocarta proteins list. Compared with the serum-purified exosomes (SPEs) of normal volunteers, we found 36 proteins upregulated and 22 proteins downregulated in the SPEs of CRC patients. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that upregulated proteins are involved in processes that modulate the pretumorigenic microenvironment for metastasis. In contrast, differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) that play critical roles in tumor growth and cell survival were principally downregulated. Our study demonstrates that SPEs of CRC patients play a pivotal role in promoting the tumor invasiveness, but have minimal influence on putative alterations in tumor survival or proliferation. According to bioinformatics analysis, we speculate that the protein contents of exosomes might be associated with whether they are involved in premetastatic niche establishment or growth and survival of metastatic tumor cells. This information will be helpful in elucidating the pathophysiological functions of tumor-derived exosomes, and aid in the development of CRC diagnostics and therapeutics.","Author":"","Title":"Protein content and functional characteristics of serum-purified exosomes from patients with colorectal cancer revealed by quantitative proteomics","ReviewID":"16","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"2.0","Content":"Explaining the evolution of cooperative behavior is one of the most important and interesting problems in a myriad of disciplines, such as evolutionary biology, mathematics, statistical physics, social science and economics Up to now, there have been a great number of works aiming to this issue with the help of evolutionary game theory.

A wealth of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping studies in sticklebacks have provided insight into longstanding questions about the distribution of effect sizes during adaptation as well as the role of genetic linkage in facilitating adaptation. These QTL mapping studies have also provided a basis for the identification of the genes that underlie phenotypic diversity. These data have revealed that mutations in regulatory elements play an important role in the evolution of phenotypic diversity in sticklebacks. Genetic and molecular studies in sticklebacks have also led to new insights on the genetic basis of repeated evolution and suggest that the same loci are involved about half of the time when the same phenotypes evolve independently.

Sir Richard Owen also took great care to highlight each of the elements of the forelimb and hindlimb in a multitude of species with focused attention on the homology between the hoof of the horse and the middle digit of man. The ensuing decades brought about a convergence of palaeontology, experimental embryology and molecular biology to lend further support to the homologies of tetrapod limbs and their developmental origins.

Current understanding of this topic is enriched by many disciplines, including anatomy, palaeontology, developmental biology, genetics and genomics. Development is central because it is the means by which genetic information of an organism is translated into morphology.

Recent approaches include imaging, quantitative morphometrics and, in particular, genomics, which brings a new dimension. Articles in this issue illustrate the contemporary evo-devo field by considering general principles emerging from genomics and how this and other approaches are applied to specific questions about the evolution of major transitions and innovations in morphology, diversification and modification of structures, intraspecific morphological variation and developmental plasticity.

The distinctions between homologous or non-homologous structures have become blurred, however, as modern evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) has shown that novel features often result from modification of pre-existing developmental modules, rather than arising completely de novo. With this realization in mind, the term 'deep homology' was coined, in recognition of the remarkably conserved gene expression during the development of certain animal structures that would not be considered homologous by previous strict definitions. At its core, it can help to formulate an understanding of deeper layers of ontogenetic conservation for anatomical features that lack any clear phylogenetic continuity. Here, we review deep homology and related concepts in the context of a gene expression-based homology discussion. We then focus on how these conceptual frameworks have profited from the recent rise of high-throughput next-generation sequencing. These techniques have greatly expanded the range of organisms amenable to such studies. Moreover, they helped to elevate the traditional gene-by-gene comparison to a transcriptome-wide level.

However, research on their biology, ecology and behaviour to develop management tactics is hampered by the lack of reliable attacks on experimental trees. Injecting Magnolia virginiana L. with ethanol consistently induced attacks by exotic ambrosia beetles to facilitate research on their biology and management. The ability to attract ambrosia beetles to trap trees may be useful for developing nonchemical strategies and techniques for managing them in nurseries. However, to be useful in management techniques, ethanol-injection has to reliably induce attacks on a vlariety of tree species. Experiments were conducted in Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia, where ethanol-injection was tested on 16 species of deciduous trees from 11 families. Ethanol-injection reliably induced attacks by exotic ambrosia beetles on all tree species tested. There were differences in the numbers of attacks by ambrosia beetles among species of trees in most experiments, although no species was identified consistently as the most or least attacked in repeated experiments. The positive association of attacks with ethanol concentrations in bark tissue indicate that the attack rates were most likely related to the uptake and emission of ethanol.

Laminin was immunolocalized in basement membranes surrounding seminiferous tubules, as well as in basement membranes associated with Leydig, peritubular myoid and vascular smooth muscle cells. Scalloped basement membranes enclosed seminiferous tubules in regressing testes. The seminiferous epithelium and interstitial tissue in all animals studied were cytokeratin immunonegative. Smooth muscle actin was demonstrated in vascular smooth muscle cells, as well as in peritubular myoid cells encircling seminiferous tubules. Vimentin immunoreactivity was exhibited in the cytoplasm of Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, vascular endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and fibrocytes. Vimentin immunostaining in Sertoli, Leydig and peritubular myoid cells varied depending on the functional state of the testis. The results of the study have shown that dramatic seasonal histological changes occur in the testes of the jackal. In addition, the use of immunohistochemistry accentuates these morphological changes.","Author":"","Title":"Seasonal Changes in the Immunolocalization of Cytoskeletal Proteins and Laminin in the Testis of the Black-Backed Jackal (Canis mesomelas)","ReviewID":"27","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"2.0","Content":"Background: Medullary thyroid carcinoma management consists mainly of surgical resection and is largely chemoresistant There is ongoing effort to discover novel therapies for medullary thyroid carcinoma. Increased levels of heat shock proteins have been associated with multiple cancers and are being studied as potential therapeutic targets. The purpose of this study was to determine the expression levels of heat shock proteins 90 and 70 and of glucose related protein 78 in medullary thyroid carcinoma tissues compared with normal thyroid tissues. Methods: 20 tissue specimens of medullary thyroid carcinoma and 10 specimens of thyroids without malignancy were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Results: Medullary thyroid carcinoma specimens showed 27% higher expression level of heat shock protein 90 immunostaining, and a 43% higher expression level of heat shock protein 70 immunostaining versus normal controls. These differences, however, were not statistically significant. A significantly higher expression level was noted for glucose related protein 78 in the medullary thyroid carcinoma specimens than in the controls. Conclusion: This study indicates increased expression levels of heat shock proteins 90 and 70 and glucose related protein 78 levels in medullary thyroid carcinoma. These findings, though preliminary imply that these proteins may have a role in medullary thyroid carcinoma's tumor biology and may have and future therapeutic options. Larger cohorts are needed to corroborate these results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

First, we draw upon spatial theory in the study of religion to examine three dimensions of minority faith buildings in England and what this tells us about the communities involved: location' (i.e. the geographical location of the buildings); space' (i.e. what the buildings are used for and their relationship to local, national and transnational scales); and place' (i.e. what types of buildings are selected by different communities and why). We then turn to theories of memory that have become popular within the study of religion as well as heritage studies.

The potential shifts inwomen's capacities to create spaces between pregnancies or to prevent future pregnancies have profound and often positive biological, demographic, and socioeconomic implications. Less acknowledged, however, are the ambivalences that women experience around contraception use-vacillations between moral frameworks, generational difference, and gendered forms of labor that have implications well beyond the boundaries of an individual's reproductive biology. This paper hones in on contraceptive use of culturally Tibetan women in two regions of highland Nepal whose reproductive lives occurred from 1943 to 2012. Methods We describe the experiences of the 296 women ( out of a study of more than 1000 women's reproductive histories) who used contraception, and under what circumstances, examining socioeconomic, geographic, and age differences as well as points of access and patterns of use. We also provide a longitudinal perspective on fertility. Results Our results relate contraception usage to fertility decline, as well as to differences in access between the two communities of women. Conclusions Weargue that despite seemingly similar social ecologies of these two study sites-including stated reasons for the adoption of contraception and expressed ambivalence around its use, someof which are linked to moral and cosmological understandings that emerge from Buddhism-the dynamics of contraception uptake in these two regions are distinct, as are, therefore, patterns of fertility transition.","Author":"","Title":"Closing the Womb Door: Contraception Use and Fertility Transition Among Culturally Tibetan Women in Highland Nepal","ReviewID":"10","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Consciousness and perception of reality are related to internal and external factors as the sum of collective and social interactions.

The perception of stigma attached to people with mental illness was elicited using Link's perceived discrimination and devaluation scale (PDDS) carried out in Vietnamese language. The survey sample (n=806) was stratified for gender, urban/rural location, age, household size and marital status, in accordance with the 2013 Vietnamese census.

Previous studies have shown that young people in rural Thailand have low levels of knowledge on HIV/AIDS and high sexual risks. We compared sexual behaviors between the lowland Thai youth and the youth from ethnic minority groups. Methods and findings This is a cross-sectional quantitative study conducted among high-school Thai and ethnic students in Chiang Mai. From a total 1215 participants, 487 (40.1%) were lowland Thai and 728 (59.9%) were from ethnic minorities. Overall, 17.9% of respondents reported \"ever had sex.\" Lowland Thai adolescents were more likely to have ever had sex compared with ethnic minority adolescents (AOR, 1.61; CI, 1.06-2.45; P<0.01). A higher proportion of lowland Thai respondents reported having >= 2 lifetime sexual partners (51.9% vs. 33.3%, P= 0.003), or currently having a boy/girlfriend (59.9% vs. 45.3%, P< 0.001) compared to ethnic minority adolescents. Consistent condom use was low in both groups (22.6%). The common significant factors associated with \"ever had sex\" in both groups were \"ever drunk alcohol in the past year\" and \"currently having a boy/girlfriend.\" Specifically, for lowland Thai youth, being around the age of 17 or 18 years and \"ever used methamphetamine in the past year\" were associated with increased odds of \"ever had sex\". For ethnic minority adolescents, being female and belonging to religions other than Buddhism were associated with decreased odds of \"ever had sex\". Conclusion A substantially higher proportion of lowland Thai engage in risky sexual behaviors when compared to ethnic minorities. However, both groups remained vulnerable to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. To minimize sexual risks, education program and school-based interventions are warranted to increase awareness of young people about risky behaviors and to promote essential life skills.","Author":"","Title":"Patterns of Sexual Behavior in Lowland Thai Youth and Ethnic Minorities Attending High School in Rural Chiang Mai, Thailand","ReviewID":"16","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Beside the aspect-oriented of religious belief, the translations and interpretations of Buddhist Classics may be considered as the main route in the spreading of Buddhism in China. In the history of the development of Chinese Buddhist Philosophy, several Buddhist scholars of the mainstream schools based on Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa as a reference in their theoretical construction undesignedly, and their interpretative standpoints generated an important influence in later generations. Since Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa is one of the sources in the interpretation and development of Chinese Buddhist Philosophy, and if we can take a closer inspection into the interpretative standpoints of those influential scholars, a different approach to the reflection and discussion might be offered to the argumentation of Chinese Buddhist Philosophy from the widely accepted course of Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa in China. The scopes of studies expanded how Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa influenced the interpretations of Chinese Buddhist Philosophy are quite extensive, so this paper only focuses on Ji-zang (549-623 C.E.) as the main case. Aiming on Ji-zang's concrete interpretations of Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa as a foundation, this paper attempts to introspect and sort out the interpretative activities of the interpreter from his perspectives, and in addition to that, figures out the religious dimensions hidden behind the interpretative 1 activities of Ji-zang. The conclusion of this paper pointed out that the influences of Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa on the interpretations of Ji-zang can be classified into two aspects which is the theoretical and the practical respectively. On the theoretical aspect, Ji-zang usually cited some of the viewpoints of Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa and interpreted on it, at the same time, used it to criticize the assertions of the schools which holds incompatible argumentation. On the practical aspect, Ji-zang particularly highlighted the significance of \"no gain (wusuode)\", which not only manifested the peculiarly Buddhist religious practice of self deconstruction, Ji-zang also applied it in his interpretations and discriminations of Buddhist philosophical theory.

While these perspectives are pertinent, in this paper we employ a political economic framework to investigate how retainer sacrifice was practiced over two centuries in the ancient kingdom of Silla in Korea and why it was ultimately banned. We suggest that retainer sacrifice rites can be regarded as public goods supplied by elite hosts and consumed by the public at large. On a regional scale, the supply of retainer sacrifice was maintained by an oligopolistic or cartel like market structure, which shaped sociopolitical relations among Silla royalty, elites, and communities. Rising costs of retainer sacrifice and an opportunistic strategy of the central government to monopolize the religious market brought about the illegalization of retainer sacrifice followed by the adoption of Buddhism as a state religion.

Many studies have shown a central role for transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF beta-1) and its downstream signaling cascades in the pathogenesis of CKD. In this study, we have reanalyzed a microarray dataset to recognize critical signaling pathways controlled by TGF beta-1. Materials and Methods: This study is a bioinformatics reanalysis for a microarray data. The GSE23338 dataset was downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database which assesses the mRNA expression profile of TGF beta-1 treated human kidney cells after 24 and 48 hours incubation. The protein interaction networks for differentially expressed (DE) genes in both time points were constructed and enriched. In addition, by network topology analysis, genes with high centrality were identified and then pathway enrichment analysis was performed with either the total network genes or with the central nodes. Results: We found 110 and 170 genes differentially expressed in the time points 24 and 48 hours, respectively. As the genes in each time point had few interactions, the networks were enriched by adding previously known genes interacting with the differentially expressed ones. In terms of degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality parameters 62 and 60 nodes were considered to be central in the enriched networks of 24 hours and 48 hours treatment, respectively. Pathway enrichment analysis with the central nodes was more informative than those with all network nodes or even initial DE genes, revealing key signaling pathways. Conclusion: We introduced a method for the analysis of microarray data that integrates the expression pattern of genes with their topological properties in protein interaction networks.

When designing a drug-eluting stent system, we expect to have a sufficient amount of drug being released into the artery wall for a sufficient period to prevent restenosis. In this paper, a simple model is considered to provide an elementary description of drug release into artery tissue from an implanted stent. From the model, we identified a parameter regime to optimise the system when preparing the polymer coating. The model provides some useful order of magnitude estimates for the key quantities of interest. From the model, we can identify the time scales over which the drug traverses the artery wall and empties from the polymer coating, as well as obtain approximate formulae for the total amount of drug in the artery tissue and the fraction of drug that has released from the polymer.

A deeper understanding of microbial responses to stress is indeed attainable only considering the phenomenon as a whole. Exhaustive knowledge of the various stress response systems, and of their interconnections, is important for different applications, from the prevention and counteraction of bacterial infectious diseases to the engineering of robust cell factories. The presentations covered all of these aspects, enabling an active interaction among participants. It also stimulated discussions and cross-fertilisation among disciplines, which was one of the aims of the meeting.

The meeting presented numerous methods for the development of novel synthetic strains, synthetic biological tools and synthetic biology applications. With the aid of synthetic biology, production costs of chemicals, metabolites and food products are expected to decrease, by generating sustainable biochemical production of such resources. Also, such synthetic biological advances could be applied for medical purposes, as in pharmaceuticals and for biosensors. Recurrent, linked themes throughout the meeting were the shortage of resources, the world's transition into a bioeconomy, and how synthetic biology is helping tackle these issues through cutting-edge technologies. While there are still limitations in synthetic biology research, innovation is propelling the development of technology, the standardisation of synthetic biological tools and the use of suitable host organisms.

Materials and Methods: This experimental study evaluated the viability and morphology of MSCs in the presence of SNP (100 to 2000 mu M) at 1, 5, and 15 hours. We chose the 100, 1000, and 2000 mu M concentrations of SNP for one hour exposure for further analyses. Cell proliferation was investigated by the colony forming assay and population doubling number (PDN). Na+, K+, and Ca2+ levels as well as activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) were measured. Results: The viability of MSCs dose-dependently reduced from 750 mu M at one hour and 250 mu M at 5 and 15 hours. The 100 mu M caused no change in viability, however we observed a reduction in the cytoplasmic area at 5 and 15 hours. This change was not observed at one hour. The one hour treatment with 100 mu M of SNP reduced the mean colony numbers but not the diameter when the cells were incubated for 7 and 14 days. In addition, one hour treatment with 100 mu M of SNP significantly reduced ALT, AST, and ALP activities whereas the activity of LDH increased when incubated for 24 hours. The same treatment caused an increase in Ca2+ and reduction in Na+ content. The 1000 and 2000 mu M concentrations reduced all the factors except Ca2+ and LDH which increased. Conclusion: The high dose of SNP, even for a short time, was toxic. The low dose was safe with respect to viability and proliferation, especially over a short time. However elevated LDH activity might increase anaerobic metabolism.","Author":"","Title":"Sodium Nitroprusside Changed The Metabolism of Mesenchymal Stem Cells to An Anaerobic State while Viability and Proliferation Remained Intact","ReviewID":"6","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"2.0","Content":"Water, which is the habitat for a variety of living creatures, has a maximum density at 4.0 degrees C. This crucial property is considered to play a very important role in the biology of a lake and also has a close relationship with the areas of environmentology and geoscience. It would be desirable for students to confirm this important property of water themselves by carrying out simple experiments. However, it is not easy to detect the maximum density at 4.0 degrees C because the temperature dependence of the water density is very small close to its freezing point. For example, the density of water is 0.999 975 g cm(-3) at 4.0 degrees C and 0.999 850 g cm(-3) at 0.1 degrees C. The aim in this manuscript is to demonstrate a simple experiment to detect 4.0 degrees C as the temperature of maximum density, in which the time dependence of the water temperature is measured at several different depths by chilling the water surface. This is a simple experiment that can also be performed by high school students.

The formulation involves systems of highly nonlinear partial differential equations of surface effects through diffuse-interface models [27]. Simulations of this practical model using numerical methods can be applied for evaluating it. The present paper investigates the solution of the tumor growth model with meshless techniques. Meshless methods are applied based on the collocation technique which employ multiquadrics (MQ) radial basis function (RBFs) and generalized moving least squares (GMLS) procedures. The main advantages of these choices come back to the natural behavior of meshless approaches. As well as, a method based on meshless approach can be applied easily for finding the solution of partial differential equations in high-dimension using any distributions of points on regular and irregular domains. The present paper involves a time-dependent system of partial differential equations that describes four-species tumor growth model. To overcome the time variable, two procedures will be used. One of them is a semi-implicit finite difference method based on Crank-Nicolson scheme and another one is based on explicit Runge-Kutta time integration. The first case gives a linear system of algebraic equations which will be solved at each time-step. The second case will be efficient but conditionally stable. The obtained numerical results are reported to confirm the ability of these techniques for solving the two and three-dimensional tumor-growth equations.

These exosomes can mediate communication between cells and affect various tumor-related processes in their target cells. We present a quantitative proteomics analysis of the exosomes purified from serum of patients with CRC and normal volunteers; data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD003875. We identified 918 proteins with an overlap of 725 Gene IDs in the Exocarta proteins list. Compared with the serum-purified exosomes (SPEs) of normal volunteers, we found 36 proteins upregulated and 22 proteins downregulated in the SPEs of CRC patients. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that upregulated proteins are involved in processes that modulate the pretumorigenic microenvironment for metastasis. In contrast, differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) that play critical roles in tumor growth and cell survival were principally downregulated. Our study demonstrates that SPEs of CRC patients play a pivotal role in promoting the tumor invasiveness, but have minimal influence on putative alterations in tumor survival or proliferation. According to bioinformatics analysis, we speculate that the protein contents of exosomes might be associated with whether they are involved in premetastatic niche establishment or growth and survival of metastatic tumor cells. This information will be helpful in elucidating the pathophysiological functions of tumor-derived exosomes, and aid in the development of CRC diagnostics and therapeutics.","Author":"","Title":"Protein content and functional characteristics of serum-purified exosomes from patients with colorectal cancer revealed by quantitative proteomics","ReviewID":"16","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"2.0","Content":"Explaining the evolution of cooperative behavior is one of the most important and interesting problems in a myriad of disciplines, such as evolutionary biology, mathematics, statistical physics, social science and economics Up to now, there have been a great number of works aiming to this issue with the help of evolutionary game theory.

Studying these traits can provide important insights into how evolutionary forces drive convergent and regressive adaptation.

A wealth of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping studies in sticklebacks have provided insight into longstanding questions about the distribution of effect sizes during adaptation as well as the role of genetic linkage in facilitating adaptation. These QTL mapping studies have also provided a basis for the identification of the genes that underlie phenotypic diversity. These data have revealed that mutations in regulatory elements play an important role in the evolution of phenotypic diversity in sticklebacks. Genetic and molecular studies in sticklebacks have also led to new insights on the genetic basis of repeated evolution and suggest that the same loci are involved about half of the time when the same phenotypes evolve independently. When the same locus is involved, selection on standing variation and repeated mutation of the same genes have both contributed to the evolution of similar phenotypes in independent populations.

Sir Richard Owen also took great care to highlight each of the elements of the forelimb and hindlimb in a multitude of species with focused attention on the homology between the hoof of the horse and the middle digit of man. The ensuing decades brought about a convergence of palaeontology, experimental embryology and molecular biology to lend further support to the homologies of tetrapod limbs and their developmental origins. However, for all that we now understand about the conserved mechanisms of limb development and the development of gross morphological disturbances, little of what is presented in the experimental or medical literature reflects the remarkable diversity resulting from the 450 million year experiment of natural selection. An understanding of conserved and divergent limb morphologies in this new age of genomics and genome engineering promises to reveal more of the developmental potential residing in all limbs and to unravel the mechanisms of evolutionary variation in limb size and shape.

Development is central because it is the means by which genetic information of an organism is translated into morphology.

Recent approaches include imaging, quantitative morphometrics and, in particular, genomics, which brings a new dimension. Articles in this issue illustrate the contemporary evo-devo field by considering general principles emerging from genomics and how this and other approaches are applied to specific questions about the evolution of major transitions and innovations in morphology, diversification and modification of structures, intraspecific morphological variation and developmental plasticity.

The distinctions between homologous or non-homologous structures have become blurred, however, as modern evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) has shown that novel features often result from modification of pre-existing developmental modules, rather than arising completely de novo. With this realization in mind, the term 'deep homology' was coined, in recognition of the remarkably conserved gene expression during the development of certain animal structures that would not be considered homologous by previous strict definitions. At its core, it can help to formulate an understanding of deeper layers of ontogenetic conservation for anatomical features that lack any clear phylogenetic continuity. Here, we review deep homology and related concepts in the context of a gene expression-based homology discussion. We then focus on how these conceptual frameworks have profited from the recent rise of high-throughput next-generation sequencing. These techniques have greatly expanded the range of organisms amenable to such studies. Moreover, they helped to elevate the traditional gene-by-gene comparison to a transcriptome-wide level.

However, research on their biology, ecology and behaviour to develop management tactics is hampered by the lack of reliable attacks on experimental trees. Injecting Magnolia virginiana L. with ethanol consistently induced attacks by exotic ambrosia beetles to facilitate research on their biology and management. The ability to attract ambrosia beetles to trap trees may be useful for developing nonchemical strategies and techniques for managing them in nurseries. However, to be useful in management techniques, ethanol-injection has to reliably induce attacks on a vlariety of tree species. Experiments were conducted in Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia, where ethanol-injection was tested on 16 species of deciduous trees from 11 families. Ethanol-injection reliably induced attacks by exotic ambrosia beetles on all tree species tested. There were differences in the numbers of attacks by ambrosia beetles among species of trees in most experiments, although no species was identified consistently as the most or least attacked in repeated experiments. The positive association of attacks with ethanol concentrations in bark tissue indicate that the attack rates were most likely related to the uptake and emission of ethanol. The results of the present study indicate that ethanol-injection reliably induces ambrosia beetle attacks on a wide range of deciduous tree species, which should further facilitate research on ambrosia beetles in nurseries and the development of behaviour-based management tactics that divert ambrosia beetles away from ornamental trees.","Author":"","Title":"Ethanol-injection induces attacks by ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) on a variety of tree species","ReviewID":"26","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"2.0","Content":"Manipulation of the reproductive activity of jackals is dependent on a thorough understanding of the reproductive biology of this species.

The author created conditions in which he would experience boredom for an hour and recorded his experience in real-time using a variant of the Experiencing Sampling Method. The data were analysed using an adaptation of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The results indicated that the state of boredom contained three main sources of value: altered perception of time, awakened curiosity about the environment, and exploration of self.

Among these, dramatic preaching of the dharma was performed to communicate to ordinary people in a more lively and interesting manner than the teaching of the sutras.

The potential shifts inwomen's capacities to create spaces between pregnancies or to prevent future pregnancies have profound and often positive biological, demographic, and socioeconomic implications. Less acknowledged, however, are the ambivalences that women experience around contraception use-vacillations between moral frameworks, generational difference, and gendered forms of labor that have implications well beyond the boundaries of an individual's reproductive biology. This paper hones in on contraceptive use of culturally Tibetan women in two regions of highland Nepal whose reproductive lives occurred from 1943 to 2012. Methods We describe the experiences of the 296 women ( out of a study of more than 1000 women's reproductive histories) who used contraception, and under what circumstances, examining socioeconomic, geographic, and age differences as well as points of access and patterns of use. We also provide a longitudinal perspective on fertility. Results Our results relate contraception usage to fertility decline, as well as to differences in access between the two communities of women. Conclusions Weargue that despite seemingly similar social ecologies of these two study sites-including stated reasons for the adoption of contraception and expressed ambivalence around its use, someof which are linked to moral and cosmological understandings that emerge from Buddhism-the dynamics of contraception uptake in these two regions are distinct, as are, therefore, patterns of fertility transition.","Author":"","Title":"Closing the Womb Door: Contraception Use and Fertility Transition Among Culturally Tibetan Women in Highland Nepal","ReviewID":"10","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Consciousness and perception of reality are related to internal and external factors as the sum of collective and social interactions.

Methods: A general population-based survey was carried out in 2013 in the greater Hanoi area. The perception of stigma attached to people with mental illness was elicited using Link's perceived discrimination and devaluation scale (PDDS) carried out in Vietnamese language. The survey sample (n=806) was stratified for gender, urban/rural location, age, household size and marital status, in accordance with the 2013 Vietnamese census. Results: Comparing the total score of the PDDS and its single items, we found less perceived stigma and discrimination among the rural population of Hanoi and in respondents who reported religious attainment to either Buddhism or Christianity. Logistic regression analyses found no significant influences of gender, age, household size or marital status regarding the perceived stigma toward persons with mental illness.

Previous studies have shown that young people in rural Thailand have low levels of knowledge on HIV/AIDS and high sexual risks. We compared sexual behaviors between the lowland Thai youth and the youth from ethnic minority groups. Methods and findings This is a cross-sectional quantitative study conducted among high-school Thai and ethnic students in Chiang Mai. From a total 1215 participants, 487 (40.1%) were lowland Thai and 728 (59.9%) were from ethnic minorities. Overall, 17.9% of respondents reported \"ever had sex.\" Lowland Thai adolescents were more likely to have ever had sex compared with ethnic minority adolescents (AOR, 1.61; CI, 1.06-2.45; P<0.01). A higher proportion of lowland Thai respondents reported having >= 2 lifetime sexual partners (51.9% vs. 33.3%, P= 0.003), or currently having a boy/girlfriend (59.9% vs. 45.3%, P< 0.001) compared to ethnic minority adolescents. Consistent condom use was low in both groups (22.6%). The common significant factors associated with \"ever had sex\" in both groups were \"ever drunk alcohol in the past year\" and \"currently having a boy/girlfriend.\" Specifically, for lowland Thai youth, being around the age of 17 or 18 years and \"ever used methamphetamine in the past year\" were associated with increased odds of \"ever had sex\". For ethnic minority adolescents, being female and belonging to religions other than Buddhism were associated with decreased odds of \"ever had sex\". Conclusion A substantially higher proportion of lowland Thai engage in risky sexual behaviors when compared to ethnic minorities. However, both groups remained vulnerable to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. To minimize sexual risks, education program and school-based interventions are warranted to increase awareness of young people about risky behaviors and to promote essential life skills.","Author":"","Title":"Patterns of Sexual Behavior in Lowland Thai Youth and Ethnic Minorities Attending High School in Rural Chiang Mai, Thailand","ReviewID":"16","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Beside the aspect-oriented of religious belief, the translations and interpretations of Buddhist Classics may be considered as the main route in the spreading of Buddhism in China. In the history of the development of Chinese Buddhist Philosophy, several Buddhist scholars of the mainstream schools based on Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa as a reference in their theoretical construction undesignedly, and their interpretative standpoints generated an important influence in later generations. Since Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa is one of the sources in the interpretation and development of Chinese Buddhist Philosophy, and if we can take a closer inspection into the interpretative standpoints of those influential scholars, a different approach to the reflection and discussion might be offered to the argumentation of Chinese Buddhist Philosophy from the widely accepted course of Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa in China. The scopes of studies expanded how Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa influenced the interpretations of Chinese Buddhist Philosophy are quite extensive, so this paper only focuses on Ji-zang (549-623 C.E.) as the main case. Aiming on Ji-zang's concrete interpretations of Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa as a foundation, this paper attempts to introspect and sort out the interpretative activities of the interpreter from his perspectives, and in addition to that, figures out the religious dimensions hidden behind the interpretative 1 activities of Ji-zang. The conclusion of this paper pointed out that the influences of Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa on the interpretations of Ji-zang can be classified into two aspects which is the theoretical and the practical respectively. On the theoretical aspect, Ji-zang usually cited some of the viewpoints of Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa and interpreted on it, at the same time, used it to criticize the assertions of the schools which holds incompatible argumentation. On the practical aspect, Ji-zang particularly highlighted the significance of \"no gain (wusuode)\", which not only manifested the peculiarly Buddhist religious practice of self deconstruction, Ji-zang also applied it in his interpretations and discriminations of Buddhist philosophical theory.

While these perspectives are pertinent, in this paper we employ a political economic framework to investigate how retainer sacrifice was practiced over two centuries in the ancient kingdom of Silla in Korea and why it was ultimately banned. We suggest that retainer sacrifice rites can be regarded as public goods supplied by elite hosts and consumed by the public at large. On a regional scale, the supply of retainer sacrifice was maintained by an oligopolistic or cartel like market structure, which shaped sociopolitical relations among Silla royalty, elites, and communities. Rising costs of retainer sacrifice and an opportunistic strategy of the central government to monopolize the religious market brought about the illegalization of retainer sacrifice followed by the adoption of Buddhism as a state religion.

A monk's cultural position within Burmese Buddhism particularly strengthens his authority when he frames his preaching and actions as a defense of Buddhism.

Many studies have shown a central role for transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF beta-1) and its downstream signaling cascades in the pathogenesis of CKD. In this study, we have reanalyzed a microarray dataset to recognize critical signaling pathways controlled by TGF beta-1. Materials and Methods: This study is a bioinformatics reanalysis for a microarray data. The GSE23338 dataset was downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database which assesses the mRNA expression profile of TGF beta-1 treated human kidney cells after 24 and 48 hours incubation. The protein interaction networks for differentially expressed (DE) genes in both time points were constructed and enriched. In addition, by network topology analysis, genes with high centrality were identified and then pathway enrichment analysis was performed with either the total network genes or with the central nodes. Results: We found 110 and 170 genes differentially expressed in the time points 24 and 48 hours, respectively. As the genes in each time point had few interactions, the networks were enriched by adding previously known genes interacting with the differentially expressed ones. In terms of degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality parameters 62 and 60 nodes were considered to be central in the enriched networks of 24 hours and 48 hours treatment, respectively. Pathway enrichment analysis with the central nodes was more informative than those with all network nodes or even initial DE genes, revealing key signaling pathways. Conclusion: We introduced a method for the analysis of microarray data that integrates the expression pattern of genes with their topological properties in protein interaction networks. This holistic novel approach allows extracting knowledge from raw bulk omics data.","Author":"","Title":"Central Nodes in Protein Interaction Networks Drive Critical Functions in Transforming Growth Factor Beta-1 Stimulated Kidney Cells","ReviewID":"0","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"2.0","Content":"Drug-eluting stents have been used widely to prevent restenosis of arteries following percutaneous balloon angioplasty. Mathematical modelling plays an important role in optimising the design of these stents to maximise their efficiency. When designing a drug-eluting stent system, we expect to have a sufficient amount of drug being released into the artery wall for a sufficient period to prevent restenosis. In this paper, a simple model is considered to provide an elementary description of drug release into artery tissue from an implanted stent. From the model, we identified a parameter regime to optimise the system when preparing the polymer coating. The model provides some useful order of magnitude estimates for the key quantities of interest. From the model, we can identify the time scales over which the drug traverses the artery wall and empties from the polymer coating, as well as obtain approximate formulae for the total amount of drug in the artery tissue and the fraction of drug that has released from the polymer.

We chose the 100, 1000, and 2000 mu M concentrations of SNP for one hour exposure for further analyses. Cell proliferation was investigated by the colony forming assay and population doubling number (PDN). Na+, K+, and Ca2+ levels as well as activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) were measured. Results: The viability of MSCs dose-dependently reduced from 750 mu M at one hour and 250 mu M at 5 and 15 hours. The 100 mu M caused no change in viability, however we observed a reduction in the cytoplasmic area at 5 and 15 hours. This change was not observed at one hour. The one hour treatment with 100 mu M of SNP reduced the mean colony numbers but not the diameter when the cells were incubated for 7 and 14 days. In addition, one hour treatment with 100 mu M of SNP significantly reduced ALT, AST, and ALP activities whereas the activity of LDH increased when incubated for 24 hours. The same treatment caused an increase in Ca2+ and reduction in Na+ content. The 1000 and 2000 mu M concentrations reduced all the factors except Ca2+ and LDH which increased.

This crucial property is considered to play a very important role in the biology of a lake and also has a close relationship with the areas of environmentology and geoscience. It would be desirable for students to confirm this important property of water themselves by carrying out simple experiments. However, it is not easy to detect the maximum density at 4.0 degrees C because the temperature dependence of the water density is very small close to its freezing point.

The formulation involves systems of highly nonlinear partial differential equations of surface effects through diffuse-interface models [27]. Simulations of this practical model using numerical methods can be applied for evaluating it. The present paper investigates the solution of the tumor growth model with meshless techniques. Meshless methods are applied based on the collocation technique which employ multiquadrics (MQ) radial basis function (RBFs) and generalized moving least squares (GMLS) procedures. The main advantages of these choices come back to the natural behavior of meshless approaches. As well as, a method based on meshless approach can be applied easily for finding the solution of partial differential equations in high-dimension using any distributions of points on regular and irregular domains. The present paper involves a time-dependent system of partial differential equations that describes four-species tumor growth model. To overcome the time variable, two procedures will be used. One of them is a semi-implicit finite difference method based on Crank-Nicolson scheme and another one is based on explicit Runge-Kutta time integration. The first case gives a linear system of algebraic equations which will be solved at each time-step. The second case will be efficient but conditionally stable. The obtained numerical results are reported to confirm the ability of these techniques for solving the two and three-dimensional tumor-growth equations.

These exosomes can mediate communication between cells and affect various tumor-related processes in their target cells. We present a quantitative proteomics analysis of the exosomes purified from serum of patients with CRC and normal volunteers; data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD003875. We identified 918 proteins with an overlap of 725 Gene IDs in the Exocarta proteins list. Compared with the serum-purified exosomes (SPEs) of normal volunteers, we found 36 proteins upregulated and 22 proteins downregulated in the SPEs of CRC patients. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that upregulated proteins are involved in processes that modulate the pretumorigenic microenvironment for metastasis. In contrast, differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) that play critical roles in tumor growth and cell survival were principally downregulated. Our study demonstrates that SPEs of CRC patients play a pivotal role in promoting the tumor invasiveness, but have minimal influence on putative alterations in tumor survival or proliferation. According to bioinformatics analysis, we speculate that the protein contents of exosomes might be associated with whether they are involved in premetastatic niche establishment or growth and survival of metastatic tumor cells. This information will be helpful in elucidating the pathophysiological functions of tumor-derived exosomes, and aid in the development of CRC diagnostics and therapeutics.","Author":"","Title":"Protein content and functional characteristics of serum-purified exosomes from patients with colorectal cancer revealed by quantitative proteomics","ReviewID":"16","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"2.0","Content":"Explaining the evolution of cooperative behavior is one of the most important and interesting problems in a myriad of disciplines, such as evolutionary biology, mathematics, statistical physics, social science and economics Up to now, there have been a great number of works aiming to this issue with the help of evolutionary game theory.

However, the colloidal electrostatic interaction is rapid and uncontrolled, the strong interaction usually leads to large and irregular aggregates. Therefore, control of the electrostatic interaction in order to resulting well-defined nanostructures remains a challenge. Here we report on a general and simple method to moderate the wild electrostatic interaction. Direct mixing of stock solutions containing anionic superparamagnetic nanoparticles and widespread cationic homopolyelectrolytes at an appropriate ionic strength generates aggregates with controlled shape and morphology. The simple and versatile methodology not only efficiently moderates electrostatic interactions but also enables the corresponding growth mechanism to be revealed by light scattering and electron microscopy as aggregation occurs at much slower timescales.

Cave environments present such a challenge and obligate cave animals have adapted to perpetual darkness by evolving a multitude of traits. The most common and most studied cave characteristics are the regression of eyes and the overall reduction in pigmentation. Studying these traits can provide important insights into how evolutionary forces drive convergent and regressive adaptation. The blind Mexican cavefish (Astyanax mexicanus) has emerged as a useful model to study cave evolution owing to the availability of genetic and genomic resources, and the amenability of embryonic development as the different populations remain fertile with each other.

Stickleback fish, including the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), have been at the forefront of research to uncover the genetic and molecular architecture that underlies phenotypic diversity and adaptation. A wealth of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping studies in sticklebacks have provided insight into longstanding questions about the distribution of effect sizes during adaptation as well as the role of genetic linkage in facilitating adaptation. These QTL mapping studies have also provided a basis for the identification of the genes that underlie phenotypic diversity. These data have revealed that mutations in regulatory elements play an important role in the evolution of phenotypic diversity in sticklebacks. Genetic and molecular studies in sticklebacks have also led to new insights on the genetic basis of repeated evolution and suggest that the same loci are involved about half of the time when the same phenotypes evolve independently. When the same locus is involved, selection on standing variation and repeated mutation of the same genes have both contributed to the evolution of similar phenotypes in independent populations.

Sir Richard Owen also took great care to highlight each of the elements of the forelimb and hindlimb in a multitude of species with focused attention on the homology between the hoof of the horse and the middle digit of man. The ensuing decades brought about a convergence of palaeontology, experimental embryology and molecular biology to lend further support to the homologies of tetrapod limbs and their developmental origins. However, for all that we now understand about the conserved mechanisms of limb development and the development of gross morphological disturbances, little of what is presented in the experimental or medical literature reflects the remarkable diversity resulting from the 450 million year experiment of natural selection. An understanding of conserved and divergent limb morphologies in this new age of genomics and genome engineering promises to reveal more of the developmental potential residing in all limbs and to unravel the mechanisms of evolutionary variation in limb size and shape.

In this theme issue, we celebrate how evolutionary studies on the origins of morphological diversity have changed over the past 350 years since the first publication of the Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society. Current understanding of this topic is enriched by many disciplines, including anatomy, palaeontology, developmental biology, genetics and genomics. Development is central because it is the means by which genetic information of an organism is translated into morphology. The discovery of the genetic basis of development has revealed how changes in form can be inherited, leading to the emergence of the field known as evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo). Recent approaches include imaging, quantitative morphometrics and, in particular, genomics, which brings a new dimension. Articles in this issue illustrate the contemporary evo-devo field by considering general principles emerging from genomics and how this and other approaches are applied to specific questions about the evolution of major transitions and innovations in morphology, diversification and modification of structures, intraspecific morphological variation and developmental plasticity. Current approaches enable a much broader range of organisms to be studied, thus building a better appreciation of the origins of morphological diversity.

The distinctions between homologous or non-homologous structures have become blurred, however, as modern evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) has shown that novel features often result from modification of pre-existing developmental modules, rather than arising completely de novo. With this realization in mind, the term 'deep homology' was coined, in recognition of the remarkably conserved gene expression during the development of certain animal structures that would not be considered homologous by previous strict definitions. At its core, it can help to formulate an understanding of deeper layers of ontogenetic conservation for anatomical features that lack any clear phylogenetic continuity. Here, we review deep homology and related concepts in the context of a gene expression-based homology discussion. We then focus on how these conceptual frameworks have profited from the recent rise of high-throughput next-generation sequencing. These techniques have greatly expanded the range of organisms amenable to such studies. Moreover, they helped to elevate the traditional gene-by-gene comparison to a transcriptome-wide level.

However, research on their biology, ecology and behaviour to develop management tactics is hampered by the lack of reliable attacks on experimental trees. Injecting Magnolia virginiana L. with ethanol consistently induced attacks by exotic ambrosia beetles to facilitate research on their biology and management. The ability to attract ambrosia beetles to trap trees may be useful for developing nonchemical strategies and techniques for managing them in nurseries. However, to be useful in management techniques, ethanol-injection has to reliably induce attacks on a vlariety of tree species. Experiments were conducted in Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia, where ethanol-injection was tested on 16 species of deciduous trees from 11 families. Ethanol-injection reliably induced attacks by exotic ambrosia beetles on all tree species tested. There were differences in the numbers of attacks by ambrosia beetles among species of trees in most experiments, although no species was identified consistently as the most or least attacked in repeated experiments. The positive association of attacks with ethanol concentrations in bark tissue indicate that the attack rates were most likely related to the uptake and emission of ethanol. The results of the present study indicate that ethanol-injection reliably induces ambrosia beetle attacks on a wide range of deciduous tree species, which should further facilitate research on ambrosia beetles in nurseries and the development of behaviour-based management tactics that divert ambrosia beetles away from ornamental trees.","Author":"","Title":"Ethanol-injection induces attacks by ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) on a variety of tree species","ReviewID":"26","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"2.0","Content":"Manipulation of the reproductive activity of jackals is dependent on a thorough understanding of the reproductive biology of this species.

We also provide a longitudinal perspective on fertility. Results Our results relate contraception usage to fertility decline, as well as to differences in access between the two communities of women. Conclusions Weargue that despite seemingly similar social ecologies of these two study sites-including stated reasons for the adoption of contraception and expressed ambivalence around its use, someof which are linked to moral and cosmological understandings that emerge from Buddhism-the dynamics of contraception uptake in these two regions are distinct, as are, therefore, patterns of fertility transition.","Author":"","Title":"Closing the Womb Door: Contraception Use and Fertility Transition Among Culturally Tibetan Women in Highland Nepal","ReviewID":"10","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Consciousness and perception of reality are related to internal and external factors as the sum of collective and social interactions. Attila Grandpierre in his 'The physics of collective consciousness' underlined the prime role of performing arts quoting the words of Vekerdy, who said that theatrical artists especially in the ancient Japanese Noh Theatre have a great effect on audience in three ways: using words, hearing by movements, through seeing and the use of intense emotion. Generally in the design field the relation between user and the product is stressed; on the other hand, in the theatre field the ability to explore and underlining the social impact of a specific object or action is important.

Methods: A general population-based survey was carried out in 2013 in the greater Hanoi area. The perception of stigma attached to people with mental illness was elicited using Link's perceived discrimination and devaluation scale (PDDS) carried out in Vietnamese language. The survey sample (n=806) was stratified for gender, urban/rural location, age, household size and marital status, in accordance with the 2013 Vietnamese census. Results: Comparing the total score of the PDDS and its single items, we found less perceived stigma and discrimination among the rural population of Hanoi and in respondents who reported religious attainment to either Buddhism or Christianity. Logistic regression analyses found no significant influences of gender, age, household size or marital status regarding the perceived stigma toward persons with mental illness. Conclusion: Less negative perception of stigma attached to persons with mental illness that was observed among the rural population in the Hanoi area may be interpreted in the light of possibly more demanding living conditions in modern urban Vietnam with less opportunities for mentally ill patients and points toward a dynamic interaction with rapidly changing living conditions in Asian megacities.","Author":"","Title":"Influence of urbanity on perception of mental illness stigma: a population based study in urban and rural Hanoi, Vietnam","ReviewID":"15","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Introduction The rural areas of Northern Thailand are home to a large cultural diversity of ethnic minority groups. Previous studies have shown that young people in rural Thailand have low levels of knowledge on HIV/AIDS and high sexual risks. We compared sexual behaviors between the lowland Thai youth and the youth from ethnic minority groups. Methods and findings This is a cross-sectional quantitative study conducted among high-school Thai and ethnic students in Chiang Mai. From a total 1215 participants, 487 (40.1%) were lowland Thai and 728 (59.9%) were from ethnic minorities. Overall, 17.9% of respondents reported \"ever had sex.\" Lowland Thai adolescents were more likely to have ever had sex compared with ethnic minority adolescents (AOR, 1.61; CI, 1.06-2.45; P<0.01). A higher proportion of lowland Thai respondents reported having >= 2 lifetime sexual partners (51.9% vs. 33.3%, P= 0.003), or currently having a boy/girlfriend (59.9% vs. 45.3%, P< 0.001) compared to ethnic minority adolescents. Consistent condom use was low in both groups (22.6%). The common significant factors associated with \"ever had sex\" in both groups were \"ever drunk alcohol in the past year\" and \"currently having a boy/girlfriend.\" Specifically, for lowland Thai youth, being around the age of 17 or 18 years and \"ever used methamphetamine in the past year\" were associated with increased odds of \"ever had sex\". For ethnic minority adolescents, being female and belonging to religions other than Buddhism were associated with decreased odds of \"ever had sex\". Conclusion A substantially higher proportion of lowland Thai engage in risky sexual behaviors when compared to ethnic minorities. However, both groups remained vulnerable to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. To minimize sexual risks, education program and school-based interventions are warranted to increase awareness of young people about risky behaviors and to promote essential life skills.","Author":"","Title":"Patterns of Sexual Behavior in Lowland Thai Youth and Ethnic Minorities Attending High School in Rural Chiang Mai, Thailand","ReviewID":"16","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Beside the aspect-oriented of religious belief, the translations and interpretations of Buddhist Classics may be considered as the main route in the spreading of Buddhism in China. In the history of the development of Chinese Buddhist Philosophy, several Buddhist scholars of the mainstream schools based on Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa as a reference in their theoretical construction undesignedly, and their interpretative standpoints generated an important influence in later generations. Since Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa is one of the sources in the interpretation and development of Chinese Buddhist Philosophy, and if we can take a closer inspection into the interpretative standpoints of those influential scholars, a different approach to the reflection and discussion might be offered to the argumentation of Chinese Buddhist Philosophy from the widely accepted course of Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa in China. The scopes of studies expanded how Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa influenced the interpretations of Chinese Buddhist Philosophy are quite extensive, so this paper only focuses on Ji-zang (549-623 C.E.) as the main case. Aiming on Ji-zang's concrete interpretations of Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa as a foundation, this paper attempts to introspect and sort out the interpretative activities of the interpreter from his perspectives, and in addition to that, figures out the religious dimensions hidden behind the interpretative 1 activities of Ji-zang. The conclusion of this paper pointed out that the influences of Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa on the interpretations of Ji-zang can be classified into two aspects which is the theoretical and the practical respectively. On the theoretical aspect, Ji-zang usually cited some of the viewpoints of Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa and interpreted on it, at the same time, used it to criticize the assertions of the schools which holds incompatible argumentation. On the practical aspect, Ji-zang particularly highlighted the significance of \"no gain (wusuode)\", which not only manifested the peculiarly Buddhist religious practice of self deconstruction, Ji-zang also applied it in his interpretations and discriminations of Buddhist philosophical theory. And these are regarded as a practice of interpretations that is accompanied by religious practice.","Author":"","Title":"How Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa Influenced the Interpretations of Chinese Buddhism? - A Case of Ji-zang","ReviewID":"17","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Motivations for human sacrifice are explained from various perspectives: the sociopolitical benefits gained by elite hosts and the ideological, cultural, or locally unique factors that motivate community members and victims of sacrifice to participate. While these perspectives are pertinent, in this paper we employ a political economic framework to investigate how retainer sacrifice was practiced over two centuries in the ancient kingdom of Silla in Korea and why it was ultimately banned. We suggest that retainer sacrifice rites can be regarded as public goods supplied by elite hosts and consumed by the public at large. On a regional scale, the supply of retainer sacrifice was maintained by an oligopolistic or cartel like market structure, which shaped sociopolitical relations among Silla royalty, elites, and communities. Rising costs of retainer sacrifice and an opportunistic strategy of the central government to monopolize the religious market brought about the illegalization of retainer sacrifice followed by the adoption of Buddhism as a state religion.

A monk's cultural position within Burmese Buddhism particularly strengthens his authority when he frames his preaching and actions as a defense of Buddhism.

Many studies have shown a central role for transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF beta-1) and its downstream signaling cascades in the pathogenesis of CKD. In this study, we have reanalyzed a microarray dataset to recognize critical signaling pathways controlled by TGF beta-1. Materials and Methods: This study is a bioinformatics reanalysis for a microarray data. The GSE23338 dataset was downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database which assesses the mRNA expression profile of TGF beta-1 treated human kidney cells after 24 and 48 hours incubation. The protein interaction networks for differentially expressed (DE) genes in both time points were constructed and enriched. In addition, by network topology analysis, genes with high centrality were identified and then pathway enrichment analysis was performed with either the total network genes or with the central nodes. Results: We found 110 and 170 genes differentially expressed in the time points 24 and 48 hours, respectively. As the genes in each time point had few interactions, the networks were enriched by adding previously known genes interacting with the differentially expressed ones. In terms of degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality parameters 62 and 60 nodes were considered to be central in the enriched networks of 24 hours and 48 hours treatment, respectively. Pathway enrichment analysis with the central nodes was more informative than those with all network nodes or even initial DE genes, revealing key signaling pathways. Conclusion: We introduced a method for the analysis of microarray data that integrates the expression pattern of genes with their topological properties in protein interaction networks. This holistic novel approach allows extracting knowledge from raw bulk omics data.","Author":"","Title":"Central Nodes in Protein Interaction Networks Drive Critical Functions in Transforming Growth Factor Beta-1 Stimulated Kidney Cells","ReviewID":"0","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"2.0","Content":"Drug-eluting stents have been used widely to prevent restenosis of arteries following percutaneous balloon angioplasty. Mathematical modelling plays an important role in optimising the design of these stents to maximise their efficiency. When designing a drug-eluting stent system, we expect to have a sufficient amount of drug being released into the artery wall for a sufficient period to prevent restenosis. In this paper, a simple model is considered to provide an elementary description of drug release into artery tissue from an implanted stent. From the model, we identified a parameter regime to optimise the system when preparing the polymer coating. The model provides some useful order of magnitude estimates for the key quantities of interest. From the model, we can identify the time scales over which the drug traverses the artery wall and empties from the polymer coating, as well as obtain approximate formulae for the total amount of drug in the artery tissue and the fraction of drug that has released from the polymer.

A deeper understanding of microbial responses to stress is indeed attainable only considering the phenomenon as a whole. Exhaustive knowledge of the various stress response systems, and of their interconnections, is important for different applications, from the prevention and counteraction of bacterial infectious diseases to the engineering of robust cell factories. The presentations covered all of these aspects, enabling an active interaction among participants. It also stimulated discussions and cross-fertilisation among disciplines, which was one of the aims of the meeting. Moreover, since many stress response mechanisms are broadly conserved, data obtained at the microbial scale may facilitate the comprehension of complex phenomena, such as aging, evolution of neurological diseases and cancer.

Materials and Methods: This experimental study evaluated the viability and morphology of MSCs in the presence of SNP (100 to 2000 mu M) at 1, 5, and 15 hours. We chose the 100, 1000, and 2000 mu M concentrations of SNP for one hour exposure for further analyses. Cell proliferation was investigated by the colony forming assay and population doubling number (PDN). Na+, K+, and Ca2+ levels as well as activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) were measured. Results: The viability of MSCs dose-dependently reduced from 750 mu M at one hour and 250 mu M at 5 and 15 hours. The 100 mu M caused no change in viability, however we observed a reduction in the cytoplasmic area at 5 and 15 hours. This change was not observed at one hour. The one hour treatment with 100 mu M of SNP reduced the mean colony numbers but not the diameter when the cells were incubated for 7 and 14 days. In addition, one hour treatment with 100 mu M of SNP significantly reduced ALT, AST, and ALP activities whereas the activity of LDH increased when incubated for 24 hours. The same treatment caused an increase in Ca2+ and reduction in Na+ content. The 1000 and 2000 mu M concentrations reduced all the factors except Ca2+ and LDH which increased. Conclusion: The high dose of SNP, even for a short time, was toxic. The low dose was safe with respect to viability and proliferation, especially over a short time.

This crucial property is considered to play a very important role in the biology of a lake and also has a close relationship with the areas of environmentology and geoscience. It would be desirable for students to confirm this important property of water themselves by carrying out simple experiments. However, it is not easy to detect the maximum density at 4.0 degrees C because the temperature dependence of the water density is very small close to its freezing point.

The formulation involves systems of highly nonlinear partial differential equations of surface effects through diffuse-interface models [27]. Simulations of this practical model using numerical methods can be applied for evaluating it. The present paper investigates the solution of the tumor growth model with meshless techniques. Meshless methods are applied based on the collocation technique which employ multiquadrics (MQ) radial basis function (RBFs) and generalized moving least squares (GMLS) procedures. The main advantages of these choices come back to the natural behavior of meshless approaches. As well as, a method based on meshless approach can be applied easily for finding the solution of partial differential equations in high-dimension using any distributions of points on regular and irregular domains. The present paper involves a time-dependent system of partial differential equations that describes four-species tumor growth model. To overcome the time variable, two procedures will be used. One of them is a semi-implicit finite difference method based on Crank-Nicolson scheme and another one is based on explicit Runge-Kutta time integration. The first case gives a linear system of algebraic equations which will be solved at each time-step. The second case will be efficient but conditionally stable.

We present a quantitative proteomics analysis of the exosomes purified from serum of patients with CRC and normal volunteers; data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD003875. We identified 918 proteins with an overlap of 725 Gene IDs in the Exocarta proteins list. Compared with the serum-purified exosomes (SPEs) of normal volunteers, we found 36 proteins upregulated and 22 proteins downregulated in the SPEs of CRC patients. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that upregulated proteins are involved in processes that modulate the pretumorigenic microenvironment for metastasis. In contrast, differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) that play critical roles in tumor growth and cell survival were principally downregulated. Our study demonstrates that SPEs of CRC patients play a pivotal role in promoting the tumor invasiveness, but have minimal influence on putative alterations in tumor survival or proliferation. According to bioinformatics analysis, we speculate that the protein contents of exosomes might be associated with whether they are involved in premetastatic niche establishment or growth and survival of metastatic tumor cells.

However, the colloidal electrostatic interaction is rapid and uncontrolled, the strong interaction usually leads to large and irregular aggregates. Therefore, control of the electrostatic interaction in order to resulting well-defined nanostructures remains a challenge. Here we report on a general and simple method to moderate the wild electrostatic interaction. Direct mixing of stock solutions containing anionic superparamagnetic nanoparticles and widespread cationic homopolyelectrolytes at an appropriate ionic strength generates aggregates with controlled shape and morphology. The simple and versatile methodology not only efficiently moderates electrostatic interactions but also enables the corresponding growth mechanism to be revealed by light scattering and electron microscopy as aggregation occurs at much slower timescales. The present results carry important implications for both practical applications and understanding on nanoscale electrostatic interaction between colloids. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Cave environments present such a challenge and obligate cave animals have adapted to perpetual darkness by evolving a multitude of traits. The most common and most studied cave characteristics are the regression of eyes and the overall reduction in pigmentation. Studying these traits can provide important insights into how evolutionary forces drive convergent and regressive adaptation. The blind Mexican cavefish (Astyanax mexicanus) has emerged as a useful model to study cave evolution owing to the availability of genetic and genomic resources, and the amenability of embryonic development as the different populations remain fertile with each other. In this review, we give an overview of our current knowledge underlying the process of regressive and convergent evolution using eye degeneration in cavefish as an example.

Stickleback fish, including the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), have been at the forefront of research to uncover the genetic and molecular architecture that underlies phenotypic diversity and adaptation. A wealth of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping studies in sticklebacks have provided insight into longstanding questions about the distribution of effect sizes during adaptation as well as the role of genetic linkage in facilitating adaptation. These QTL mapping studies have also provided a basis for the identification of the genes that underlie phenotypic diversity. These data have revealed that mutations in regulatory elements play an important role in the evolution of phenotypic diversity in sticklebacks. Genetic and molecular studies in sticklebacks have also led to new insights on the genetic basis of repeated evolution and suggest that the same loci are involved about half of the time when the same phenotypes evolve independently. When the same locus is involved, selection on standing variation and repeated mutation of the same genes have both contributed to the evolution of similar phenotypes in independent populations.

Sir Richard Owen also took great care to highlight each of the elements of the forelimb and hindlimb in a multitude of species with focused attention on the homology between the hoof of the horse and the middle digit of man. The ensuing decades brought about a convergence of palaeontology, experimental embryology and molecular biology to lend further support to the homologies of tetrapod limbs and their developmental origins. However, for all that we now understand about the conserved mechanisms of limb development and the development of gross morphological disturbances, little of what is presented in the experimental or medical literature reflects the remarkable diversity resulting from the 450 million year experiment of natural selection. An understanding of conserved and divergent limb morphologies in this new age of genomics and genome engineering promises to reveal more of the developmental potential residing in all limbs and to unravel the mechanisms of evolutionary variation in limb size and shape. In this review, we present the current state of our rapidly advancing understanding of the evolutionary origin of hands and feet and highlight what is known about the mechanisms that shape diverse limbs.

In this theme issue, we celebrate how evolutionary studies on the origins of morphological diversity have changed over the past 350 years since the first publication of the Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society. Current understanding of this topic is enriched by many disciplines, including anatomy, palaeontology, developmental biology, genetics and genomics. Development is central because it is the means by which genetic information of an organism is translated into morphology. The discovery of the genetic basis of development has revealed how changes in form can be inherited, leading to the emergence of the field known as evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo). Recent approaches include imaging, quantitative morphometrics and, in particular, genomics, which brings a new dimension. Articles in this issue illustrate the contemporary evo-devo field by considering general principles emerging from genomics and how this and other approaches are applied to specific questions about the evolution of major transitions and innovations in morphology, diversification and modification of structures, intraspecific morphological variation and developmental plasticity. Current approaches enable a much broader range of organisms to be studied, thus building a better appreciation of the origins of morphological diversity.

The distinctions between homologous or non-homologous structures have become blurred, however, as modern evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) has shown that novel features often result from modification of pre-existing developmental modules, rather than arising completely de novo. With this realization in mind, the term 'deep homology' was coined, in recognition of the remarkably conserved gene expression during the development of certain animal structures that would not be considered homologous by previous strict definitions. At its core, it can help to formulate an understanding of deeper layers of ontogenetic conservation for anatomical features that lack any clear phylogenetic continuity. Here, we review deep homology and related concepts in the context of a gene expression-based homology discussion. We then focus on how these conceptual frameworks have profited from the recent rise of high-throughput next-generation sequencing. These techniques have greatly expanded the range of organisms amenable to such studies. Moreover, they helped to elevate the traditional gene-by-gene comparison to a transcriptome-wide level. We will end with an outlook on the next challenges in the field and how technological advances might provide exciting new strategies to tackle these questions.

However, research on their biology, ecology and behaviour to develop management tactics is hampered by the lack of reliable attacks on experimental trees. Injecting Magnolia virginiana L. with ethanol consistently induced attacks by exotic ambrosia beetles to facilitate research on their biology and management. The ability to attract ambrosia beetles to trap trees may be useful for developing nonchemical strategies and techniques for managing them in nurseries. However, to be useful in management techniques, ethanol-injection has to reliably induce attacks on a vlariety of tree species. Experiments were conducted in Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia, where ethanol-injection was tested on 16 species of deciduous trees from 11 families. Ethanol-injection reliably induced attacks by exotic ambrosia beetles on all tree species tested. There were differences in the numbers of attacks by ambrosia beetles among species of trees in most experiments, although no species was identified consistently as the most or least attacked in repeated experiments. The positive association of attacks with ethanol concentrations in bark tissue indicate that the attack rates were most likely related to the uptake and emission of ethanol. The results of the present study indicate that ethanol-injection reliably induces ambrosia beetle attacks on a wide range of deciduous tree species, which should further facilitate research on ambrosia beetles in nurseries and the development of behaviour-based management tactics that divert ambrosia beetles away from ornamental trees.","Author":"","Title":"Ethanol-injection induces attacks by ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) on a variety of tree species","ReviewID":"26","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"2.0","Content":"Manipulation of the reproductive activity of jackals is dependent on a thorough understanding of the reproductive biology of this species.

Laminin was immunolocalized in basement membranes surrounding seminiferous tubules, as well as in basement membranes associated with Leydig, peritubular myoid and vascular smooth muscle cells. Scalloped basement membranes enclosed seminiferous tubules in regressing testes. The seminiferous epithelium and interstitial tissue in all animals studied were cytokeratin immunonegative. Smooth muscle actin was demonstrated in vascular smooth muscle cells, as well as in peritubular myoid cells encircling seminiferous tubules. Vimentin immunoreactivity was exhibited in the cytoplasm of Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, vascular endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and fibrocytes. Vimentin immunostaining in Sertoli, Leydig and peritubular myoid cells varied depending on the functional state of the testis.

Increased levels of heat shock proteins have been associated with multiple cancers and are being studied as potential therapeutic targets. The purpose of this study was to determine the expression levels of heat shock proteins 90 and 70 and of glucose related protein 78 in medullary thyroid carcinoma tissues compared with normal thyroid tissues. Methods: 20 tissue specimens of medullary thyroid carcinoma and 10 specimens of thyroids without malignancy were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Results: Medullary thyroid carcinoma specimens showed 27% higher expression level of heat shock protein 90 immunostaining, and a 43% higher expression level of heat shock protein 70 immunostaining versus normal controls. These differences, however, were not statistically significant. A significantly higher expression level was noted for glucose related protein 78 in the medullary thyroid carcinoma specimens than in the controls. Conclusion: This study indicates increased expression levels of heat shock proteins 90 and 70 and glucose related protein 78 levels in medullary thyroid carcinoma.

Previous studies have shown that young people in rural Thailand have low levels of knowledge on HIV/AIDS and high sexual risks. We compared sexual behaviors between the lowland Thai youth and the youth from ethnic minority groups. Methods and findings This is a cross-sectional quantitative study conducted among high-school Thai and ethnic students in Chiang Mai. From a total 1215 participants, 487 (40.1%) were lowland Thai and 728 (59.9%) were from ethnic minorities. Overall, 17.9% of respondents reported \"ever had sex.\" Lowland Thai adolescents were more likely to have ever had sex compared with ethnic minority adolescents (AOR, 1.61; CI, 1.06-2.45; P<0.01). A higher proportion of lowland Thai respondents reported having >= 2 lifetime sexual partners (51.9% vs. 33.3%, P= 0.003), or currently having a boy/girlfriend (59.9% vs. 45.3%, P< 0.001) compared to ethnic minority adolescents. Consistent condom use was low in both groups (22.6%). The common significant factors associated with \"ever had sex\" in both groups were \"ever drunk alcohol in the past year\" and \"currently having a boy/girlfriend.\" Specifically, for lowland Thai youth, being around the age of 17 or 18 years and \"ever used methamphetamine in the past year\" were associated with increased odds of \"ever had sex\". For ethnic minority adolescents, being female and belonging to religions other than Buddhism were associated with decreased odds of \"ever had sex\". Conclusion A substantially higher proportion of lowland Thai engage in risky sexual behaviors when compared to ethnic minorities.

In the history of the development of Chinese Buddhist Philosophy, several Buddhist scholars of the mainstream schools based on Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa as a reference in their theoretical construction undesignedly, and their interpretative standpoints generated an important influence in later generations. Since Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa is one of the sources in the interpretation and development of Chinese Buddhist Philosophy, and if we can take a closer inspection into the interpretative standpoints of those influential scholars, a different approach to the reflection and discussion might be offered to the argumentation of Chinese Buddhist Philosophy from the widely accepted course of Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa in China. The scopes of studies expanded how Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa influenced the interpretations of Chinese Buddhist Philosophy are quite extensive, so this paper only focuses on Ji-zang (549-623 C.E.) as the main case. Aiming on Ji-zang's concrete interpretations of Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa as a foundation, this paper attempts to introspect and sort out the interpretative activities of the interpreter from his perspectives, and in addition to that, figures out the religious dimensions hidden behind the interpretative 1 activities of Ji-zang. The conclusion of this paper pointed out that the influences of Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa on the interpretations of Ji-zang can be classified into two aspects which is the theoretical and the practical respectively. On the theoretical aspect, Ji-zang usually cited some of the viewpoints of Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa and interpreted on it, at the same time, used it to criticize the assertions of the schools which holds incompatible argumentation. On the practical aspect, Ji-zang particularly highlighted the significance of \"no gain (wusuode)\", which not only manifested the peculiarly Buddhist religious practice of self deconstruction, Ji-zang also applied it in his interpretations and discriminations of Buddhist philosophical theory. And these are regarded as a practice of interpretations that is accompanied by religious practice.","Author":"","Title":"How Mahaprajnaparamitopadesa Influenced the Interpretations of Chinese Buddhism? - A Case of Ji-zang","ReviewID":"17","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Motivations for human sacrifice are explained from various perspectives: the sociopolitical benefits gained by elite hosts and the ideological, cultural, or locally unique factors that motivate community members and victims of sacrifice to participate. While these perspectives are pertinent, in this paper we employ a political economic framework to investigate how retainer sacrifice was practiced over two centuries in the ancient kingdom of Silla in Korea and why it was ultimately banned. We suggest that retainer sacrifice rites can be regarded as public goods supplied by elite hosts and consumed by the public at large. On a regional scale, the supply of retainer sacrifice was maintained by an oligopolistic or cartel like market structure, which shaped sociopolitical relations among Silla royalty, elites, and communities. Rising costs of retainer sacrifice and an opportunistic strategy of the central government to monopolize the religious market brought about the illegalization of retainer sacrifice followed by the adoption of Buddhism as a state religion.

A monk's cultural position within Burmese Buddhism particularly strengthens his authority when he frames his preaching and actions as a defense of Buddhism. Without attention to these cultural institutions and the religious authority they confer, the resonance and influence of monks' words cannot be completely understood.

Computational intelligence approaches are suitable when the data to be modelled are too complex for conventional statistical techniques to process quickly and efficiently. These advanced approaches are based on mathematical models that have been especially developed for dealing with the uncertainty and imprecision which is typically found in clinical and biological datasets. This paper provides a survey of recent work on computational intelligence approaches that have been applied to prostate cancer predictive modeling, and considers the challenges which need to be addressed. In particular, the paper considers a broad definition of computational intelligence which includes metaheuristic optimisation algorithms (also known as nature inspired algorithms), Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Fuzzy based approaches, and hybrids of these, as well as Bayesian based approaches, and Markov models. Metaheuristic optimisation approaches, such as the Ant Colony Optimisation, Particle Swarm Optimisation, and Artificial Immune Network have been utilised for optimising the performance of prostate cancer predictive models, and the suitability of these approaches are discussed.

While multi-objective optimization itself can be a challenging task, equally difficult is the ability to make sense of the obtained solutions. In this two-part paper, we deal with data mining methods that can be applied to extract knowledge about multi-objective optimization problems from the solutions generated during optimization. This knowledge is expected to provide deeper insights about the problem to the decision maker, in addition to assisting the optimization process in future design iterations through an expert system. The current paper surveys several existing data mining methods and classifies them by methodology and type of knowledge discovered. Most of these methods come from the domain of exploratory data analysis and can be applied to any multivariate data. We specifically look at methods that can generate explicit knowledge in a machine-usable form. A framework for knowledge-driven optimization is proposed, which involves both online and offline elements of knowledge discovery. One of the conclusions of this survey is that while there are a number of data mining methods that can deal with data involving continuous variables, only a few ad hoc methods exist that can provide explicit knowledge when the variables involved are of a discrete nature. Part B of this paper proposes new techniques that can be used with such datasets and applies them to discrete variable multi-objective problems related to production systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

An average measure of complexity of the EEG signal obtained by permutation entropy (PE) is also included. The dimensionality of the feature space is reduced through a multilayer processing system based on the recently emerged deep learning (DL) concept. The DL processor includes a stacked auto-encoder, trained by unsupervised learning techniques, and a classifier whose parameters are determined in a supervised way by associating the known category labels to the reduced vector of high-level features generated by the previous processing blocks. The supervised learning step is carried out by using either support vector machines (SVM) or multilayer neural networks (MLP-NN). A subset of EEG from patients suffering from Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and healthy controls (HC) is considered for differentiating CJD patients. When fine-tuning the parameters of the global processing system by a supervised learning procedure, the proposed system is able to achieve an average accuracy of 89%, an average sensitivity of 92%, and an average specificity of 89% in differentiating CJD from RPD.

This claim is secured by the ample evidence of both wide-and deep-rooted alternative concepts on the topic. Didactic transposition is a theory that comes from a reflection on the teaching and learning process in mathematics but has been used in other disciplinary fields. It will be used in this work in order to clear up the main obstacles in the teaching-learning process of geometric optics. We proceed to argue that since Newton's approach to optics, in his Book I of Opticks, is independent of the corpuscular or undulatory nature of light, it is the most suitable for a constructivist learning environment. However, Newton's theory must be subject to a proper didactic transposition to help overcome the referred alternative concepts. Then is described our didactic transposition in order to create knowledge to be taught using a dialogical process between students' previous knowledge, history of optics and the desired outcomes on geometrical optics in an elementary pre-service teacher training course.

Traditional automatic speech recognition (ASR) research requires considerable computational resources and has slow experimental turnaround times. Our goal is to introduce these new datasets to researchers in the ASR and machine learning communities in order to facilitate the development of novel speech recognition techniques on smaller but still acoustically rich, diverse, and hence interesting corpora. We select these corpora to maximize an acoustic quality criterion while limiting the vocabulary size (from 10 words up to 10,000 words), where both \"acoustic quality\" and vocabulary size are adeptly measured via various submodular functions. We also survey numerous submodular functions that could be useful to measure both \"acoustic quality\" and \"corpus complexity\" and offer guidelines on when and why a scientist may wish use to one vs. another. The corpora selection process itself is naturally performed using various state-of-the-art submodular function optimization procedures, including submodular level-set constrained submodular optimization (SCSC/SCSK), difference-of-submodular (DS) optimization, and unconstrained submodular minimization (SFM), all of which are fully defined herein. While the focus of this paper is on the resultant speech corpora, and the survey of possible objectives, a consequence of the paper is a thorough empirical comparison of the relative merits of these modern submodular optimization procedures.

We performed a controlled fishing experiment targeting northern pike (Esox lucius) in a small (25 ha), weakly eutrophic natural lake situated about 80 km northeast of Berlin (Germany) to understand abiotic, biotic and gear-related factors that relate to catch rates and size of pike captured by angling. The experiment was conducted over two one-week long fishing campaigns where boat-based anglers randomly sampled across 30 pre-determined sites. Sites were systematically exposed to two standardized lure types (soft plastic shad or spoon). We found the catch rates of pike per 15 min to be significantly higher in shallow water and when soft plastic lures were used compared to deeper water and when spoons were used. Catch rates significantly dropped over the course of seven days, suggesting either learning or other reasons moving pike from vulnerable to invulnerable pools (e.g., due to stress caused by capture, sampling and release). Catch rates also varied by season and across anglers and sites as random effects. The variation in size of pike captured exhibited greater stochasticity than variation in catch rate. There was no lure effect on the size of the pike captured, but we found a seasonal effect and a day effect, suggesting larger fish were captured first. Pike captured in sublittoral areas were significantly smaller than those captured in other habitats. Overall, our study documented a novel effect of lure type on the catch rates of pike, but the explanatory power of the predictors was only moderate. Therefore, our results support the idea that the best fishing ingredients are investing time and maximizing encounter probabilities through habitat choice, with only moderate additional effects to be expected from attention to abiotic conditions, day time and choice of type of artificial lure.

ENAE is a stochastic version of an AE that adds noise to the input text and selects the top sentences from an ensemble of noisy runs. In each individual experiment of the ensemble, a different randomly generated noise is added to the input representation. This architecture changes the application of the AE from a deterministic feed-forward network to a stochastic runtime model. Experiments show that the AE using local vocabularies clearly provide a more discriminative feature space and improves the recall on average 11.2%.

This new framework was developed and positively applied to the company in a five-year experience to face the complex transition process, thus advancing the knowledge from social science for innovation and sustainability management challenges.

In the first part of this study, we provide a survey of more than 200 reports in this field with a focus on schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), depressive disorders, autism spectrum disease (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Detailed information about those studies such as sample size, type and number of extracted features and reported accuracy are summarized and discussed.

However, the structural complexity of most temperate watersheds (i.e. connections among shallow soils, deep aquifers, the atmosphere and streams) and the dynamic seasonal changes that occur within them (i.e., plant senescence which impacts evapotranspiration) create significant challenges to characterizing or quantifying hydrologic connectivity. The McMurdo Dry Valleys, a polar desert in Antarctica, provide a unique opportunity to study hydrologic connectivity because there is no vegetative cover (and therefore no transpiration), and no deep aquifers connected to surface soils or streams. Glacier melt provides stream flow to well-established channels and closed-basin, ice-covered lakes on the valley floor. Streams are also connected to shallow hyporheic zones along their lengths, which are bounded at similar to 75 cm depth by ice-cemented permafrost. These hydrologic features and connections provide water for and underpin biological communities. Hence, exchange of water among them provides a vector for exchange of energy and dissolved solutes. Connectivity is dynamic on timescales of a day to a flow season (6-12 weeks), as streamflow varies over these timescales. The timescales over which these connections occur is also dynamic. Exchanges between streams and hyporheic zones, for example, have been estimated to be as short as hours to as long as several weeks. These exchanges have significant implications for the biogeochemistry of these systems and the biotic communities in each feature. Here we evaluate the lessons we can learn about hydrologic connectivity in the MDV watersheds that are simplified in the context of processes occurring and water reservoirs included in the landscape, yet are sensitive to climate controls and contain substantial physical heterogeneity. We specifically explore several metrics that are simple and/or commonly employed in hydrologic analyses and interpret them in the context of connectivity between and among hydrologic features.

Based on the bibliometric statistics, the paper reviews the research development of geopolitics on the Web of Science from 1996 to 2015. The history, journals, papers and key research areas of geopolitics have been revealed in the paper. By the analysis of bibliometric statistics, the number of papers recently published in the journals of political geography and related geography journals continues to increase. The key areas of geopolitical papers which are globally highly cited include geopolitical interpretation of the countries and borders, critical geopolitics, emotional geopolitics, feminist geopolitics and other topics. Before the year of 2000, the state and borders were hot topics of the geopolitical research. Yet since 2000, it has been the trend that the geopolitics is increasingly set in the context of geographical implications. At the same time, critical geopolitics appears to be the main area of geopolitical research, especially transitioning from traditional geopolitics towards the humanism-embeddedness (such as emotional geopolitics, feminist geopolitics). The paper then systematically reviews the branch trends of geopolitical research, including the borders and the territory, global geo-culture and geo-economics, Chinese models of geopolitics, resource conflicts and ecological politics, as well as emotional geopolitics.

On the basis of potential energy distribution detailed vibrational assignments of observed FT-IR and FT-Raman bands have been proposed. Using molecular electrostatic potential map relative reactivities towards electrophilic and nucleophilic attack are predicted. The first and second hyperpolarizabilities are calculated and the first hyperpolarizability of the title compounds are greater than that of the standard NLO material urea. Molecular studies reveal that the predicted binding affinities of the best poses were -8.7 kcal/mol for BACPC, -9.0 kcal/mol for CBACPC, and -8.8 kcal/mol for the original inhibitor. Efforts were made in order to investigate local reactivity properties of title compounds as well. In order to do so we have calculated average local ionization energy (ALIE) surfaces, Fukui functions, bond dissociation energies (BDE) (within the framework of DFT calculations) and radial distribution functions (RDF) (within the molecular dynamics simulations). ALIE surfaces and Fukui functions gave us initial information on the site reactivity towards electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks.

And gender is considered as the moderating factor in the model. Using 215 valid data from the WeChat users in China, the model is empirically assessed by PLS-SEM. Results show that three types of gratifications positively affect WeChat users' liking behavior: hedonic gratification (enjoyment), social gratification (social support) and utilitarian gratification (information seeking). In particular, enjoyment plays the most important role in determining the liking behavior, followed by social support and information seeking.

Digital piracy is the unauthorized and illegal digital copying or distribution of digital goods, such as music, movies, and software. To date, researchers have used disparate theories and models to understand individuals' motivations for stealing and sharing digital content. To establish a unified understanding of digital piracy research in order to set an agenda for future studies, we conducted a meta-analysis of the literature. We analyzed 257 unique studies with a total of 126,622 participants to examine all the major constructs and covariates used in the literature. Using social cognitive theory, we were able to resolve several contradictions and trade-offs found in the digital piracy literature. Further, our meta-analytic results suggest that four key sets of factors maximize prediction: (1) outcome expectancies (considerations of rewards, perceived risks, and perceived sanctions), (2) social learning (positive and negative social influence and piracy habit), (3) self-efficacy and self-regulation (perceived behavioral control and low self-control), and (4) moral disengagement (morality, immorality, and neutralization).

This awareness has resulted in a research stream focused on the performance of protective behaviors. We contribute to this research stream by extending an oft-cited theory in the information security literature-protection motivation theory (PMT)-to include the relationship of insiders' psychological capital (PsyCap) with the mechanisms of PMT. PsyCap is a construct of role-breadth psychological capacities and resources embodying important work-related motivational resources. Therefore, given the varied facets central to PMT, determining the relationship of PsyCap with each distinct PMT mechanism is an important contribution. Furthermore, prior research has established that individuals can develop their PsyCap. Consequently, considering the relationship of role-breadth PsyCap with the PMT mechanisms provides an important and malleable, motivational antecedent that complements PMT and is absent from most assessments of the contemporary PMT model. We find support for PsyCap's relationship with the mechanisms of PMT and suggest opportunities to develop PsyCap in conjunction with other organizational security efforts. We present our findings, discuss their implications for research and practice, and highlight several opportunities for future research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This gap between behavior and concern is called the privacy paradox. Several theories have been explored to explain this, but with inconsistent and incomplete results. This study investigates the paradox using a construal level theory lens.

Results from a field survey suggest that all push (risk), pull (trust, critical mass) and mooring (switching cost, social norm) factors each have direct impacts on switching intention. Mooring factors fail to moderate the impact of push factor on switching intention, but they are able to moderate the effects of pull factors on switching intention.

Moreover, the vast amount of online health information some of it of dubious quality makes the task of finding relevant information difficult. Therefore, this experiment also tested an approach to improving the online health information seeking process by tailoring search engine results about influenza to the emotional action tendencies of users. This study finds varied effects for different post-search discrete emotions (fear, hope, contentment, interest, and inspiration) and explores how social cognitive mediators and perceived relevance shape post-search attitudes and behaviors.

Then, the capability to interoperate as a property of the system, is defined as a complex ability to seamlessly sense and perceive a stimulus from its environment (assumingly, a message from any other system), make an informed decision about this perception and consequently, articulate a meaningful and useful action or response, based on this decision. Although this capability is defined on the basis of the existing interoperability theories, the proposed approach to its definition excludes the assumption on the awareness of co-existence of two interoperating systems. Thus, it establishes the links between the research of interoperability of systems and intelligent software agents, as one of the systems' digital identities.","Author":"","Title":"On the formal definition of the systems' interoperability capability: an anthropomorphic approach","ReviewID":"17","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"The effective deployment of enterprise systems has been a major challenge for many organisations. Customising the new system, changing business processes, and integrating multiple information sources are all difficult tasks. As such, they are typically done in carefully planned stages in a process known as phased implementation. Using ideas from Option Theory, this article critiques aspects of phased implementation. One customer relationship management (CRM) project and its phased implementation are described in detail and ten other enterprise system deployments are summarised as a basis for the observation that almost all deployment stages are pre-defined operational steps rather than decision points. However, Option Theory suggests that optional stages, to be used only when risk materialises, should be integral parts of project plans. Although such optional stages are often more valuable than pre-defined stages, the evidence presented in this article shows that they are only rarely utilised. Therefore, a simple framework is presented; it first identifies risks related to the deployment of enterprise systems, then identifies optional stages that can mitigate these risks, and finally compares the costs and benefits of both pre-defined and optional stages.","Author":"","Title":"Pre-defined and optional staging for the deployment of enterprise systems: a case study and a framework","ReviewID":"18","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Previous research demonstrated that mere instructions to approach one stimulus and avoid another stimulus result in an implicit preference for the to-be-approached over the to-be-avoided stimulus.

Consistent with the propositional account, Experiment 1 showed that avoidance instructions had a negative effect on implicit evaluations over and above the positive effect of approach instructions. Consistent with the associative self-anchoring account, Experiment 2 showed that changes in implicit self-stimulus linking mediated AA instruction effects on implicit evaluations. However, mediation was only partial, in that AA instructions showed a significant effect on implicit evaluations after controlling for implicit self-stimulus linking. Together, the results support the contribution of propositional processes to AA instruction effects; the results remain ambiguous regarding an additional contribution of associative self-anchoring.

These features of GSMA beam scattered spectrum could be used to obtain information about the structure of a deterministic medium.","Author":"","Title":"Spectral shifts generated by scattering of Gaussian Schell-model arrays beam from a deterministic medium","ReviewID":"6","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Using density functional theory technique in the B3LYP approximation and cc-pVDZ (5D, 7F) basis set, the molecular structural parameters and vibrational wave numbers of two cyanopyrazine-2-carboxamide derivatives have been investigated. On the basis of potential energy distribution detailed vibrational assignments of observed FT-IR and FT-Raman bands have been proposed. Using molecular electrostatic potential map relative reactivities towards electrophilic and nucleophilic attack are predicted. The first and second hyperpolarizabilities are calculated and the first hyperpolarizability of the title compounds are greater than that of the standard NLO material urea. Molecular studies reveal that the predicted binding affinities of the best poses were -8.7 kcal/mol for BACPC, -9.0 kcal/mol for CBACPC, and -8.8 kcal/mol for the original inhibitor. Efforts were made in order to investigate local reactivity properties of title compounds as well. In order to do so we have calculated average local ionization energy (ALIE) surfaces, Fukui functions, bond dissociation energies (BDE) (within the framework of DFT calculations) and radial distribution functions (RDF) (within the molecular dynamics simulations). ALIE surfaces and Fukui functions gave us initial information on the site reactivity towards electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks. BDE indicated locations that might be prone to autoxidation mechanism, while RDF indicated which atoms of title molecules are having pronounced interactions with water. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Yet there has been a lack of research and understanding of the factors that motivate users to click \"like\" in social media. In this study, based on the uses and gratifications theory, a research model is developed to examine what factors affecting users' liking behavior in WeChat. And gender is considered as the moderating factor in the model. Using 215 valid data from the WeChat users in China, the model is empirically assessed by PLS-SEM. Results show that three types of gratifications positively affect WeChat users' liking behavior: hedonic gratification (enjoyment), social gratification (social support) and utilitarian gratification (information seeking). In particular, enjoyment plays the most important role in determining the liking behavior, followed by social support and information seeking. In addition, gender acts as the moderator on the relationship between each gratification and liking behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Its successful implementation depends on users' acceptance. However, no study exists exploring the factors that influence students' acceptance of mobile-based assessment. Furthermore, research that combines acceptance with motivational factors is limited. The current study builds on the theoretical framework of the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) of Motivation and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and proposes the Mobile Based Assessment-Motivational and Acceptance Model (MBA-MAM), a combined model that explains and predicts Behavioral Intention to Use Mobile-based Assessment. One-hundred and forty students (N = 140) from a European senior-level secondary school participated in mobile-assisted assessment activities and self-reported their perceptions about MBA afterwards. Structured equation modeling used to analyze quantitative survey data. The study confirmed the proposed model, explaining and predicting students' intention to use MBA in terms of both acceptance and motivational (autonomy, competence and relatedness) factors. The study provides a better understanding towards the development of mobile-based assessments by relating acceptance and motivational factors into an integrated model. Implications are discussed within the wider context of mobile learning acceptance research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Digital piracy is the unauthorized and illegal digital copying or distribution of digital goods, such as music, movies, and software. To date, researchers have used disparate theories and models to understand individuals' motivations for stealing and sharing digital content. To establish a unified understanding of digital piracy research in order to set an agenda for future studies, we conducted a meta-analysis of the literature. We analyzed 257 unique studies with a total of 126,622 participants to examine all the major constructs and covariates used in the literature. Using social cognitive theory, we were able to resolve several contradictions and trade-offs found in the digital piracy literature. Further, our meta-analytic results suggest that four key sets of factors maximize prediction: (1) outcome expectancies (considerations of rewards, perceived risks, and perceived sanctions), (2) social learning (positive and negative social influence and piracy habit), (3) self-efficacy and self-regulation (perceived behavioral control and low self-control), and (4) moral disengagement (morality, immorality, and neutralization). Based on our results, we describe several patterns in the literature that suggest opportunities to further synthesize the literature and expand the boundaries of digital piracy research.

Analyzed data shows that the moderating impact of trust was significant in one path, which was perceived desirability (stemming from the diffusion of innovation theory and representing the technological view). Trust did not moderate the impacts of organizational and environmental variables. The findings provided insights into how existing relationships between trading partners may not be flexible enough to absorb new technology.

This awareness has resulted in a research stream focused on the performance of protective behaviors. We contribute to this research stream by extending an oft-cited theory in the information security literature-protection motivation theory (PMT)-to include the relationship of insiders' psychological capital (PsyCap) with the mechanisms of PMT. PsyCap is a construct of role-breadth psychological capacities and resources embodying important work-related motivational resources. Therefore, given the varied facets central to PMT, determining the relationship of PsyCap with each distinct PMT mechanism is an important contribution. Furthermore, prior research has established that individuals can develop their PsyCap. Consequently, considering the relationship of role-breadth PsyCap with the PMT mechanisms provides an important and malleable, motivational antecedent that complements PMT and is absent from most assessments of the contemporary PMT model. We find support for PsyCap's relationship with the mechanisms of PMT and suggest opportunities to develop PsyCap in conjunction with other organizational security efforts. We present our findings, discuss their implications for research and practice, and highlight several opportunities for future research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Online social networks are perceived to provide individuals new benefits and have led to a surge Of personal data uploaded, stored, and shared. While privacy concerns are a major issue for many users of social networking sites, studies have shown that their information disclosing behavior does not align with their concerns. This gap between behavior and concern is called the privacy paradox. Several theories have been explored to explain this, but with inconsistent and incomplete results. This study investigates the paradox using a construal level theory lens. We show how a privacy breach, not yet experienced and psychologically distant, has less weight in everyday choices than more concrete and psychologically-near social networking activities and discuss the implications for research and practice.

Prior studies largely focused on users' early adoption of cloud storage services, continual usage of the services and users' willingness to pay. However, limited attention has been paid to switching behaviors. In the Chinese market, as services provided by different platforms become homogeneous, non-functional factors are expected to play an important role in affecting users' selection of services. Based on the push-pull mooring framework, we propose a research model by incorporating four factors: risk, trust, switching cost and social influences (critical mass and social norm). Results from a field survey suggest that all push (risk), pull (trust, critical mass) and mooring (switching cost, social norm) factors each have direct impacts on switching intention. Mooring factors fail to moderate the impact of push factor on switching intention, but they are able to moderate the effects of pull factors on switching intention. The results yield both theoretical and practical implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To accomplish their goals, these organizations strive to appear credible to target audiences. Metzger, Flanagin, and Medders' (2010) theory of online credibility assessment explains that Internet users rely on peripheral cues to determine whether website information is credible or not. We conducted two studies to test this theory in an online ideological environment. In addition, we investigated how website viewers' pre-existing attitudes regarding the ideological topic affects how they perceive the messages presented on these websites. Results of this research found that this theory partially extends to ideological settings. However, participants did not attribute credibility to ideological topics on a uniform basis.

However, scholarship has yet to carefully examine how online health information seelcing contributes to post-search health behaviors, including the sharing of information found during the search with others. Combining insights from the appraisal theory of emotions and social cognitive theory, this study used a naturalistic experiment (N = 380) to test a model of the role of post-search emotions in shaping post search cognitions and behavior in the context of influenza. Moreover, the vast amount of online health information some of it of dubious quality makes the task of finding relevant information difficult. Therefore, this experiment also tested an approach to improving the online health information seeking process by tailoring search engine results about influenza to the emotional action tendencies of users. This study finds varied effects for different post-search discrete emotions (fear, hope, contentment, interest, and inspiration) and explores how social cognitive mediators and perceived relevance shape post-search attitudes and behaviors. The results underscore the importance of studying discrete emotional reactions to online health information in order to better predict the attitudinal and behavioral outcomes of this popular avenue for acquiring health information.

In response to this, the problem of systems' interoperability is revisited by taking into the account the different aspects of philosophy, psychology, linguistics and artificial intelligence, namely by analysing the potential analogies between the processes of human and system communication. Then, the capability to interoperate as a property of the system, is defined as a complex ability to seamlessly sense and perceive a stimulus from its environment (assumingly, a message from any other system), make an informed decision about this perception and consequently, articulate a meaningful and useful action or response, based on this decision. Although this capability is defined on the basis of the existing interoperability theories, the proposed approach to its definition excludes the assumption on the awareness of co-existence of two interoperating systems. Thus, it establishes the links between the research of interoperability of systems and intelligent software agents, as one of the systems' digital identities.","Author":"","Title":"On the formal definition of the systems' interoperability capability: an anthropomorphic approach","ReviewID":"17","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"The effective deployment of enterprise systems has been a major challenge for many organisations. Customising the new system, changing business processes, and integrating multiple information sources are all difficult tasks. As such, they are typically done in carefully planned stages in a process known as phased implementation. Using ideas from Option Theory, this article critiques aspects of phased implementation. One customer relationship management (CRM) project and its phased implementation are described in detail and ten other enterprise system deployments are summarised as a basis for the observation that almost all deployment stages are pre-defined operational steps rather than decision points. However, Option Theory suggests that optional stages, to be used only when risk materialises, should be integral parts of project plans. Although such optional stages are often more valuable than pre-defined stages, the evidence presented in this article shows that they are only rarely utilised. Therefore, a simple framework is presented; it first identifies risks related to the deployment of enterprise systems, then identifies optional stages that can mitigate these risks, and finally compares the costs and benefits of both pre-defined and optional stages.","Author":"","Title":"Pre-defined and optional staging for the deployment of enterprise systems: a case study and a framework","ReviewID":"18","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Previous research demonstrated that mere instructions to approach one stimulus and avoid another stimulus result in an implicit preference for the to-be-approached over the to-be-avoided stimulus. To investigate the mechanisms underlying approach-avoidance (AA) instruction effects, we tested predictions of a propositional account and an associative self-anchoring account in a preregistered adversarial collaboration. Consistent with the propositional account, Experiment 1 showed that avoidance instructions had a negative effect on implicit evaluations over and above the positive effect of approach instructions. Consistent with the associative self-anchoring account, Experiment 2 showed that changes in implicit self-stimulus linking mediated AA instruction effects on implicit evaluations. However, mediation was only partial, in that AA instructions showed a significant effect on implicit evaluations after controlling for implicit self-stimulus linking. Together, the results support the contribution of propositional processes to AA instruction effects; the results remain ambiguous regarding an additional contribution of associative self-anchoring.

Remember responses involve eyewitness identification of the target person as an episodic memory task, because it implies retrieving information about the target person in the place and at the time of the event. Know responses, in contrast, engage recognition based on familiarity or perceptual facilitation, that is, as a semantic memory task. To explore the relation between retrieval experiences and recognition accuracy, 86 participants took part in a recognition task with two conditions: one with an interpolated target absent line-up and the other only with the target present line-up. Accuracy of recognition and retrieval experience was measured. The results showed that, having previously participated in a target-absent line-up, increased omissions, while the number of hits decreased. Furthermore, participants' know responses were associated to false recognition, whilst remember responses were associated to hits in recognition. Thus, asking eyewitnesses to inform about the kind of retrieval experience in which they based their recognition responses, may serve as a reliable indicator of accuracy in recognition.

Design/methodology/approach - The approach to development of UKPMC has been consultative and iterative. Through surveys, focus groups and one-to-one user tests the aim has been to develop a service which can fit neatly into a researcher's workflow. Coordinating the programme itself has required close collaboration between organisations which are quite diverse both culturally and administratively. Findings - Through developing UKPMC, technology has been melded together with practical delivery. The text mining functionality that the service now offers is truly innovative, and there is further potential to develop this. The recently launched Beta service (beta.ukpmc.ac.uk) will continue to be honed particularly its text mining functionality through ongoing user consultation and feedback. It is perceived that this flexible approach to development is essential in offering a service that is truly useful for the UK's life sciences research community and offers a compelling reason to use it as a valid and ground breaking alternative to Pub Med Central (the US version).

The results of both Phase I and Phase II of this investigation can be integrated in one single solution package for the end-user, combining fast decisions making and operational features. The final part of this paper describes the 'helmet-mounted' data recall visor methodology which allows the surgeon to access to a data base for information retrival during the course of an operation without interrupting the surgical case itself. This particularly interesting application allows the surgeon to consult a centrally-located data base which contains important information regarding similar clinical cases, choice of laserbeam profiles and focal lengths, simulation of beam behaviours, performances and other data. The on-line and direct access to the data base supports him in all those borderline situations in the O.R. in which the laser device type and configuration/calibration play a decive role in the success of the operation. Also, the helmet-mounted display frees surgeon's hands in order to allow him to continue the operation while consulting the data base on-line, thus speeding up decision processes regarding changes of laser set-up, general calibration optimization and remote clinical consultancy.","Author":"","Title":"Proposal of a computerized algorithm for continuous wave CO2 laser on-line control during orthopaedic surgery .2. simplified algorithm version (LCA-s) and helmet-mounted data access device solution","ReviewID":"28","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"The word 'reference process' is used to refer to the entire process of reference transaction.

Many of these reports relate to breakthroughs in materials science, including fabrication of new 2-D materials such as graphene oxide, and structured materials such as metal organic frameworks. Interestingly, the ultra-high permeances described are invariably measured for flat sheet membranes, in highly dilute systems. The effects of pressure gradients across the membrane, and the effects of concentration polarisation at significant, real world concentrations are not usually considered. In practise, membrane modules, rather than flat membrane sheets, are used in industrial processes. In concentrated systems, employing modules, concentration polarisation and module pressure drops will also affect overall process performance. This work examines the extent to which increasing membrane permeance can impact on processes employing membrane modules, considering both spiral-wound and hollow fibre configurations. Our key conclusion is that ultra-high permeance membranes will not be able to make a significant impact on process efficiency with current module designs; and our recommendation is that fresh research into module and process design is required.","Author":"","Title":"Will ultra-high permeance membranes lead to ultra-efficient processes?

The calculation results show that the Young's modulus, shear modulus, specific heat capacity, and CTE of armchair and zigzag types of phosphorene sheets decrease with the increasing vacancy defect ratio. The specific heat capacity and linear CTE would rise with increasing temperature at low temperatures and converge to a constant value as temperature is larger than 600 K.

Both enthalpy and volume relaxation kinetics were found to be uninfluenced by Se addition.

Although PFC was originally introduced as a phenomenological model in materials science (Elder et al., 2002), it was later shown that it can be derived from density functional theory (DFT) by certain approximations (Elder et al., 2007) providing a significant predictive capability for PFC. However, these approximations in PFC, similar to any other higher-scale computational model derived from DFT, have introduced intrinsic challenges for quantifying of PFC for specific materials; i. e. determining PFC model parameters for specific materials. The objective of this article is to present a variety of possible approaches that can be used for quantifying PFC for solidification/melting modeling. Thus, we present a reformulation of PFC model containing two extra parameters and four possible quantification approaches. Then, representative material properties corresponding for each individual approach are calculated and compared with their available experimental/computational counterparts in literature. The representative material properties include elastic constants, liquid and solid densities, liquid structure factor, latent heat, and solid-liquid interface free energy and its anisotropy. We discuss the quantitative capabilities of each quantification approach regarding their prediction of the mentioned representative material properties for Fe as an example material. The discussion provided in this study can be used as a guideline to select the proper quantification approach for researchers who need to use PFC for quantitative modeling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

Our work presents a fundamental understanding of the theoretical SFE calculation and the deviations involved in computational thermodynamic approach and first-principles calculations systematically for the first time.

Herein, we demonstrate that these C/W foams may be stabilized with viscoelastic aqueous phases formed with a single zwitterionic surfactant at a concentration of only 1% (w/v) in DI water and over a wide range of salinity. Moreover, they are stable with a foam quality phi up to 0.98 even for temperatures up to 120 degrees C. The properties of aqueous viscoelastic solutions and foams containing these solutions are examined for a series of zwitterionic amidopropylcarbobetaines, R-ONHC3H6N(CH3)(2)CH2CO2, where R is varied from C12-14 (coco) to C-18 (oleyl) to C-22 (erucyl). For the surfactants with long C-18 and C-22 tails, the relaxation times from complex rheology indicate the presence of viscoelastic wormlike micelles over a wide range in salinity and pH, given the high surfactant packing fraction. The apparent viscosities of these ultralow water content foams reached more than 120 cP with stabilities more than 30-fold over those for foams formed with the non-viscoelastic C12-14 surfactant. At 90 degrees C, the foam morphology was composed of similar to 35 mu m diameter bubbles with a polyhedral texture. The apparent foam viscosity typically increased with phi, and then dropped at phi values higher than 0.95-0.98. The Ostwald ripening rate was slower for foams with viscoelastic versus non-viscoelastic lamellae as shown by optical microscopy, as a consequence of slower lamellar drainage rates.

Past research demonstrates that research participants want their results even when the health implications are not known. The experiences of researchers and institutional review boards (IRBs) in studies that have reported personal chemical exposures can provide insights about ethical and practical approaches while also revealing areas of continued uncertainty. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 researchers and nine IRB members from seven personal exposure studies across the United States to investigate their experiences and attitudes about the report-back process. Researchers reported multiple benefits of report back, including increasing retention and recruitment, advancing environmental health literacy, empowering study participants to take actions to reduce exposures, encouraging shifts in government and industry practices, and helping researchers discover sources of exposure through participant consultation. Researchers also reported challenges, including maintaining ongoing contact with participants, adopting protocols for notification of high exposures to chemicals without health guidelines, developing meaningful report-back materials, and resource limitations. IRB members reported concern for potential harm to participants, such as anxiety about personal results and counterproductive behavior changes. In contrast, researchers who have conducted personal report-back in their studies said that participants did not appear overly alarmed and noted that worry can be a positive outcome to motivate action to reduce harmful exposures. While key concerns raised during the early days of report-back have been substantially resolved for scientists with report-back experience, areas of uncertainty remain.

This knowledge is expected to provide deeper insights about the problem to the decision maker, in addition to assisting the optimization process in future design iterations through an expert system.

This claim is secured by the ample evidence of both wide-and deep-rooted alternative concepts on the topic. Didactic transposition is a theory that comes from a reflection on the teaching and learning process in mathematics but has been used in other disciplinary fields. It will be used in this work in order to clear up the main obstacles in the teaching-learning process of geometric optics. We proceed to argue that since Newton's approach to optics, in his Book I of Opticks, is independent of the corpuscular or undulatory nature of light, it is the most suitable for a constructivist learning environment. However, Newton's theory must be subject to a proper didactic transposition to help overcome the referred alternative concepts. Then is described our didactic transposition in order to create knowledge to be taught using a dialogical process between students' previous knowledge, history of optics and the desired outcomes on geometrical optics in an elementary pre-service teacher training course. Finally, we use the scheme-facet structure of knowledge both to analyse and discuss our results as well as to illuminate shortcomings that must be addressed in our next stage of the inquiry.","Author":"","Title":"A Didactic Sequence of Elementary Geometric Optics Informed by History and Philosophy of Science","ReviewID":"3","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"We introduce a set of benchmark corpora of conversational English speech derived from the Switchboard-I and Fisher datasets. Traditional automatic speech recognition (ASR) research requires considerable computational resources and has slow experimental turnaround times. Our goal is to introduce these new datasets to researchers in the ASR and machine learning communities in order to facilitate the development of novel speech recognition techniques on smaller but still acoustically rich, diverse, and hence interesting corpora. We select these corpora to maximize an acoustic quality criterion while limiting the vocabulary size (from 10 words up to 10,000 words), where both \"acoustic quality\" and vocabulary size are adeptly measured via various submodular functions. We also survey numerous submodular functions that could be useful to measure both \"acoustic quality\" and \"corpus complexity\" and offer guidelines on when and why a scientist may wish use to one vs. another. The corpora selection process itself is naturally performed using various state-of-the-art submodular function optimization procedures, including submodular level-set constrained submodular optimization (SCSC/SCSK), difference-of-submodular (DS) optimization, and unconstrained submodular minimization (SFM), all of which are fully defined herein. While the focus of this paper is on the resultant speech corpora, and the survey of possible objectives, a consequence of the paper is a thorough empirical comparison of the relative merits of these modern submodular optimization procedures. We provide baseline word recognition results on all of the resultant speech corpora for both Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and deep neural network (DNN)-based systems, and we have released all of the corpora definitions and Kaldi training recipes for free in the public domain.

The framework proposes a new spatial features-based strategy for band selection to define training label with rich information for the first time. Then, hyperspectral data is trained by deep CNN to build a model with optimized parameters which is suitable for HSI reconstruction. Finally, the reconstructed image is classified by the efficient extreme learning machine (ELM) with a very simple structure. Experimental results indicate that framework built based on CNN and ELM provides competitive performance with small number of training samples. Specifically, by using the reconstructed image, the average accuracy of ELM can be improved as high as 30.04%, while performs tens to hundreds of times faster than those state-of-the-art classifiers.","Author":"","Title":"Hyperspectral image reconstruction by deep convolutional neural network for classification","ReviewID":"6","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"In this study, we develop a novel nonlinear metric learning method to improve biomarker identification for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).

To address this issue, we propose a new method to automatically grade placental maturity from B-mode ultrasound (BUS) and color Doppler energy (CDE) images based on a hybrid learning architecture. We also apply an improved pyramidal shift invariant feature transform (IPSIFT) descriptor using a coarse-to-fine scale representation for visual feature extraction. These local features are then clustered by a generative Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to incorporate high order statistics. Next, the clustering representatives are encoded and aggregated via Fisher vector (FV). Instead of using traditional FV, an end to -end deep training strategy is developed to fine-tune the GMM parameters to boost evaluation performance. A multi-view fusion technique is also developed for feature complementarity exploration.

We performed a controlled fishing experiment targeting northern pike (Esox lucius) in a small (25 ha), weakly eutrophic natural lake situated about 80 km northeast of Berlin (Germany) to understand abiotic, biotic and gear-related factors that relate to catch rates and size of pike captured by angling. The experiment was conducted over two one-week long fishing campaigns where boat-based anglers randomly sampled across 30 pre-determined sites. Sites were systematically exposed to two standardized lure types (soft plastic shad or spoon). We found the catch rates of pike per 15 min to be significantly higher in shallow water and when soft plastic lures were used compared to deeper water and when spoons were used. Catch rates significantly dropped over the course of seven days, suggesting either learning or other reasons moving pike from vulnerable to invulnerable pools (e.g., due to stress caused by capture, sampling and release). Catch rates also varied by season and across anglers and sites as random effects. The variation in size of pike captured exhibited greater stochasticity than variation in catch rate. There was no lure effect on the size of the pike captured, but we found a seasonal effect and a day effect, suggesting larger fish were captured first. Pike captured in sublittoral areas were significantly smaller than those captured in other habitats. Overall, our study documented a novel effect of lure type on the catch rates of pike, but the explanatory power of the predictors was only moderate. Therefore, our results support the idea that the best fishing ingredients are investing time and maximizing encounter probabilities through habitat choice, with only moderate additional effects to be expected from attention to abiotic conditions, day time and choice of type of artificial lure.

Our experiments explore both local and global vocabularies. We investigate the effect of adding small random noise to local tf as the input representation of AE, and propose an ensemble of such noisy AEs which we call the Ensemble Noisy Auto-Encoder (ENAE). ENAE is a stochastic version of an AE that adds noise to the input text and selects the top sentences from an ensemble of noisy runs. In each individual experiment of the ensemble, a different randomly generated noise is added to the input representation. This architecture changes the application of the AE from a deterministic feed-forward network to a stochastic runtime model. Experiments show that the AE using local vocabularies clearly provide a more discriminative feature space and improves the recall on average 11.2%. The ENAE can make further improvements, particularly in selecting informative sentences.

To effectively integrate environmental aspects into product innovation processes, companies might have to significantly change some of the practices and habits of all the stakeholders involved and of the organisation. To complement the extensive literature on the (technical) \"hard side of ecodesign\", this article explores the promising \"soft side\", which considers company culture and human factors, by a multiple step literature review associated with a longitudinal action research in a large cosmetics company. Although a consistent prescriptive change model is still lacking in ecodesign literature, a strong convergence and complementarity is observed between the previous conclusions on ecodesign integration models and the emerging Transition Management approach designed for the sustainability issues faced by organisations. As a result, an \"ecodesign transition framework\" is proposed by combining a three-level systemic approach, considering both top-down planning and bottom-up innovation, with new types of interaction and dynamic cycles of action and learning, with a deep stakeholder management. This new framework was developed and positively applied to the company in a five-year experience to face the complex transition process, thus advancing the knowledge from social science for innovation and sustainability management challenges. Such approach could positively address change management issues and help companies evolve toward a more effective sustainable product innovation process, in the context of evolving business management practices that require progressive change and more human-based strategies.

We therefore investigate the effects of variations in the modeling of the parton shower on the performance of deep neural network taggers using jet images from hadronic W bosons at the LHC, including detector-related effects. By investigating network performance on samples from the Pythia, Herwig and Sherpa generators, we find differences of up to 50% in background rejection for fixed signal efficiency. We also introduce and study a method, which we dub zooming, for implementing scale invariance in neural-network-based taggers.

Using a variety of neuroimaging modalities such as structural, functional and diffusion MRI, along with machine learning techniques, hundreds of studies have been carried out for accurate classification of patients with heterogeneous mental and neurodegenerative disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. More than 500 studies have been published during the past quarter century on single subject prediction focused on a multiple brain disorders. In the first part of this study, we provide a survey of more than 200 reports in this field with a focus on schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), depressive disorders, autism spectrum disease (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Detailed information about those studies such as sample size, type and number of extracted features and reported accuracy are summarized and discussed. To our knowledge, this is by far the most comprehensive review of neuroimaging-based single subject prediction of brain disorders. In the second part, we present our opinion on major pitfalls of those studies from a machine learning point of view. Common biases are discussed and suggestions are provided. Moreover, emerging trends such as decentralized data sharing, multimodal brain imaging, differential diagnosis, disease subtype classification and deep learning are also discussed. Based on this survey, there is extensive evidence showing the great potential of neuroimaging data for single subject prediction of various disorders. However, the main bottleneck of this exciting field is still the limited sample size, which could be potentially addressed by modern data sharing models such as the ones discussed in this paper.

However, the structural complexity of most temperate watersheds (i.e. connections among shallow soils, deep aquifers, the atmosphere and streams) and the dynamic seasonal changes that occur within them (i.e., plant senescence which impacts evapotranspiration) create significant challenges to characterizing or quantifying hydrologic connectivity. The McMurdo Dry Valleys, a polar desert in Antarctica, provide a unique opportunity to study hydrologic connectivity because there is no vegetative cover (and therefore no transpiration), and no deep aquifers connected to surface soils or streams. Glacier melt provides stream flow to well-established channels and closed-basin, ice-covered lakes on the valley floor. Streams are also connected to shallow hyporheic zones along their lengths, which are bounded at similar to 75 cm depth by ice-cemented permafrost. These hydrologic features and connections provide water for and underpin biological communities. Hence, exchange of water among them provides a vector for exchange of energy and dissolved solutes. Connectivity is dynamic on timescales of a day to a flow season (6-12 weeks), as streamflow varies over these timescales. The timescales over which these connections occur is also dynamic. Exchanges between streams and hyporheic zones, for example, have been estimated to be as short as hours to as long as several weeks. These exchanges have significant implications for the biogeochemistry of these systems and the biotic communities in each feature. Here we evaluate the lessons we can learn about hydrologic connectivity in the MDV watersheds that are simplified in the context of processes occurring and water reservoirs included in the landscape, yet are sensitive to climate controls and contain substantial physical heterogeneity. We specifically explore several metrics that are simple and/or commonly employed in hydrologic analyses and interpret them in the context of connectivity between and among hydrologic features.

Results showed that ICSS subjects committed fewer errors than Sham subjects and adopted more accurate trajectories during the acquisition of the task. This improvement was maintained until the probe test at 72 h.

In the tide of globalization and information technology, geopolitics has become an important subject for global pattern interpretation and policy making. It is essentially important to have a scientific and systematic review on international geopolitics to promote its development. Based on the bibliometric statistics, the paper reviews the research development of geopolitics on the Web of Science from 1996 to 2015. The history, journals, papers and key research areas of geopolitics have been revealed in the paper. By the analysis of bibliometric statistics, the number of papers recently published in the journals of political geography and related geography journals continues to increase. The key areas of geopolitical papers which are globally highly cited include geopolitical interpretation of the countries and borders, critical geopolitics, emotional geopolitics, feminist geopolitics and other topics. Before the year of 2000, the state and borders were hot topics of the geopolitical research. Yet since 2000, it has been the trend that the geopolitics is increasingly set in the context of geographical implications. At the same time, critical geopolitics appears to be the main area of geopolitical research, especially transitioning from traditional geopolitics towards the humanism-embeddedness (such as emotional geopolitics, feminist geopolitics). The paper then systematically reviews the branch trends of geopolitical research, including the borders and the territory, global geo-culture and geo-economics, Chinese models of geopolitics, resource conflicts and ecological politics, as well as emotional geopolitics. Finally, it puts forward the implication that Chinese geopolitical studies should reinforce the importance of geographical space and scale, use the process of description and multiple methods, as well as integrate humanistic thoughts, in order to further enrich the theories and practices of geopolitical research.","Author":"","Title":"Progress in international geopolitical research from 1996 to 2015","ReviewID":"2","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"We considered a sensor formation problem for target localization based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) data.

Prior studies largely focused on users' early adoption of cloud storage services, continual usage of the services and users' willingness to pay. However, limited attention has been paid to switching behaviors. In the Chinese market, as services provided by different platforms become homogeneous, non-functional factors are expected to play an important role in affecting users' selection of services. Based on the push-pull mooring framework, we propose a research model by incorporating four factors: risk, trust, switching cost and social influences (critical mass and social norm). Results from a field survey suggest that all push (risk), pull (trust, critical mass) and mooring (switching cost, social norm) factors each have direct impacts on switching intention. Mooring factors fail to moderate the impact of push factor on switching intention, but they are able to moderate the effects of pull factors on switching intention.

Moreover, the vast amount of online health information some of it of dubious quality makes the task of finding relevant information difficult. Therefore, this experiment also tested an approach to improving the online health information seeking process by tailoring search engine results about influenza to the emotional action tendencies of users. This study finds varied effects for different post-search discrete emotions (fear, hope, contentment, interest, and inspiration) and explores how social cognitive mediators and perceived relevance shape post-search attitudes and behaviors.

In response to this, the problem of systems' interoperability is revisited by taking into the account the different aspects of philosophy, psychology, linguistics and artificial intelligence, namely by analysing the potential analogies between the processes of human and system communication. Then, the capability to interoperate as a property of the system, is defined as a complex ability to seamlessly sense and perceive a stimulus from its environment (assumingly, a message from any other system), make an informed decision about this perception and consequently, articulate a meaningful and useful action or response, based on this decision. Although this capability is defined on the basis of the existing interoperability theories, the proposed approach to its definition excludes the assumption on the awareness of co-existence of two interoperating systems. Thus, it establishes the links between the research of interoperability of systems and intelligent software agents, as one of the systems' digital identities.","Author":"","Title":"On the formal definition of the systems' interoperability capability: an anthropomorphic approach","ReviewID":"17","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"The effective deployment of enterprise systems has been a major challenge for many organisations. Customising the new system, changing business processes, and integrating multiple information sources are all difficult tasks. As such, they are typically done in carefully planned stages in a process known as phased implementation. Using ideas from Option Theory, this article critiques aspects of phased implementation. One customer relationship management (CRM) project and its phased implementation are described in detail and ten other enterprise system deployments are summarised as a basis for the observation that almost all deployment stages are pre-defined operational steps rather than decision points. However, Option Theory suggests that optional stages, to be used only when risk materialises, should be integral parts of project plans. Although such optional stages are often more valuable than pre-defined stages, the evidence presented in this article shows that they are only rarely utilised. Therefore, a simple framework is presented; it first identifies risks related to the deployment of enterprise systems, then identifies optional stages that can mitigate these risks, and finally compares the costs and benefits of both pre-defined and optional stages.","Author":"","Title":"Pre-defined and optional staging for the deployment of enterprise systems: a case study and a framework","ReviewID":"18","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Previous research demonstrated that mere instructions to approach one stimulus and avoid another stimulus result in an implicit preference for the to-be-approached over the to-be-avoided stimulus. To investigate the mechanisms underlying approach-avoidance (AA) instruction effects, we tested predictions of a propositional account and an associative self-anchoring account in a preregistered adversarial collaboration. Consistent with the propositional account, Experiment 1 showed that avoidance instructions had a negative effect on implicit evaluations over and above the positive effect of approach instructions. Consistent with the associative self-anchoring account, Experiment 2 showed that changes in implicit self-stimulus linking mediated AA instruction effects on implicit evaluations. However, mediation was only partial, in that AA instructions showed a significant effect on implicit evaluations after controlling for implicit self-stimulus linking. Together, the results support the contribution of propositional processes to AA instruction effects; the results remain ambiguous regarding an additional contribution of associative self-anchoring.

Online disclosure consciousness (ODC) is introduced as a framework to conceptualize, explain the study's findings, and empirically measure the gap between one's willingness to disclose and perceived risk pertaining to the overall 17-item index used in the study, the sub-indices, and particular items. The results show significant gaps among participants both within and across nations.

These psychological factors are modelled through the lens of Upper Echelon Theory (UET) to study their interrelationship and interdependency and further prioritize them to strategize appropriate managerial actions. The factors were identified through an exhaustive literature review and further confirmed by the experts in the field. A hybrid Interpretive Structural Modelling Analytic Network Process (ISM-ANP) approach has been adopted to establish the complex interrelationship among the psychological drivers and further to cluster and prioritize them. The main contribution of this study is composing directions and dominance of various psychological drivers to enhance decision-making process of managers towards the adoption of Green IT/IS. As long as decisions are made by individuals within organizations, this paper forms the basis of identifying individual-level factors important in motivating managers towards Green IT/IS adoption. The results of this study would help organizations and policy makers to understand and develop strategies to target and select an individual for managerial position with mind-set more towards environmental sustainability and Green IT/IS concepts. By applying the proposed methodology, organizations can classify and prioritize their action plans such as several educational methods to reinforce, foster and incline psychological factors to motivate their individuals to behave proenvironmentally and practice Green IT/IS initiatives to enhance environmental sustainability of their corporations.

In the tide of globalization and information technology, geopolitics has become an important subject for global pattern interpretation and policy making. It is essentially important to have a scientific and systematic review on international geopolitics to promote its development. Based on the bibliometric statistics, the paper reviews the research development of geopolitics on the Web of Science from 1996 to 2015. The history, journals, papers and key research areas of geopolitics have been revealed in the paper. By the analysis of bibliometric statistics, the number of papers recently published in the journals of political geography and related geography journals continues to increase. The key areas of geopolitical papers which are globally highly cited include geopolitical interpretation of the countries and borders, critical geopolitics, emotional geopolitics, feminist geopolitics and other topics. Before the year of 2000, the state and borders were hot topics of the geopolitical research. Yet since 2000, it has been the trend that the geopolitics is increasingly set in the context of geographical implications. At the same time, critical geopolitics appears to be the main area of geopolitical research, especially transitioning from traditional geopolitics towards the humanism-embeddedness (such as emotional geopolitics, feminist geopolitics). The paper then systematically reviews the branch trends of geopolitical research, including the borders and the territory, global geo-culture and geo-economics, Chinese models of geopolitics, resource conflicts and ecological politics, as well as emotional geopolitics. Finally, it puts forward the implication that Chinese geopolitical studies should reinforce the importance of geographical space and scale, use the process of description and multiple methods, as well as integrate humanistic thoughts, in order to further enrich the theories and practices of geopolitical research.","Author":"","Title":"Progress in international geopolitical research from 1996 to 2015","ReviewID":"2","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"We considered a sensor formation problem for target localization based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) data.

Online social networks are perceived to provide individuals new benefits and have led to a surge Of personal data uploaded, stored, and shared. While privacy concerns are a major issue for many users of social networking sites, studies have shown that their information disclosing behavior does not align with their concerns. This gap between behavior and concern is called the privacy paradox. Several theories have been explored to explain this, but with inconsistent and incomplete results. This study investigates the paradox using a construal level theory lens. We show how a privacy breach, not yet experienced and psychologically distant, has less weight in everyday choices than more concrete and psychologically-near social networking activities and discuss the implications for research and practice.

Prior studies largely focused on users' early adoption of cloud storage services, continual usage of the services and users' willingness to pay. However, limited attention has been paid to switching behaviors. In the Chinese market, as services provided by different platforms become homogeneous, non-functional factors are expected to play an important role in affecting users' selection of services. Based on the push-pull mooring framework, we propose a research model by incorporating four factors: risk, trust, switching cost and social influences (critical mass and social norm). Results from a field survey suggest that all push (risk), pull (trust, critical mass) and mooring (switching cost, social norm) factors each have direct impacts on switching intention. Mooring factors fail to moderate the impact of push factor on switching intention, but they are able to moderate the effects of pull factors on switching intention. The results yield both theoretical and practical implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To accomplish their goals, these organizations strive to appear credible to target audiences. Metzger, Flanagin, and Medders' (2010) theory of online credibility assessment explains that Internet users rely on peripheral cues to determine whether website information is credible or not. We conducted two studies to test this theory in an online ideological environment. In addition, we investigated how website viewers' pre-existing attitudes regarding the ideological topic affects how they perceive the messages presented on these websites. Results of this research found that this theory partially extends to ideological settings. However, participants did not attribute credibility to ideological topics on a uniform basis. Participants' pre-existing attitudes regarding the topic and the position advocated for by the website sponsor played a critical role in what type of credibility cues were most salient.

However, scholarship has yet to carefully examine how online health information seelcing contributes to post-search health behaviors, including the sharing of information found during the search with others. Combining insights from the appraisal theory of emotions and social cognitive theory, this study used a naturalistic experiment (N = 380) to test a model of the role of post-search emotions in shaping post search cognitions and behavior in the context of influenza. Moreover, the vast amount of online health information some of it of dubious quality makes the task of finding relevant information difficult. Therefore, this experiment also tested an approach to improving the online health information seeking process by tailoring search engine results about influenza to the emotional action tendencies of users. This study finds varied effects for different post-search discrete emotions (fear, hope, contentment, interest, and inspiration) and explores how social cognitive mediators and perceived relevance shape post-search attitudes and behaviors. The results underscore the importance of studying discrete emotional reactions to online health information in order to better predict the attitudinal and behavioral outcomes of this popular avenue for acquiring health information.

In response to this, the problem of systems' interoperability is revisited by taking into the account the different aspects of philosophy, psychology, linguistics and artificial intelligence, namely by analysing the potential analogies between the processes of human and system communication. Then, the capability to interoperate as a property of the system, is defined as a complex ability to seamlessly sense and perceive a stimulus from its environment (assumingly, a message from any other system), make an informed decision about this perception and consequently, articulate a meaningful and useful action or response, based on this decision. Although this capability is defined on the basis of the existing interoperability theories, the proposed approach to its definition excludes the assumption on the awareness of co-existence of two interoperating systems. Thus, it establishes the links between the research of interoperability of systems and intelligent software agents, as one of the systems' digital identities.","Author":"","Title":"On the formal definition of the systems' interoperability capability: an anthropomorphic approach","ReviewID":"17","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"The effective deployment of enterprise systems has been a major challenge for many organisations. Customising the new system, changing business processes, and integrating multiple information sources are all difficult tasks. As such, they are typically done in carefully planned stages in a process known as phased implementation. Using ideas from Option Theory, this article critiques aspects of phased implementation. One customer relationship management (CRM) project and its phased implementation are described in detail and ten other enterprise system deployments are summarised as a basis for the observation that almost all deployment stages are pre-defined operational steps rather than decision points. However, Option Theory suggests that optional stages, to be used only when risk materialises, should be integral parts of project plans. Although such optional stages are often more valuable than pre-defined stages, the evidence presented in this article shows that they are only rarely utilised. Therefore, a simple framework is presented; it first identifies risks related to the deployment of enterprise systems, then identifies optional stages that can mitigate these risks, and finally compares the costs and benefits of both pre-defined and optional stages.","Author":"","Title":"Pre-defined and optional staging for the deployment of enterprise systems: a case study and a framework","ReviewID":"18","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Previous research demonstrated that mere instructions to approach one stimulus and avoid another stimulus result in an implicit preference for the to-be-approached over the to-be-avoided stimulus. To investigate the mechanisms underlying approach-avoidance (AA) instruction effects, we tested predictions of a propositional account and an associative self-anchoring account in a preregistered adversarial collaboration. Consistent with the propositional account, Experiment 1 showed that avoidance instructions had a negative effect on implicit evaluations over and above the positive effect of approach instructions. Consistent with the associative self-anchoring account, Experiment 2 showed that changes in implicit self-stimulus linking mediated AA instruction effects on implicit evaluations. However, mediation was only partial, in that AA instructions showed a significant effect on implicit evaluations after controlling for implicit self-stimulus linking. Together, the results support the contribution of propositional processes to AA instruction effects; the results remain ambiguous regarding an additional contribution of associative self-anchoring.

Remember responses involve eyewitness identification of the target person as an episodic memory task, because it implies retrieving information about the target person in the place and at the time of the event. Know responses, in contrast, engage recognition based on familiarity or perceptual facilitation, that is, as a semantic memory task. To explore the relation between retrieval experiences and recognition accuracy, 86 participants took part in a recognition task with two conditions: one with an interpolated target absent line-up and the other only with the target present line-up. Accuracy of recognition and retrieval experience was measured. The results showed that, having previously participated in a target-absent line-up, increased omissions, while the number of hits decreased. Furthermore, participants' know responses were associated to false recognition, whilst remember responses were associated to hits in recognition. Thus, asking eyewitnesses to inform about the kind of retrieval experience in which they based their recognition responses, may serve as a reliable indicator of accuracy in recognition.

This paper seeks to outline why there is a need to develop a UK-specific version of this well-known and very popular free service, and what practical approaches have taken towards bringing a Beta service live for all to use and feedback on. Design/methodology/approach - The approach to development of UKPMC has been consultative and iterative. Through surveys, focus groups and one-to-one user tests the aim has been to develop a service which can fit neatly into a researcher's workflow. Coordinating the programme itself has required close collaboration between organisations which are quite diverse both culturally and administratively. Findings - Through developing UKPMC, technology has been melded together with practical delivery. The text mining functionality that the service now offers is truly innovative, and there is further potential to develop this. The recently launched Beta service (beta.ukpmc.ac.uk) will continue to be honed particularly its text mining functionality through ongoing user consultation and feedback. It is perceived that this flexible approach to development is essential in offering a service that is truly useful for the UK's life sciences research community and offers a compelling reason to use it as a valid and ground breaking alternative to Pub Med Central (the US version).

Many of these reports relate to breakthroughs in materials science, including fabrication of new 2-D materials such as graphene oxide, and structured materials such as metal organic frameworks. Interestingly, the ultra-high permeances described are invariably measured for flat sheet membranes, in highly dilute systems. The effects of pressure gradients across the membrane, and the effects of concentration polarisation at significant, real world concentrations are not usually considered. In practise, membrane modules, rather than flat membrane sheets, are used in industrial processes. In concentrated systems, employing modules, concentration polarisation and module pressure drops will also affect overall process performance. This work examines the extent to which increasing membrane permeance can impact on processes employing membrane modules, considering both spiral-wound and hollow fibre configurations. Our key conclusion is that ultra-high permeance membranes will not be able to make a significant impact on process efficiency with current module designs; and our recommendation is that fresh research into module and process design is required.","Author":"","Title":"Will ultra-high permeance membranes lead to ultra-efficient processes?

The study aims at providing a systematic investigation of the effect of atomistic defect on thermal-mechanical properties, such as Young's modulus, shear modulus, specific heat capacity, and linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), of phosphorene sheets using molecular dynamics simulation incorporated with Nos,-Hoover Langevin thermostat. The calculation results show that the Young's modulus, shear modulus, specific heat capacity, and CTE of armchair and zigzag types of phosphorene sheets decrease with the increasing vacancy defect ratio. The specific heat capacity and linear CTE would rise with increasing temperature at low temperatures and converge to a constant value as temperature is larger than 600 K.

Both enthalpy and volume relaxation kinetics were found to be uninfluenced by Se addition. On the other hand, DSC crystallization behavior changed significantly with increasing Se content: initial addition of Se partially delays and decelerates both the initial Te precipitation and the consequent volume-located crystallization of GeTe and Te; additional increase of Se content then further delays and separates the volume-located crystallization processes but the initial surface Te precipitation is no longer affected. From this point of view the fine compositional tuning of basic thermal stability of Ge-Te-Se infrared glasses appears meaningless.

Although PFC was originally introduced as a phenomenological model in materials science (Elder et al., 2002), it was later shown that it can be derived from density functional theory (DFT) by certain approximations (Elder et al., 2007) providing a significant predictive capability for PFC. However, these approximations in PFC, similar to any other higher-scale computational model derived from DFT, have introduced intrinsic challenges for quantifying of PFC for specific materials; i. e. determining PFC model parameters for specific materials. The objective of this article is to present a variety of possible approaches that can be used for quantifying PFC for solidification/melting modeling. Thus, we present a reformulation of PFC model containing two extra parameters and four possible quantification approaches. Then, representative material properties corresponding for each individual approach are calculated and compared with their available experimental/computational counterparts in literature. The representative material properties include elastic constants, liquid and solid densities, liquid structure factor, latent heat, and solid-liquid interface free energy and its anisotropy. We discuss the quantitative capabilities of each quantification approach regarding their prediction of the mentioned representative material properties for Fe as an example material. The discussion provided in this study can be used as a guideline to select the proper quantification approach for researchers who need to use PFC for quantitative modeling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

Our work presents a fundamental understanding of the theoretical SFE calculation and the deviations involved in computational thermodynamic approach and first-principles calculations systematically for the first time. It concludes that the SFEs of binary Co-based alloys are increased as the increased of temperature, Ni, Mn, Al and Fe concentrations while the SFEs are decreased as the increased of Cr, W and Mo concentrations qualitatively. Quantitatively, the SFE differences of these two methods are relatively small (lower than 27 mJ/m(2)). The SFE variations can be explained regarding the charge density distributions and the atomic bonding.

Herein, we demonstrate that these C/W foams may be stabilized with viscoelastic aqueous phases formed with a single zwitterionic surfactant at a concentration of only 1% (w/v) in DI water and over a wide range of salinity. Moreover, they are stable with a foam quality phi up to 0.98 even for temperatures up to 120 degrees C. The properties of aqueous viscoelastic solutions and foams containing these solutions are examined for a series of zwitterionic amidopropylcarbobetaines, R-ONHC3H6N(CH3)(2)CH2CO2, where R is varied from C12-14 (coco) to C-18 (oleyl) to C-22 (erucyl). For the surfactants with long C-18 and C-22 tails, the relaxation times from complex rheology indicate the presence of viscoelastic wormlike micelles over a wide range in salinity and pH, given the high surfactant packing fraction. The apparent viscosities of these ultralow water content foams reached more than 120 cP with stabilities more than 30-fold over those for foams formed with the non-viscoelastic C12-14 surfactant. At 90 degrees C, the foam morphology was composed of similar to 35 mu m diameter bubbles with a polyhedral texture. The apparent foam viscosity typically increased with phi, and then dropped at phi values higher than 0.95-0.98. The Ostwald ripening rate was slower for foams with viscoelastic versus non-viscoelastic lamellae as shown by optical microscopy, as a consequence of slower lamellar drainage rates. The ability to achieve high stabilities for ultralow water content C/W foams over a wide temperature range is of interest in various technologies including polymer and materials science, CO2 enhanced oil recovery, CO2 sequestration (by greater control of the CO2 flow patterns), and possibly even hydraulic fracturing with minimal use of water to reduce the requirements for wastewater disposal.

Past research demonstrates that research participants want their results even when the health implications are not known. The experiences of researchers and institutional review boards (IRBs) in studies that have reported personal chemical exposures can provide insights about ethical and practical approaches while also revealing areas of continued uncertainty. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 researchers and nine IRB members from seven personal exposure studies across the United States to investigate their experiences and attitudes about the report-back process. Researchers reported multiple benefits of report back, including increasing retention and recruitment, advancing environmental health literacy, empowering study participants to take actions to reduce exposures, encouraging shifts in government and industry practices, and helping researchers discover sources of exposure through participant consultation. Researchers also reported challenges, including maintaining ongoing contact with participants, adopting protocols for notification of high exposures to chemicals without health guidelines, developing meaningful report-back materials, and resource limitations. IRB members reported concern for potential harm to participants, such as anxiety about personal results and counterproductive behavior changes. In contrast, researchers who have conducted personal report-back in their studies said that participants did not appear overly alarmed and noted that worry can be a positive outcome to motivate action to reduce harmful exposures. While key concerns raised during the early days of report-back have been substantially resolved for scientists with report-back experience, areas of uncertainty remain. These include ethical tensions surrounding the responsibility of researchers to leverage study results and resources to assist participants in policy or community-level actions to reduce chemical exposures, and how to navigate report-back to vulnerable populations.","Author":"","Title":"Researcher and institutional review board perspectives on the benefits and challenges of reporting back biomonitoring and environmental exposure results","ReviewID":"18","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"The art and science of folding intricate three-dimensional structures out of paper has occupied artists, designers, engineers, and mathematicians for decades, culminating in the design of deployable structures and mechanical metamaterials.

This knowledge is expected to provide deeper insights about the problem to the decision maker, in addition to assisting the optimization process in future design iterations through an expert system.

We performed a controlled fishing experiment targeting northern pike (Esox lucius) in a small (25 ha), weakly eutrophic natural lake situated about 80 km northeast of Berlin (Germany) to understand abiotic, biotic and gear-related factors that relate to catch rates and size of pike captured by angling. The experiment was conducted over two one-week long fishing campaigns where boat-based anglers randomly sampled across 30 pre-determined sites. Sites were systematically exposed to two standardized lure types (soft plastic shad or spoon). We found the catch rates of pike per 15 min to be significantly higher in shallow water and when soft plastic lures were used compared to deeper water and when spoons were used. Catch rates significantly dropped over the course of seven days, suggesting either learning or other reasons moving pike from vulnerable to invulnerable pools (e.g., due to stress caused by capture, sampling and release). Catch rates also varied by season and across anglers and sites as random effects. The variation in size of pike captured exhibited greater stochasticity than variation in catch rate. There was no lure effect on the size of the pike captured, but we found a seasonal effect and a day effect, suggesting larger fish were captured first. Pike captured in sublittoral areas were significantly smaller than those captured in other habitats. Overall, our study documented a novel effect of lure type on the catch rates of pike, but the explanatory power of the predictors was only moderate. Therefore, our results support the idea that the best fishing ingredients are investing time and maximizing encounter probabilities through habitat choice, with only moderate additional effects to be expected from attention to abiotic conditions, day time and choice of type of artificial lure.

Several studies have shown that students find it difficult to understand simple familiar or academic static equilibrium cases as well as dynamic ones from mechanics even if they know the discipline's criteria and formulae. Our aim is to study the impact of a specific and innovative classroom session, containing well-chosen situations that address students' misconceptions. We propose an example of Active Learning experiment based both on the Didactical Engineering methodology and the Conceptual Fields Theory that aims at promoting a conceptual change in students. The chosen methodology allows, at the same time, a proper design of the student learning activities, an accurate monitoring of the students' rational use during the tasks and provides an internal tool for the evaluation of the session's efficiency.

Methods: To explore the foundational knowledge and research hotspots of big data research in the field of healthcare informatics, this study conducted a series of bibliometric analyses on the related literature, including papers' production trends in the field and the trend of each paper's co-author number, the distribution of core institutions and countries, the core literature distribution, the related information of prolific authors and innovation paths in the field, a keyword co-occurrence analysis, and research hotspots and trends for the future. Results: By conducting a literature content analysis and structure analysis, we found the following: (a) In the early stage, researchers from the United States, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and Germany made the most contributions to the literature associated with healthcare big data research and the innovation path in this field. (b) The innovation path in healthcare big data consists of three stages: the disease early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis phase, the life and health promotion phase, and the nursing phase. (c) Research hotspots are mainly concentrated in three dimensions: the disease dimension (e.g., epidemiology, breast cancer, obesity, and diabetes), the technical dimension (e.g., data mining and machine learning), and the health service dimension (e.g., customized service and elderly nursing).

Our experiments explore both local and global vocabularies. We investigate the effect of adding small random noise to local tf as the input representation of AE, and propose an ensemble of such noisy AEs which we call the Ensemble Noisy Auto-Encoder (ENAE). ENAE is a stochastic version of an AE that adds noise to the input text and selects the top sentences from an ensemble of noisy runs. In each individual experiment of the ensemble, a different randomly generated noise is added to the input representation. This architecture changes the application of the AE from a deterministic feed-forward network to a stochastic runtime model. Experiments show that the AE using local vocabularies clearly provide a more discriminative feature space and improves the recall on average 11.2%. The ENAE can make further improvements, particularly in selecting informative sentences. To cover a wide range of topics and structures, we perform experiments on two different publicly available email corpora that are specifically designed for text summarization.

To effectively integrate environmental aspects into product innovation processes, companies might have to significantly change some of the practices and habits of all the stakeholders involved and of the organisation. To complement the extensive literature on the (technical) \"hard side of ecodesign\", this article explores the promising \"soft side\", which considers company culture and human factors, by a multiple step literature review associated with a longitudinal action research in a large cosmetics company. Although a consistent prescriptive change model is still lacking in ecodesign literature, a strong convergence and complementarity is observed between the previous conclusions on ecodesign integration models and the emerging Transition Management approach designed for the sustainability issues faced by organisations. As a result, an \"ecodesign transition framework\" is proposed by combining a three-level systemic approach, considering both top-down planning and bottom-up innovation, with new types of interaction and dynamic cycles of action and learning, with a deep stakeholder management. This new framework was developed and positively applied to the company in a five-year experience to face the complex transition process, thus advancing the knowledge from social science for innovation and sustainability management challenges. Such approach could positively address change management issues and help companies evolve toward a more effective sustainable product innovation process, in the context of evolving business management practices that require progressive change and more human-based strategies.

These methods require training on a data set produced by an event generator where the true class labels are known. However, this may bias the network towards learning features associated with the approximations to QCD used in that generator which are not present in real data. We therefore investigate the effects of variations in the modeling of the parton shower on the performance of deep neural network taggers using jet images from hadronic W bosons at the LHC, including detector-related effects. By investigating network performance on samples from the Pythia, Herwig and Sherpa generators, we find differences of up to 50% in background rejection for fixed signal efficiency. We also introduce and study a method, which we dub zooming, for implementing scale invariance in neural-network-based taggers. We find that this leads to an improvement in performance across a wide range of jet transverse momenta.

Using a variety of neuroimaging modalities such as structural, functional and diffusion MRI, along with machine learning techniques, hundreds of studies have been carried out for accurate classification of patients with heterogeneous mental and neurodegenerative disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. More than 500 studies have been published during the past quarter century on single subject prediction focused on a multiple brain disorders. In the first part of this study, we provide a survey of more than 200 reports in this field with a focus on schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), depressive disorders, autism spectrum disease (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Detailed information about those studies such as sample size, type and number of extracted features and reported accuracy are summarized and discussed. To our knowledge, this is by far the most comprehensive review of neuroimaging-based single subject prediction of brain disorders. In the second part, we present our opinion on major pitfalls of those studies from a machine learning point of view. Common biases are discussed and suggestions are provided. Moreover, emerging trends such as decentralized data sharing, multimodal brain imaging, differential diagnosis, disease subtype classification and deep learning are also discussed. Based on this survey, there is extensive evidence showing the great potential of neuroimaging data for single subject prediction of various disorders. However, the main bottleneck of this exciting field is still the limited sample size, which could be potentially addressed by modern data sharing models such as the ones discussed in this paper. Emerging big data technologies and advanced data-intensive machine learning methodologies such as deep learning have coincided with an increasing need for accurate, robust and generalizable single subject prediction of brain disorders during an exciting time.

However, the structural complexity of most temperate watersheds (i.e. connections among shallow soils, deep aquifers, the atmosphere and streams) and the dynamic seasonal changes that occur within them (i.e., plant senescence which impacts evapotranspiration) create significant challenges to characterizing or quantifying hydrologic connectivity. The McMurdo Dry Valleys, a polar desert in Antarctica, provide a unique opportunity to study hydrologic connectivity because there is no vegetative cover (and therefore no transpiration), and no deep aquifers connected to surface soils or streams. Glacier melt provides stream flow to well-established channels and closed-basin, ice-covered lakes on the valley floor. Streams are also connected to shallow hyporheic zones along their lengths, which are bounded at similar to 75 cm depth by ice-cemented permafrost. These hydrologic features and connections provide water for and underpin biological communities. Hence, exchange of water among them provides a vector for exchange of energy and dissolved solutes. Connectivity is dynamic on timescales of a day to a flow season (6-12 weeks), as streamflow varies over these timescales. The timescales over which these connections occur is also dynamic. Exchanges between streams and hyporheic zones, for example, have been estimated to be as short as hours to as long as several weeks. These exchanges have significant implications for the biogeochemistry of these systems and the biotic communities in each feature. Here we evaluate the lessons we can learn about hydrologic connectivity in the MDV watersheds that are simplified in the context of processes occurring and water reservoirs included in the landscape, yet are sensitive to climate controls and contain substantial physical heterogeneity. We specifically explore several metrics that are simple and/or commonly employed in hydrologic analyses and interpret them in the context of connectivity between and among hydrologic features.

However, the evidence supporting this effect on implicit memory comes mainly from classical conditioning and avoidance tasks. The present work aims to determine whether ICSS would also improve the performance of rats in another type of implicit task such as cued simultaneous visual discrimination in the Morris Water Maze. The ICSS treatment was administered immediately after each of the five acquisition sessions and its effects on retention and reversal were evaluated 72 h later. Results showed that ICSS subjects committed fewer errors than Sham subjects and adopted more accurate trajectories during the acquisition of the task. This improvement was maintained until the probe test at 72 h. However, ICSS animals experienced more difficulties than the Sham group during the reversal of the same learning, reflecting an impairment in cognitive flexibility. We conclude that post-training ICSS could also be an effective treatment for improving implicit visual discrimination learning and memory. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Current computational models of object recognition, including recent deep-learning networks, generate these properties through a hierarchy of alternating selectivity-increasing filtering and tolerance-increasing pooling operations, similar to simple-complex cells operations [3-6]. Here, we prove that a class of hierarchical architectures and a broad set of biologically plausible learning rules generate approximate invariance to identity-preserving transformations at the top level of the processing hierarchy. However, all past models tested failed to reproduce the most salient property of an intermediate representation of a three-level face-processing hierarchy in the brain: mirror-symmetric tuning to head orientation [7]. Here, we demonstrate that one specific biologically plausible Hebb-type learning rule generates mirror-symmetric tuning to bilaterally symmetric stimuli, like faces, at intermediate levels of the architecture and show why it does so. Thus, the tuning properties of individual cells inside the visual stream appear to result from group properties of the stimuli they encode and to reflect the learning rules that sculpted the information-processing system within which they reside.","Author":"","Title":"View-Tolerant Face Recognition and Hebbian Learning Imply Mirror-Symmetric Neural Tuning to Head Orientation","ReviewID":"29","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"This study examines how demographic variables affect willingness to disclose and perceived risks of disclosing personally identifying information (PII, also referred to as personal data in Europe) in ecommerce in the United States and Estonia.

In the tide of globalization and information technology, geopolitics has become an important subject for global pattern interpretation and policy making. It is essentially important to have a scientific and systematic review on international geopolitics to promote its development. Based on the bibliometric statistics, the paper reviews the research development of geopolitics on the Web of Science from 1996 to 2015. The history, journals, papers and key research areas of geopolitics have been revealed in the paper. By the analysis of bibliometric statistics, the number of papers recently published in the journals of political geography and related geography journals continues to increase. The key areas of geopolitical papers which are globally highly cited include geopolitical interpretation of the countries and borders, critical geopolitics, emotional geopolitics, feminist geopolitics and other topics. Before the year of 2000, the state and borders were hot topics of the geopolitical research. Yet since 2000, it has been the trend that the geopolitics is increasingly set in the context of geographical implications. At the same time, critical geopolitics appears to be the main area of geopolitical research, especially transitioning from traditional geopolitics towards the humanism-embeddedness (such as emotional geopolitics, feminist geopolitics). The paper then systematically reviews the branch trends of geopolitical research, including the borders and the territory, global geo-culture and geo-economics, Chinese models of geopolitics, resource conflicts and ecological politics, as well as emotional geopolitics. Finally, it puts forward the implication that Chinese geopolitical studies should reinforce the importance of geographical space and scale, use the process of description and multiple methods, as well as integrate humanistic thoughts, in order to further enrich the theories and practices of geopolitical research.","Author":"","Title":"Progress in international geopolitical research from 1996 to 2015","ReviewID":"2","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"We considered a sensor formation problem for target localization based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) data.

The study utilized a 17 item list of potential disclosure items (name, email address, etc.), categorized reliably into six sub-indices: contact information, payment information, life history information, financial/medical information, work-related information, and online account information. Online disclosure consciousness (ODC) is introduced as a framework to conceptualize, explain the study's findings, and empirically measure the gap between one's willingness to disclose and perceived risk pertaining to the overall 17-item index used in the study, the sub-indices, and particular items. The results show significant gaps among participants both within and across nations. Despite Estonia's advanced adoption and progressive policies and practices toward the Internet, Americans are more willing to disclose, and less concerned about perceived risks. The findings suggest willingness to disclose and risk aversion can and should be analyzed empirically together.

These psychological factors are modelled through the lens of Upper Echelon Theory (UET) to study their interrelationship and interdependency and further prioritize them to strategize appropriate managerial actions. The factors were identified through an exhaustive literature review and further confirmed by the experts in the field. A hybrid Interpretive Structural Modelling Analytic Network Process (ISM-ANP) approach has been adopted to establish the complex interrelationship among the psychological drivers and further to cluster and prioritize them. The main contribution of this study is composing directions and dominance of various psychological drivers to enhance decision-making process of managers towards the adoption of Green IT/IS. As long as decisions are made by individuals within organizations, this paper forms the basis of identifying individual-level factors important in motivating managers towards Green IT/IS adoption. The results of this study would help organizations and policy makers to understand and develop strategies to target and select an individual for managerial position with mind-set more towards environmental sustainability and Green IT/IS concepts. By applying the proposed methodology, organizations can classify and prioritize their action plans such as several educational methods to reinforce, foster and incline psychological factors to motivate their individuals to behave proenvironmentally and practice Green IT/IS initiatives to enhance environmental sustainability of their corporations.

In the tide of globalization and information technology, geopolitics has become an important subject for global pattern interpretation and policy making. It is essentially important to have a scientific and systematic review on international geopolitics to promote its development. Based on the bibliometric statistics, the paper reviews the research development of geopolitics on the Web of Science from 1996 to 2015. The history, journals, papers and key research areas of geopolitics have been revealed in the paper. By the analysis of bibliometric statistics, the number of papers recently published in the journals of political geography and related geography journals continues to increase. The key areas of geopolitical papers which are globally highly cited include geopolitical interpretation of the countries and borders, critical geopolitics, emotional geopolitics, feminist geopolitics and other topics. Before the year of 2000, the state and borders were hot topics of the geopolitical research. Yet since 2000, it has been the trend that the geopolitics is increasingly set in the context of geographical implications. At the same time, critical geopolitics appears to be the main area of geopolitical research, especially transitioning from traditional geopolitics towards the humanism-embeddedness (such as emotional geopolitics, feminist geopolitics). The paper then systematically reviews the branch trends of geopolitical research, including the borders and the territory, global geo-culture and geo-economics, Chinese models of geopolitics, resource conflicts and ecological politics, as well as emotional geopolitics. Finally, it puts forward the implication that Chinese geopolitical studies should reinforce the importance of geographical space and scale, use the process of description and multiple methods, as well as integrate humanistic thoughts, in order to further enrich the theories and practices of geopolitical research.","Author":"","Title":"Progress in international geopolitical research from 1996 to 2015","ReviewID":"2","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"We considered a sensor formation problem for target localization based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) data.

This paper reports the results of a mixed method study in a hotel that offers three contributions to the development and refinement of IT-enabled service personalization theory. It explores the role of signifiers in the design of customer service systems, showing that they significantly increase customer preference elicitation during the learning phase of the service personalization process. It then demonstrates that improved preference elicitation translates into higher customer service evaluations and value perceptions of the hotel. Finally, our study shows that IT-enabled service personalization creates financial benefits for the hotel via revenue share-shift from costly intermediated to direct distribution channels.

However in reality the infusion rate usually varies with respect to time, due to the natural (temporal or random) fluctuation of environments or clinical needs. In this work we study a non-autonomous chemotherapy model where the injection rate and injection concentration of the chemotherapy agent are time-dependent. In particular, we prove that the non-autonomous dynamical system generated by solutions to the non-autonomous chemotherapy system possesses a pullback attractor. In addition, we investigate the detailed interior structures of the pullback attractor to provide crucial information on the effectiveness of the treatment. The main analytical tool used is the theory of non-autonomous dynamical systems. Numerical experiments are carried out to supplement the analysis and illustrate the effectiveness of different types of infusions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

On the basis of potential energy distribution detailed vibrational assignments of observed FT-IR and FT-Raman bands have been proposed. Using molecular electrostatic potential map relative reactivities towards electrophilic and nucleophilic attack are predicted. The first and second hyperpolarizabilities are calculated and the first hyperpolarizability of the title compounds are greater than that of the standard NLO material urea. Molecular studies reveal that the predicted binding affinities of the best poses were -8.7 kcal/mol for BACPC, -9.0 kcal/mol for CBACPC, and -8.8 kcal/mol for the original inhibitor. Efforts were made in order to investigate local reactivity properties of title compounds as well. In order to do so we have calculated average local ionization energy (ALIE) surfaces, Fukui functions, bond dissociation energies (BDE) (within the framework of DFT calculations) and radial distribution functions (RDF) (within the molecular dynamics simulations). ALIE surfaces and Fukui functions gave us initial information on the site reactivity towards electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks.

And gender is considered as the moderating factor in the model. Using 215 valid data from the WeChat users in China, the model is empirically assessed by PLS-SEM. Results show that three types of gratifications positively affect WeChat users' liking behavior: hedonic gratification (enjoyment), social gratification (social support) and utilitarian gratification (information seeking). In particular, enjoyment plays the most important role in determining the liking behavior, followed by social support and information seeking.

Digital piracy is the unauthorized and illegal digital copying or distribution of digital goods, such as music, movies, and software.

Using social cognitive theory, we were able to resolve several contradictions and trade-offs found in the digital piracy literature. Further, our meta-analytic results suggest that four key sets of factors maximize prediction: (1) outcome expectancies (considerations of rewards, perceived risks, and perceived sanctions), (2) social learning (positive and negative social influence and piracy habit), (3) self-efficacy and self-regulation (perceived behavioral control and low self-control), and (4) moral disengagement (morality, immorality, and neutralization).

Remember responses involve eyewitness identification of the target person as an episodic memory task, because it implies retrieving information about the target person in the place and at the time of the event. Know responses, in contrast, engage recognition based on familiarity or perceptual facilitation, that is, as a semantic memory task. To explore the relation between retrieval experiences and recognition accuracy, 86 participants took part in a recognition task with two conditions: one with an interpolated target absent line-up and the other only with the target present line-up. Accuracy of recognition and retrieval experience was measured. The results showed that, having previously participated in a target-absent line-up, increased omissions, while the number of hits decreased. Furthermore, participants' know responses were associated to false recognition, whilst remember responses were associated to hits in recognition. Thus, asking eyewitnesses to inform about the kind of retrieval experience in which they based their recognition responses, may serve as a reliable indicator of accuracy in recognition. Future studies are needed to investigate whether this is also the case in natural settings.","Author":"","Title":"RETRIVAL EXPERIENCE AS AN ACCURATE INDICATOR OF PERSON IDENTIFICATION IN LINE-UPS","ReviewID":"11","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Conference Conference: International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Circuits and Systems (ICIMCS 2011) Location: Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA Date: DEC 12-13, 2011","Author":"","Title":"A HYBRID GA AND ACTIVE LEARNING SVM MODEL FOR RELEVANCE FEEDBACK IN THE CONTENT-BASED IMAGES RETRIVAL","ReviewID":"12","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Conference Conference: 2nd International Conference on Challenges in Environmental Science and Computer Engineering (CESCE) Location: Haikou, PEOPLES R CHINA Date: DEC 14-15, 2011","Author":"","Title":"Multi-level Semantic Characterization and Refinement for Web Image Search","ReviewID":"13","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Conference Conference: IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC) Location: Ningbo, PEOPLES R CHINA Date: SEP 09-11, 2011 Sponsor(s):IEEE; Ningbo Univ; Key Lab Sci & Tech Natl Def (KLSTND)","Author":"","Title":"An information retrieval scheme for Delay and Tolerance Networks","ReviewID":"14","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"As part of a general strategy to integrate the health care enterprise, Austria plans to connect the Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) of all radiological institutions into a nationwide network.

This paper seeks to outline why there is a need to develop a UK-specific version of this well-known and very popular free service, and what practical approaches have taken towards bringing a Beta service live for all to use and feedback on. Design/methodology/approach - The approach to development of UKPMC has been consultative and iterative. Through surveys, focus groups and one-to-one user tests the aim has been to develop a service which can fit neatly into a researcher's workflow. Coordinating the programme itself has required close collaboration between organisations which are quite diverse both culturally and administratively. Findings - Through developing UKPMC, technology has been melded together with practical delivery. The text mining functionality that the service now offers is truly innovative, and there is further potential to develop this. The recently launched Beta service (beta.ukpmc.ac.uk) will continue to be honed particularly its text mining functionality through ongoing user consultation and feedback. It is perceived that this flexible approach to development is essential in offering a service that is truly useful for the UK's life sciences research community and offers a compelling reason to use it as a valid and ground breaking alternative to Pub Med Central (the US version). Originality/value - The originality and value of UKPMC should be judged by the research community.

This particularly interesting application allows the surgeon to consult a centrally-located data base which contains important information regarding similar clinical cases, choice of laserbeam profiles and focal lengths, simulation of beam behaviours, performances and other data. The on-line and direct access to the data base supports him in all those borderline situations in the O.R. in which the laser device type and configuration/calibration play a decive role in the success of the operation. Also, the helmet-mounted display frees surgeon's hands in order to allow him to continue the operation while consulting the data base on-line, thus speeding up decision processes regarding changes of laser set-up, general calibration optimization and remote clinical consultancy.","Author":"","Title":"Proposal of a computerized algorithm for continuous wave CO2 laser on-line control during orthopaedic surgery .2. simplified algorithm version (LCA-s) and helmet-mounted data access device solution","ReviewID":"28","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"The word 'reference process' is used to refer to the entire process of reference transaction.

The latest progress has shown that these 2D materials could have a profound impact on bioelectronics devices.

In particular, the macrostructures of these 2D materials have also been realized by these two processes, which have shown great potentials in the self-supported and special-purpose biosensors.

Many of these reports relate to breakthroughs in materials science, including fabrication of new 2-D materials such as graphene oxide, and structured materials such as metal organic frameworks. Interestingly, the ultra-high permeances described are invariably measured for flat sheet membranes, in highly dilute systems. The effects of pressure gradients across the membrane, and the effects of concentration polarisation at significant, real world concentrations are not usually considered. In practise, membrane modules, rather than flat membrane sheets, are used in industrial processes. In concentrated systems, employing modules, concentration polarisation and module pressure drops will also affect overall process performance. This work examines the extent to which increasing membrane permeance can impact on processes employing membrane modules, considering both spiral-wound and hollow fibre configurations. Our key conclusion is that ultra-high permeance membranes will not be able to make a significant impact on process efficiency with current module designs; and our recommendation is that fresh research into module and process design is required.","Author":"","Title":"Will ultra-high permeance membranes lead to ultra-efficient processes?

Recently, a novel two-dimensional material, i.e., phosphorene sheets with a characteristic puckered structure, has been explored. The study aims at providing a systematic investigation of the effect of atomistic defect on thermal-mechanical properties, such as Young's modulus, shear modulus, specific heat capacity, and linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), of phosphorene sheets using molecular dynamics simulation incorporated with Nos,-Hoover Langevin thermostat. The calculation results show that the Young's modulus, shear modulus, specific heat capacity, and CTE of armchair and zigzag types of phosphorene sheets decrease with the increasing vacancy defect ratio. The specific heat capacity and linear CTE would rise with increasing temperature at low temperatures and converge to a constant value as temperature is larger than 600 K. Besides, the calculated specific heat capacity of the two types of phosphorene sheets all closely follows the Debye T (3)-law at low temperatures.","Author":"","Title":"Influence of structural defect on thermal-mechanical properties of phosphorene sheets","ReviewID":"6","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Hard X-ray transmission microscopy based on refractive X-ray optics can be employed as a tool in material science to investigate buried-in microstructures in two or three dimensions with spatial resolution approaching 100 nm.

Glass transition kinetics was described in terms of the Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan model and the relaxation motions were interpreted using Raman spectroscopy data. Both enthalpy and volume relaxation kinetics were found to be uninfluenced by Se addition. On the other hand, DSC crystallization behavior changed significantly with increasing Se content: initial addition of Se partially delays and decelerates both the initial Te precipitation and the consequent volume-located crystallization of GeTe and Te; additional increase of Se content then further delays and separates the volume-located crystallization processes but the initial surface Te precipitation is no longer affected. From this point of view the fine compositional tuning of basic thermal stability of Ge-Te-Se infrared glasses appears meaningless. On the contrary, glass workability window (determined by means of the TMA crystallization experiments) was found to be significantly affected by Se addition, emphasizing the importance of this type of measurements for the glass technology and material science.

Up to now, there is no consensus about the mechanism behind the so often observed room temperature ferromagnetism. However it is well known that defects plays an important role in the context. Here we present the study of the correlation between the structural and the magnetic properties of nanoparticulate Co-doped ZnO (Zn1-xCoxO, x = 0.02 and 0.08) thin films prepared via Electron Beam-Physical Vapor Deposition. The structural results confirms the incorporation of the Co2+ ions into the ZnO host matrix with no secondary phases. Magnetic measurements show a robust ferromagnetic order for the thin film with x = 0.08, whereas for the sample with x = 0.02 only a tiny ferromagnetism were observed.

Although PFC was originally introduced as a phenomenological model in materials science (Elder et al., 2002), it was later shown that it can be derived from density functional theory (DFT) by certain approximations (Elder et al., 2007) providing a significant predictive capability for PFC. However, these approximations in PFC, similar to any other higher-scale computational model derived from DFT, have introduced intrinsic challenges for quantifying of PFC for specific materials; i. e. determining PFC model parameters for specific materials. The objective of this article is to present a variety of possible approaches that can be used for quantifying PFC for solidification/melting modeling. Thus, we present a reformulation of PFC model containing two extra parameters and four possible quantification approaches. Then, representative material properties corresponding for each individual approach are calculated and compared with their available experimental/computational counterparts in literature. The representative material properties include elastic constants, liquid and solid densities, liquid structure factor, latent heat, and solid-liquid interface free energy and its anisotropy. We discuss the quantitative capabilities of each quantification approach regarding their prediction of the mentioned representative material properties for Fe as an example material. The discussion provided in this study can be used as a guideline to select the proper quantification approach for researchers who need to use PFC for quantitative modeling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

In the present study, we investigate the stacking fault energy (SFE) variations of binary Co-based alloys with different alloying elements (Cr, W, Mo, Ni, Mn, Al and Fe) and concentrations (from 0 to 20 at.%) over a broad range of temperatures (from 0 to 1000 K) by computational thermodynamic approach and first-principles density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations combined with quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). Our work presents a fundamental understanding of the theoretical SFE calculation and the deviations involved in computational thermodynamic approach and first-principles calculations systematically for the first time. It concludes that the SFEs of binary Co-based alloys are increased as the increased of temperature, Ni, Mn, Al and Fe concentrations while the SFEs are decreased as the increased of Cr, W and Mo concentrations qualitatively. Quantitatively, the SFE differences of these two methods are relatively small (lower than 27 mJ/m(2)). The SFE variations can be explained regarding the charge density distributions and the atomic bonding. These results also highlight the critical role of Suzuki effect and the key for the SFE variations is the alloying elements only in the vicinity of the fault plane. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we demonstrate that these C/W foams may be stabilized with viscoelastic aqueous phases formed with a single zwitterionic surfactant at a concentration of only 1% (w/v) in DI water and over a wide range of salinity. Moreover, they are stable with a foam quality phi up to 0.98 even for temperatures up to 120 degrees C. The properties of aqueous viscoelastic solutions and foams containing these solutions are examined for a series of zwitterionic amidopropylcarbobetaines, R-ONHC3H6N(CH3)(2)CH2CO2, where R is varied from C12-14 (coco) to C-18 (oleyl) to C-22 (erucyl). For the surfactants with long C-18 and C-22 tails, the relaxation times from complex rheology indicate the presence of viscoelastic wormlike micelles over a wide range in salinity and pH, given the high surfactant packing fraction. The apparent viscosities of these ultralow water content foams reached more than 120 cP with stabilities more than 30-fold over those for foams formed with the non-viscoelastic C12-14 surfactant. At 90 degrees C, the foam morphology was composed of similar to 35 mu m diameter bubbles with a polyhedral texture. The apparent foam viscosity typically increased with phi, and then dropped at phi values higher than 0.95-0.98. The Ostwald ripening rate was slower for foams with viscoelastic versus non-viscoelastic lamellae as shown by optical microscopy, as a consequence of slower lamellar drainage rates. The ability to achieve high stabilities for ultralow water content C/W foams over a wide temperature range is of interest in various technologies including polymer and materials science, CO2 enhanced oil recovery, CO2 sequestration (by greater control of the CO2 flow patterns), and possibly even hydraulic fracturing with minimal use of water to reduce the requirements for wastewater disposal.

Therefore, control of the electrostatic interaction in order to resulting well-defined nanostructures remains a challenge. Here we report on a general and simple method to moderate the wild electrostatic interaction. Direct mixing of stock solutions containing anionic superparamagnetic nanoparticles and widespread cationic homopolyelectrolytes at an appropriate ionic strength generates aggregates with controlled shape and morphology. The simple and versatile methodology not only efficiently moderates electrostatic interactions but also enables the corresponding growth mechanism to be revealed by light scattering and electron microscopy as aggregation occurs at much slower timescales.

Following the development of laser based terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in the 1980s and 1990s the field of THz science and technology expanded rapidly, to the extent that it now touches many areas from fundamental science to 'real world' applications. For example THz radiation is being used to optimize materials for new solar cells, and may also be a key technology for the next generation of airport security scanners. While the field was emerging it was possible to keep track of all new developments, however now the field has grown so much that it is increasingly difficult to follow the diverse range of new discoveries and applications that are appearing. At this point in time, when the field of THz science and technology is moving from an emerging to a more established and interdisciplinary field, it is apt to present a roadmap to help identify the breadth and future directions of the field. The aim of this roadmap is to present a snapshot of the present state of THz science and technology in 2017, and provide an opinion on the challenges and opportunities that the future holds. To be able to achieve this aim, we have invited a group of international experts to write 18 sections that cover most of the key areas of THz science and technology. We hope that The 2017 Roadmap on THz science and technology will prove to be a useful resource by providing a wide ranging introduction to the capabilities of THz radiation for those outside or just entering the field as well as providing perspective and breadth for those who are well established.

Past research demonstrates that research participants want their results even when the health implications are not known. The experiences of researchers and institutional review boards (IRBs) in studies that have reported personal chemical exposures can provide insights about ethical and practical approaches while also revealing areas of continued uncertainty. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 researchers and nine IRB members from seven personal exposure studies across the United States to investigate their experiences and attitudes about the report-back process. Researchers reported multiple benefits of report back, including increasing retention and recruitment, advancing environmental health literacy, empowering study participants to take actions to reduce exposures, encouraging shifts in government and industry practices, and helping researchers discover sources of exposure through participant consultation. Researchers also reported challenges, including maintaining ongoing contact with participants, adopting protocols for notification of high exposures to chemicals without health guidelines, developing meaningful report-back materials, and resource limitations. IRB members reported concern for potential harm to participants, such as anxiety about personal results and counterproductive behavior changes. In contrast, researchers who have conducted personal report-back in their studies said that participants did not appear overly alarmed and noted that worry can be a positive outcome to motivate action to reduce harmful exposures. While key concerns raised during the early days of report-back have been substantially resolved for scientists with report-back experience, areas of uncertainty remain. These include ethical tensions surrounding the responsibility of researchers to leverage study results and resources to assist participants in policy or community-level actions to reduce chemical exposures, and how to navigate report-back to vulnerable populations.","Author":"","Title":"Researcher and institutional review board perspectives on the benefits and challenges of reporting back biomonitoring and environmental exposure results","ReviewID":"18","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"The art and science of folding intricate three-dimensional structures out of paper has occupied artists, designers, engineers, and mathematicians for decades, culminating in the design of deployable structures and mechanical metamaterials.

While multi-objective optimization itself can be a challenging task, equally difficult is the ability to make sense of the obtained solutions. In this two-part paper, we deal with data mining methods that can be applied to extract knowledge about multi-objective optimization problems from the solutions generated during optimization. This knowledge is expected to provide deeper insights about the problem to the decision maker, in addition to assisting the optimization process in future design iterations through an expert system. The current paper surveys several existing data mining methods and classifies them by methodology and type of knowledge discovered. Most of these methods come from the domain of exploratory data analysis and can be applied to any multivariate data. We specifically look at methods that can generate explicit knowledge in a machine-usable form. A framework for knowledge-driven optimization is proposed, which involves both online and offline elements of knowledge discovery. One of the conclusions of this survey is that while there are a number of data mining methods that can deal with data involving continuous variables, only a few ad hoc methods exist that can provide explicit knowledge when the variables involved are of a discrete nature.

We proceed to argue that since Newton's approach to optics, in his Book I of Opticks, is independent of the corpuscular or undulatory nature of light, it is the most suitable for a constructivist learning environment. However, Newton's theory must be subject to a proper didactic transposition to help overcome the referred alternative concepts.

We select these corpora to maximize an acoustic quality criterion while limiting the vocabulary size (from 10 words up to 10,000 words), where both \"acoustic quality\" and vocabulary size are adeptly measured via various submodular functions. We also survey numerous submodular functions that could be useful to measure both \"acoustic quality\" and \"corpus complexity\" and offer guidelines on when and why a scientist may wish use to one vs. another. The corpora selection process itself is naturally performed using various state-of-the-art submodular function optimization procedures, including submodular level-set constrained submodular optimization (SCSC/SCSK), difference-of-submodular (DS) optimization, and unconstrained submodular minimization (SFM), all of which are fully defined herein.

The experiment was conducted over two one-week long fishing campaigns where boat-based anglers randomly sampled across 30 pre-determined sites. Sites were systematically exposed to two standardized lure types (soft plastic shad or spoon). We found the catch rates of pike per 15 min to be significantly higher in shallow water and when soft plastic lures were used compared to deeper water and when spoons were used. Catch rates significantly dropped over the course of seven days, suggesting either learning or other reasons moving pike from vulnerable to invulnerable pools (e.g., due to stress caused by capture, sampling and release). Catch rates also varied by season and across anglers and sites as random effects. The variation in size of pike captured exhibited greater stochasticity than variation in catch rate. There was no lure effect on the size of the pike captured, but we found a seasonal effect and a day effect, suggesting larger fish were captured first. Pike captured in sublittoral areas were significantly smaller than those captured in other habitats. Overall, our study documented a novel effect of lure type on the catch rates of pike, but the explanatory power of the predictors was only moderate. Therefore, our results support the idea that the best fishing ingredients are investing time and maximizing encounter probabilities through habitat choice, with only moderate additional effects to be expected from attention to abiotic conditions, day time and choice of type of artificial lure.

Very important aspects such as computational complexity and effects of poor image quality are often neglected. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of current LBP variants and propose a taxonomy to more clearly group the prominent alternatives. Merits and demerits of the various LBP features and their underlying connections are also analyzed. We perform a large scale performance evaluation for texture classification, empirically assessing forty texture features including thirty two recent most promising LBP variants and eight non-LBP descriptors based on deep convolutional networks on thirteen widely-used texture datasets. The experiments are designed to measure their robustness against different classification challenges, including changes in rotation, scale, illumination, viewpoint, number of classes, different types of image degradation, and computational complexity. The best overall performance is obtained for the Median Robust Extended Local Binary Pattern (MRELBP) feature. For textures with very large appearance variations, Fisher vector pooling of deep Convolutional Neural Networks is clearly the best, but at the cost of very high computational complexity. The sensitivity to image degradations and computational complexity are among the key problems for most of the methods considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This is essential for programming neuromorphic systems based on memristor crossbars in order to achieve best deep learning capability. The memristor devices were formed using a 42 nm layer of LiNbO3 sandwiched between two metal electrodes. I-V curves demonstrate a typical and repeatable memristor characteristic from - 3 V to 3 V. Such devices have a continuous resistance range that has a maximum to minimum resistance ratio of about 100, and the ability to program intermediate resistance states. The results also show the ability to read the device symmetrically with a positive or negative voltage, and strong data retention after the programming phase. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To effectively integrate environmental aspects into product innovation processes, companies might have to significantly change some of the practices and habits of all the stakeholders involved and of the organisation. To complement the extensive literature on the (technical) \"hard side of ecodesign\", this article explores the promising \"soft side\", which considers company culture and human factors, by a multiple step literature review associated with a longitudinal action research in a large cosmetics company. Although a consistent prescriptive change model is still lacking in ecodesign literature, a strong convergence and complementarity is observed between the previous conclusions on ecodesign integration models and the emerging Transition Management approach designed for the sustainability issues faced by organisations. As a result, an \"ecodesign transition framework\" is proposed by combining a three-level systemic approach, considering both top-down planning and bottom-up innovation, with new types of interaction and dynamic cycles of action and learning, with a deep stakeholder management. This new framework was developed and positively applied to the company in a five-year experience to face the complex transition process, thus advancing the knowledge from social science for innovation and sustainability management challenges. Such approach could positively address change management issues and help companies evolve toward a more effective sustainable product innovation process, in the context of evolving business management practices that require progressive change and more human-based strategies.

These methods require training on a data set produced by an event generator where the true class labels are known. However, this may bias the network towards learning features associated with the approximations to QCD used in that generator which are not present in real data. We therefore investigate the effects of variations in the modeling of the parton shower on the performance of deep neural network taggers using jet images from hadronic W bosons at the LHC, including detector-related effects. By investigating network performance on samples from the Pythia, Herwig and Sherpa generators, we find differences of up to 50% in background rejection for fixed signal efficiency. We also introduce and study a method, which we dub zooming, for implementing scale invariance in neural-network-based taggers. We find that this leads to an improvement in performance across a wide range of jet transverse momenta. Our results emphasize the importance of gaining a detailed understanding of what aspects of jet physics these methods are exploiting.","Author":"","Title":"Parton shower uncertainties in jet substructure analyses with deep neural networks","ReviewID":"24","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Neuroimaging-based single subject prediction of brain disorders has gained increasing attention in recent years. Using a variety of neuroimaging modalities such as structural, functional and diffusion MRI, along with machine learning techniques, hundreds of studies have been carried out for accurate classification of patients with heterogeneous mental and neurodegenerative disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. More than 500 studies have been published during the past quarter century on single subject prediction focused on a multiple brain disorders. In the first part of this study, we provide a survey of more than 200 reports in this field with a focus on schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), depressive disorders, autism spectrum disease (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Detailed information about those studies such as sample size, type and number of extracted features and reported accuracy are summarized and discussed. To our knowledge, this is by far the most comprehensive review of neuroimaging-based single subject prediction of brain disorders. In the second part, we present our opinion on major pitfalls of those studies from a machine learning point of view. Common biases are discussed and suggestions are provided. Moreover, emerging trends such as decentralized data sharing, multimodal brain imaging, differential diagnosis, disease subtype classification and deep learning are also discussed. Based on this survey, there is extensive evidence showing the great potential of neuroimaging data for single subject prediction of various disorders. However, the main bottleneck of this exciting field is still the limited sample size, which could be potentially addressed by modern data sharing models such as the ones discussed in this paper. Emerging big data technologies and advanced data-intensive machine learning methodologies such as deep learning have coincided with an increasing need for accurate, robust and generalizable single subject prediction of brain disorders during an exciting time.

However, the structural complexity of most temperate watersheds (i.e. connections among shallow soils, deep aquifers, the atmosphere and streams) and the dynamic seasonal changes that occur within them (i.e., plant senescence which impacts evapotranspiration) create significant challenges to characterizing or quantifying hydrologic connectivity. The McMurdo Dry Valleys, a polar desert in Antarctica, provide a unique opportunity to study hydrologic connectivity because there is no vegetative cover (and therefore no transpiration), and no deep aquifers connected to surface soils or streams. Glacier melt provides stream flow to well-established channels and closed-basin, ice-covered lakes on the valley floor. Streams are also connected to shallow hyporheic zones along their lengths, which are bounded at similar to 75 cm depth by ice-cemented permafrost. These hydrologic features and connections provide water for and underpin biological communities. Hence, exchange of water among them provides a vector for exchange of energy and dissolved solutes. Connectivity is dynamic on timescales of a day to a flow season (6-12 weeks), as streamflow varies over these timescales. The timescales over which these connections occur is also dynamic. Exchanges between streams and hyporheic zones, for example, have been estimated to be as short as hours to as long as several weeks. These exchanges have significant implications for the biogeochemistry of these systems and the biotic communities in each feature. Here we evaluate the lessons we can learn about hydrologic connectivity in the MDV watersheds that are simplified in the context of processes occurring and water reservoirs included in the landscape, yet are sensitive to climate controls and contain substantial physical heterogeneity. We specifically explore several metrics that are simple and/or commonly employed in hydrologic analyses and interpret them in the context of connectivity between and among hydrologic features.

However, the evidence supporting this effect on implicit memory comes mainly from classical conditioning and avoidance tasks. The present work aims to determine whether ICSS would also improve the performance of rats in another type of implicit task such as cued simultaneous visual discrimination in the Morris Water Maze. The ICSS treatment was administered immediately after each of the five acquisition sessions and its effects on retention and reversal were evaluated 72 h later. Results showed that ICSS subjects committed fewer errors than Sham subjects and adopted more accurate trajectories during the acquisition of the task. This improvement was maintained until the probe test at 72 h. However, ICSS animals experienced more difficulties than the Sham group during the reversal of the same learning, reflecting an impairment in cognitive flexibility. We conclude that post-training ICSS could also be an effective treatment for improving implicit visual discrimination learning and memory. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Current computational models of object recognition, including recent deep-learning networks, generate these properties through a hierarchy of alternating selectivity-increasing filtering and tolerance-increasing pooling operations, similar to simple-complex cells operations [3-6]. Here, we prove that a class of hierarchical architectures and a broad set of biologically plausible learning rules generate approximate invariance to identity-preserving transformations at the top level of the processing hierarchy. However, all past models tested failed to reproduce the most salient property of an intermediate representation of a three-level face-processing hierarchy in the brain: mirror-symmetric tuning to head orientation [7]. Here, we demonstrate that one specific biologically plausible Hebb-type learning rule generates mirror-symmetric tuning to bilaterally symmetric stimuli, like faces, at intermediate levels of the architecture and show why it does so. Thus, the tuning properties of individual cells inside the visual stream appear to result from group properties of the stimuli they encode and to reflect the learning rules that sculpted the information-processing system within which they reside.","Author":"","Title":"View-Tolerant Face Recognition and Hebbian Learning Imply Mirror-Symmetric Neural Tuning to Head Orientation","ReviewID":"29","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"This study examines how demographic variables affect willingness to disclose and perceived risks of disclosing personally identifying information (PII, also referred to as personal data in Europe) in ecommerce in the United States and Estonia.

Online disclosure consciousness (ODC) is introduced as a framework to conceptualize, explain the study's findings, and empirically measure the gap between one's willingness to disclose and perceived risk pertaining to the overall 17-item index used in the study, the sub-indices, and particular items. The results show significant gaps among participants both within and across nations. Despite Estonia's advanced adoption and progressive policies and practices toward the Internet, Americans are more willing to disclose, and less concerned about perceived risks. The findings suggest willingness to disclose and risk aversion can and should be analyzed empirically together. The theoretical model provides an alternative conceptualization to the ideas of the privacy paradox, privacy calculus, and privacy cost-benefit ratios.

These psychological factors are modelled through the lens of Upper Echelon Theory (UET) to study their interrelationship and interdependency and further prioritize them to strategize appropriate managerial actions. The factors were identified through an exhaustive literature review and further confirmed by the experts in the field. A hybrid Interpretive Structural Modelling Analytic Network Process (ISM-ANP) approach has been adopted to establish the complex interrelationship among the psychological drivers and further to cluster and prioritize them. The main contribution of this study is composing directions and dominance of various psychological drivers to enhance decision-making process of managers towards the adoption of Green IT/IS. As long as decisions are made by individuals within organizations, this paper forms the basis of identifying individual-level factors important in motivating managers towards Green IT/IS adoption. The results of this study would help organizations and policy makers to understand and develop strategies to target and select an individual for managerial position with mind-set more towards environmental sustainability and Green IT/IS concepts. By applying the proposed methodology, organizations can classify and prioritize their action plans such as several educational methods to reinforce, foster and incline psychological factors to motivate their individuals to behave proenvironmentally and practice Green IT/IS initiatives to enhance environmental sustainability of their corporations.

In the tide of globalization and information technology, geopolitics has become an important subject for global pattern interpretation and policy making. It is essentially important to have a scientific and systematic review on international geopolitics to promote its development. Based on the bibliometric statistics, the paper reviews the research development of geopolitics on the Web of Science from 1996 to 2015. The history, journals, papers and key research areas of geopolitics have been revealed in the paper. By the analysis of bibliometric statistics, the number of papers recently published in the journals of political geography and related geography journals continues to increase. The key areas of geopolitical papers which are globally highly cited include geopolitical interpretation of the countries and borders, critical geopolitics, emotional geopolitics, feminist geopolitics and other topics. Before the year of 2000, the state and borders were hot topics of the geopolitical research. Yet since 2000, it has been the trend that the geopolitics is increasingly set in the context of geographical implications. At the same time, critical geopolitics appears to be the main area of geopolitical research, especially transitioning from traditional geopolitics towards the humanism-embeddedness (such as emotional geopolitics, feminist geopolitics). The paper then systematically reviews the branch trends of geopolitical research, including the borders and the territory, global geo-culture and geo-economics, Chinese models of geopolitics, resource conflicts and ecological politics, as well as emotional geopolitics. Finally, it puts forward the implication that Chinese geopolitical studies should reinforce the importance of geographical space and scale, use the process of description and multiple methods, as well as integrate humanistic thoughts, in order to further enrich the theories and practices of geopolitical research.","Author":"","Title":"Progress in international geopolitical research from 1996 to 2015","ReviewID":"2","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"We considered a sensor formation problem for target localization based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) data.

We contribute to this research stream by extending an oft-cited theory in the information security literature-protection motivation theory (PMT)-to include the relationship of insiders' psychological capital (PsyCap) with the mechanisms of PMT. PsyCap is a construct of role-breadth psychological capacities and resources embodying important work-related motivational resources. Therefore, given the varied facets central to PMT, determining the relationship of PsyCap with each distinct PMT mechanism is an important contribution. Furthermore, prior research has established that individuals can develop their PsyCap. Consequently, considering the relationship of role-breadth PsyCap with the PMT mechanisms provides an important and malleable, motivational antecedent that complements PMT and is absent from most assessments of the contemporary PMT model.

The study utilized a 17 item list of potential disclosure items (name, email address, etc.), categorized reliably into six sub-indices: contact information, payment information, life history information, financial/medical information, work-related information, and online account information. Online disclosure consciousness (ODC) is introduced as a framework to conceptualize, explain the study's findings, and empirically measure the gap between one's willingness to disclose and perceived risk pertaining to the overall 17-item index used in the study, the sub-indices, and particular items. The results show significant gaps among participants both within and across nations. Despite Estonia's advanced adoption and progressive policies and practices toward the Internet, Americans are more willing to disclose, and less concerned about perceived risks. The findings suggest willingness to disclose and risk aversion can and should be analyzed empirically together. The theoretical model provides an alternative conceptualization to the ideas of the privacy paradox, privacy calculus, and privacy cost-benefit ratios. Implications for theory, consumers, marketing practice, and public policy are discussed. Importantly, the study can inform increased adoption of ecommerce and the digital economy, while also protecting consumer's personal data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

These psychological factors are modelled through the lens of Upper Echelon Theory (UET) to study their interrelationship and interdependency and further prioritize them to strategize appropriate managerial actions. The factors were identified through an exhaustive literature review and further confirmed by the experts in the field. A hybrid Interpretive Structural Modelling Analytic Network Process (ISM-ANP) approach has been adopted to establish the complex interrelationship among the psychological drivers and further to cluster and prioritize them. The main contribution of this study is composing directions and dominance of various psychological drivers to enhance decision-making process of managers towards the adoption of Green IT/IS. As long as decisions are made by individuals within organizations, this paper forms the basis of identifying individual-level factors important in motivating managers towards Green IT/IS adoption. The results of this study would help organizations and policy makers to understand and develop strategies to target and select an individual for managerial position with mind-set more towards environmental sustainability and Green IT/IS concepts. By applying the proposed methodology, organizations can classify and prioritize their action plans such as several educational methods to reinforce, foster and incline psychological factors to motivate their individuals to behave proenvironmentally and practice Green IT/IS initiatives to enhance environmental sustainability of their corporations.

In the tide of globalization and information technology, geopolitics has become an important subject for global pattern interpretation and policy making. It is essentially important to have a scientific and systematic review on international geopolitics to promote its development. Based on the bibliometric statistics, the paper reviews the research development of geopolitics on the Web of Science from 1996 to 2015. The history, journals, papers and key research areas of geopolitics have been revealed in the paper. By the analysis of bibliometric statistics, the number of papers recently published in the journals of political geography and related geography journals continues to increase. The key areas of geopolitical papers which are globally highly cited include geopolitical interpretation of the countries and borders, critical geopolitics, emotional geopolitics, feminist geopolitics and other topics. Before the year of 2000, the state and borders were hot topics of the geopolitical research. Yet since 2000, it has been the trend that the geopolitics is increasingly set in the context of geographical implications. At the same time, critical geopolitics appears to be the main area of geopolitical research, especially transitioning from traditional geopolitics towards the humanism-embeddedness (such as emotional geopolitics, feminist geopolitics). The paper then systematically reviews the branch trends of geopolitical research, including the borders and the territory, global geo-culture and geo-economics, Chinese models of geopolitics, resource conflicts and ecological politics, as well as emotional geopolitics. Finally, it puts forward the implication that Chinese geopolitical studies should reinforce the importance of geographical space and scale, use the process of description and multiple methods, as well as integrate humanistic thoughts, in order to further enrich the theories and practices of geopolitical research.","Author":"","Title":"Progress in international geopolitical research from 1996 to 2015","ReviewID":"2","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"We considered a sensor formation problem for target localization based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) data.

The proposed optimal formation of sensors is in the concentric ring formation and is shown to change in accordance with sensors' angular positions with respect to the line-of-sight vector from the reference sensor to the target. The proposed optimal sensor formations are compared in the context of estimation accuracy both in theory and by numerical experiments.

Over the last two decades, information systems have contributed to the transformation of customer interactions, enabling an unprecedented scale and scope of service personalization in the tourism industry. This paper reports the results of a mixed method study in a hotel that offers three contributions to the development and refinement of IT-enabled service personalization theory. It explores the role of signifiers in the design of customer service systems, showing that they significantly increase customer preference elicitation during the learning phase of the service personalization process. It then demonstrates that improved preference elicitation translates into higher customer service evaluations and value perceptions of the hotel. Finally, our study shows that IT-enabled service personalization creates financial benefits for the hotel via revenue share-shift from costly intermediated to direct distribution channels.

However in reality the infusion rate usually varies with respect to time, due to the natural (temporal or random) fluctuation of environments or clinical needs. In this work we study a non-autonomous chemotherapy model where the injection rate and injection concentration of the chemotherapy agent are time-dependent. In particular, we prove that the non-autonomous dynamical system generated by solutions to the non-autonomous chemotherapy system possesses a pullback attractor. In addition, we investigate the detailed interior structures of the pullback attractor to provide crucial information on the effectiveness of the treatment. The main analytical tool used is the theory of non-autonomous dynamical systems. Numerical experiments are carried out to supplement the analysis and illustrate the effectiveness of different types of infusions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

On the basis of potential energy distribution detailed vibrational assignments of observed FT-IR and FT-Raman bands have been proposed. Using molecular electrostatic potential map relative reactivities towards electrophilic and nucleophilic attack are predicted. The first and second hyperpolarizabilities are calculated and the first hyperpolarizability of the title compounds are greater than that of the standard NLO material urea. Molecular studies reveal that the predicted binding affinities of the best poses were -8.7 kcal/mol for BACPC, -9.0 kcal/mol for CBACPC, and -8.8 kcal/mol for the original inhibitor. Efforts were made in order to investigate local reactivity properties of title compounds as well. In order to do so we have calculated average local ionization energy (ALIE) surfaces, Fukui functions, bond dissociation energies (BDE) (within the framework of DFT calculations) and radial distribution functions (RDF) (within the molecular dynamics simulations). ALIE surfaces and Fukui functions gave us initial information on the site reactivity towards electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks. BDE indicated locations that might be prone to autoxidation mechanism, while RDF indicated which atoms of title molecules are having pronounced interactions with water. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

And gender is considered as the moderating factor in the model. Using 215 valid data from the WeChat users in China, the model is empirically assessed by PLS-SEM. Results show that three types of gratifications positively affect WeChat users' liking behavior: hedonic gratification (enjoyment), social gratification (social support) and utilitarian gratification (information seeking). In particular, enjoyment plays the most important role in determining the liking behavior, followed by social support and information seeking.

Its successful implementation depends on users' acceptance. However, no study exists exploring the factors that influence students' acceptance of mobile-based assessment. Furthermore, research that combines acceptance with motivational factors is limited. The current study builds on the theoretical framework of the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) of Motivation and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and proposes the Mobile Based Assessment-Motivational and Acceptance Model (MBA-MAM), a combined model that explains and predicts Behavioral Intention to Use Mobile-based Assessment. One-hundred and forty students (N = 140) from a European senior-level secondary school participated in mobile-assisted assessment activities and self-reported their perceptions about MBA afterwards. Structured equation modeling used to analyze quantitative survey data. The study confirmed the proposed model, explaining and predicting students' intention to use MBA in terms of both acceptance and motivational (autonomy, competence and relatedness) factors.

Digital piracy is the unauthorized and illegal digital copying or distribution of digital goods, such as music, movies, and software. To date, researchers have used disparate theories and models to understand individuals' motivations for stealing and sharing digital content. To establish a unified understanding of digital piracy research in order to set an agenda for future studies, we conducted a meta-analysis of the literature. We analyzed 257 unique studies with a total of 126,622 participants to examine all the major constructs and covariates used in the literature. Using social cognitive theory, we were able to resolve several contradictions and trade-offs found in the digital piracy literature. Further, our meta-analytic results suggest that four key sets of factors maximize prediction: (1) outcome expectancies (considerations of rewards, perceived risks, and perceived sanctions), (2) social learning (positive and negative social influence and piracy habit), (3) self-efficacy and self-regulation (perceived behavioral control and low self-control), and (4) moral disengagement (morality, immorality, and neutralization).

Analyzed data shows that the moderating impact of trust was significant in one path, which was perceived desirability (stemming from the diffusion of innovation theory and representing the technological view). Trust did not moderate the impacts of organizational and environmental variables. The findings provided insights into how existing relationships between trading partners may not be flexible enough to absorb new technology.

This awareness has resulted in a research stream focused on the performance of protective behaviors. We contribute to this research stream by extending an oft-cited theory in the information security literature-protection motivation theory (PMT)-to include the relationship of insiders' psychological capital (PsyCap) with the mechanisms of PMT. PsyCap is a construct of role-breadth psychological capacities and resources embodying important work-related motivational resources. Therefore, given the varied facets central to PMT, determining the relationship of PsyCap with each distinct PMT mechanism is an important contribution. Furthermore, prior research has established that individuals can develop their PsyCap. Consequently, considering the relationship of role-breadth PsyCap with the PMT mechanisms provides an important and malleable, motivational antecedent that complements PMT and is absent from most assessments of the contemporary PMT model. We find support for PsyCap's relationship with the mechanisms of PMT and suggest opportunities to develop PsyCap in conjunction with other organizational security efforts. We present our findings, discuss their implications for research and practice, and highlight several opportunities for future research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This gap between behavior and concern is called the privacy paradox. Several theories have been explored to explain this, but with inconsistent and incomplete results. This study investigates the paradox using a construal level theory lens.

Results from a field survey suggest that all push (risk), pull (trust, critical mass) and mooring (switching cost, social norm) factors each have direct impacts on switching intention. Mooring factors fail to moderate the impact of push factor on switching intention, but they are able to moderate the effects of pull factors on switching intention.

Moreover, the vast amount of online health information some of it of dubious quality makes the task of finding relevant information difficult. Therefore, this experiment also tested an approach to improving the online health information seeking process by tailoring search engine results about influenza to the emotional action tendencies of users.

Remember responses involve eyewitness identification of the target person as an episodic memory task, because it implies retrieving information about the target person in the place and at the time of the event. Know responses, in contrast, engage recognition based on familiarity or perceptual facilitation, that is, as a semantic memory task. To explore the relation between retrieval experiences and recognition accuracy, 86 participants took part in a recognition task with two conditions: one with an interpolated target absent line-up and the other only with the target present line-up. Accuracy of recognition and retrieval experience was measured. The results showed that, having previously participated in a target-absent line-up, increased omissions, while the number of hits decreased. Furthermore, participants' know responses were associated to false recognition, whilst remember responses were associated to hits in recognition. Thus, asking eyewitnesses to inform about the kind of retrieval experience in which they based their recognition responses, may serve as a reliable indicator of accuracy in recognition. Future studies are needed to investigate whether this is also the case in natural settings.","Author":"","Title":"RETRIVAL EXPERIENCE AS AN ACCURATE INDICATOR OF PERSON IDENTIFICATION IN LINE-UPS","ReviewID":"11","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Conference Conference: International Conference on Instrumentation, Measurement, Circuits and Systems (ICIMCS 2011) Location: Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA Date: DEC 12-13, 2011","Author":"","Title":"A HYBRID GA AND ACTIVE LEARNING SVM MODEL FOR RELEVANCE FEEDBACK IN THE CONTENT-BASED IMAGES RETRIVAL","ReviewID":"12","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Conference Conference: 2nd International Conference on Challenges in Environmental Science and Computer Engineering (CESCE) Location: Haikou, PEOPLES R CHINA Date: DEC 14-15, 2011","Author":"","Title":"Multi-level Semantic Characterization and Refinement for Web Image Search","ReviewID":"13","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"Conference Conference: IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Control (ICECC) Location: Ningbo, PEOPLES R CHINA Date: SEP 09-11, 2011 Sponsor(s):IEEE; Ningbo Univ; Key Lab Sci & Tech Natl Def (KLSTND)","Author":"","Title":"An information retrieval scheme for Delay and Tolerance Networks","ReviewID":"14","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"As part of a general strategy to integrate the health care enterprise, Austria plans to connect the Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) of all radiological institutions into a nationwide network.

This paper seeks to outline why there is a need to develop a UK-specific version of this well-known and very popular free service, and what practical approaches have taken towards bringing a Beta service live for all to use and feedback on. Design/methodology/approach - The approach to development of UKPMC has been consultative and iterative. Through surveys, focus groups and one-to-one user tests the aim has been to develop a service which can fit neatly into a researcher's workflow. Coordinating the programme itself has required close collaboration between organisations which are quite diverse both culturally and administratively. Findings - Through developing UKPMC, technology has been melded together with practical delivery. The text mining functionality that the service now offers is truly innovative, and there is further potential to develop this. The recently launched Beta service (beta.ukpmc.ac.uk) will continue to be honed particularly its text mining functionality through ongoing user consultation and feedback. It is perceived that this flexible approach to development is essential in offering a service that is truly useful for the UK's life sciences research community and offers a compelling reason to use it as a valid and ground breaking alternative to Pub Med Central (the US version). Originality/value - The originality and value of UKPMC should be judged by the research community.

Many of these reports relate to breakthroughs in materials science, including fabrication of new 2-D materials such as graphene oxide, and structured materials such as metal organic frameworks. Interestingly, the ultra-high permeances described are invariably measured for flat sheet membranes, in highly dilute systems. The effects of pressure gradients across the membrane, and the effects of concentration polarisation at significant, real world concentrations are not usually considered. In practise, membrane modules, rather than flat membrane sheets, are used in industrial processes. In concentrated systems, employing modules, concentration polarisation and module pressure drops will also affect overall process performance. This work examines the extent to which increasing membrane permeance can impact on processes employing membrane modules, considering both spiral-wound and hollow fibre configurations. Our key conclusion is that ultra-high permeance membranes will not be able to make a significant impact on process efficiency with current module designs; and our recommendation is that fresh research into module and process design is required.","Author":"","Title":"Will ultra-high permeance membranes lead to ultra-efficient processes?

The study aims at providing a systematic investigation of the effect of atomistic defect on thermal-mechanical properties, such as Young's modulus, shear modulus, specific heat capacity, and linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), of phosphorene sheets using molecular dynamics simulation incorporated with Nos,-Hoover Langevin thermostat. The calculation results show that the Young's modulus, shear modulus, specific heat capacity, and CTE of armchair and zigzag types of phosphorene sheets decrease with the increasing vacancy defect ratio. The specific heat capacity and linear CTE would rise with increasing temperature at low temperatures and converge to a constant value as temperature is larger than 600 K.

Both enthalpy and volume relaxation kinetics were found to be uninfluenced by Se addition. On the other hand, DSC crystallization behavior changed significantly with increasing Se content: initial addition of Se partially delays and decelerates both the initial Te precipitation and the consequent volume-located crystallization of GeTe and Te; additional increase of Se content then further delays and separates the volume-located crystallization processes but the initial surface Te precipitation is no longer affected. From this point of view the fine compositional tuning of basic thermal stability of Ge-Te-Se infrared glasses appears meaningless.

Although PFC was originally introduced as a phenomenological model in materials science (Elder et al., 2002), it was later shown that it can be derived from density functional theory (DFT) by certain approximations (Elder et al., 2007) providing a significant predictive capability for PFC. However, these approximations in PFC, similar to any other higher-scale computational model derived from DFT, have introduced intrinsic challenges for quantifying of PFC for specific materials; i. e. determining PFC model parameters for specific materials. The objective of this article is to present a variety of possible approaches that can be used for quantifying PFC for solidification/melting modeling. Thus, we present a reformulation of PFC model containing two extra parameters and four possible quantification approaches. Then, representative material properties corresponding for each individual approach are calculated and compared with their available experimental/computational counterparts in literature. The representative material properties include elastic constants, liquid and solid densities, liquid structure factor, latent heat, and solid-liquid interface free energy and its anisotropy. We discuss the quantitative capabilities of each quantification approach regarding their prediction of the mentioned representative material properties for Fe as an example material. The discussion provided in this study can be used as a guideline to select the proper quantification approach for researchers who need to use PFC for quantitative modeling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

In the present study, we investigate the stacking fault energy (SFE) variations of binary Co-based alloys with different alloying elements (Cr, W, Mo, Ni, Mn, Al and Fe) and concentrations (from 0 to 20 at.%) over a broad range of temperatures (from 0 to 1000 K) by computational thermodynamic approach and first-principles density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations combined with quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). Our work presents a fundamental understanding of the theoretical SFE calculation and the deviations involved in computational thermodynamic approach and first-principles calculations systematically for the first time. It concludes that the SFEs of binary Co-based alloys are increased as the increased of temperature, Ni, Mn, Al and Fe concentrations while the SFEs are decreased as the increased of Cr, W and Mo concentrations qualitatively. Quantitatively, the SFE differences of these two methods are relatively small (lower than 27 mJ/m(2)). The SFE variations can be explained regarding the charge density distributions and the atomic bonding. These results also highlight the critical role of Suzuki effect and the key for the SFE variations is the alloying elements only in the vicinity of the fault plane. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we demonstrate that these C/W foams may be stabilized with viscoelastic aqueous phases formed with a single zwitterionic surfactant at a concentration of only 1% (w/v) in DI water and over a wide range of salinity. Moreover, they are stable with a foam quality phi up to 0.98 even for temperatures up to 120 degrees C. The properties of aqueous viscoelastic solutions and foams containing these solutions are examined for a series of zwitterionic amidopropylcarbobetaines, R-ONHC3H6N(CH3)(2)CH2CO2, where R is varied from C12-14 (coco) to C-18 (oleyl) to C-22 (erucyl). For the surfactants with long C-18 and C-22 tails, the relaxation times from complex rheology indicate the presence of viscoelastic wormlike micelles over a wide range in salinity and pH, given the high surfactant packing fraction. The apparent viscosities of these ultralow water content foams reached more than 120 cP with stabilities more than 30-fold over those for foams formed with the non-viscoelastic C12-14 surfactant. At 90 degrees C, the foam morphology was composed of similar to 35 mu m diameter bubbles with a polyhedral texture. The apparent foam viscosity typically increased with phi, and then dropped at phi values higher than 0.95-0.98. The Ostwald ripening rate was slower for foams with viscoelastic versus non-viscoelastic lamellae as shown by optical microscopy, as a consequence of slower lamellar drainage rates. The ability to achieve high stabilities for ultralow water content C/W foams over a wide temperature range is of interest in various technologies including polymer and materials science, CO2 enhanced oil recovery, CO2 sequestration (by greater control of the CO2 flow patterns), and possibly even hydraulic fracturing with minimal use of water to reduce the requirements for wastewater disposal.

This review focuses on exemplary cases of APXPS experiments, giving special consideration to experimental techniques, challenges, and limitations specific to distinct condensed matter interfaces. We discuss APXPS experiments on solid/vapor interfaces, including the special case of 2D films of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride on metal substrates with intercalated gas molecules, liquid/vapor interfaces, and liquid/solid interfaces, which are a relatively new class of interfaces being probed by APXPS. We also provide a critical evaluation of the persistent limitations and challenges of APXPS, as well as the current experimental frontiers.","Author":"","Title":"Ambient pressure photoelectron spectroscopy: Practical considerations and experimental frontiers","ReviewID":"13","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"This paper presents an innovative explosive welding technology, namely Universal Substitutive Explosive Welding technique, which was recently developed by Australian Defence Science and Technology Group to improve the survivability and mobility of military vehicles. The new technique is superior to the existing industrial explosive welding ones in terms of integrity, quality and stability. It is able to significantly upgrade the hardness upper limit of target material and ensure the perfect welding bond between the flyer (soft) and target (hard) panels without size limitation of target panel. Experimental results show that using the new technique raised the ballistic velocity limit (V-50) of the explosively welded panel by up to 20% and reduced the bulge depth (related to dynamic plasticity) significantly without any rupture or fragmentation issues. Charpy impact test on the sample fabricated by the new technique showed strong recovery effects with time with no transition temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the colloidal electrostatic interaction is rapid and uncontrolled, the strong interaction usually leads to large and irregular aggregates. Therefore, control of the electrostatic interaction in order to resulting well-defined nanostructures remains a challenge. Here we report on a general and simple method to moderate the wild electrostatic interaction. Direct mixing of stock solutions containing anionic superparamagnetic nanoparticles and widespread cationic homopolyelectrolytes at an appropriate ionic strength generates aggregates with controlled shape and morphology. The simple and versatile methodology not only efficiently moderates electrostatic interactions but also enables the corresponding growth mechanism to be revealed by light scattering and electron microscopy as aggregation occurs at much slower timescales. The present results carry important implications for both practical applications and understanding on nanoscale electrostatic interaction between colloids. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For most of the 20th Century, terahertz radiation, then referred to as sub-millimeter wave or far-infrared radiation, was mainly utilized by astronomers and some spectroscopists. Following the development of laser based terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in the 1980s and 1990s the field of THz science and technology expanded rapidly, to the extent that it now touches many areas from fundamental science to 'real world' applications. For example THz radiation is being used to optimize materials for new solar cells, and may also be a key technology for the next generation of airport security scanners. While the field was emerging it was possible to keep track of all new developments, however now the field has grown so much that it is increasingly difficult to follow the diverse range of new discoveries and applications that are appearing. At this point in time, when the field of THz science and technology is moving from an emerging to a more established and interdisciplinary field, it is apt to present a roadmap to help identify the breadth and future directions of the field. The aim of this roadmap is to present a snapshot of the present state of THz science and technology in 2017, and provide an opinion on the challenges and opportunities that the future holds. To be able to achieve this aim, we have invited a group of international experts to write 18 sections that cover most of the key areas of THz science and technology. We hope that The 2017 Roadmap on THz science and technology will prove to be a useful resource by providing a wide ranging introduction to the capabilities of THz radiation for those outside or just entering the field as well as providing perspective and breadth for those who are well established. We also feel that this review should serve as a useful guide for government and funding agencies.","Author":"","Title":"The 2017 terahertz science and technology roadmap","ReviewID":"17","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"As the number of personal exposure studies expands and trends favor greater openness and transparency in the health sciences, ethical issues arise around reporting back individual results for contaminants without clear health guidelines. Past research demonstrates that research participants want their results even when the health implications are not known. The experiences of researchers and institutional review boards (IRBs) in studies that have reported personal chemical exposures can provide insights about ethical and practical approaches while also revealing areas of continued uncertainty. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 researchers and nine IRB members from seven personal exposure studies across the United States to investigate their experiences and attitudes about the report-back process. Researchers reported multiple benefits of report back, including increasing retention and recruitment, advancing environmental health literacy, empowering study participants to take actions to reduce exposures, encouraging shifts in government and industry practices, and helping researchers discover sources of exposure through participant consultation. Researchers also reported challenges, including maintaining ongoing contact with participants, adopting protocols for notification of high exposures to chemicals without health guidelines, developing meaningful report-back materials, and resource limitations. IRB members reported concern for potential harm to participants, such as anxiety about personal results and counterproductive behavior changes. In contrast, researchers who have conducted personal report-back in their studies said that participants did not appear overly alarmed and noted that worry can be a positive outcome to motivate action to reduce harmful exposures. While key concerns raised during the early days of report-back have been substantially resolved for scientists with report-back experience, areas of uncertainty remain. These include ethical tensions surrounding the responsibility of researchers to leverage study results and resources to assist participants in policy or community-level actions to reduce chemical exposures, and how to navigate report-back to vulnerable populations.","Author":"","Title":"Researcher and institutional review board perspectives on the benefits and challenges of reporting back biomonitoring and environmental exposure results","ReviewID":"18","Date":"June 17, 2005"},{"Overall":"1.0","Content":"The art and science of folding intricate three-dimensional structures out of paper has occupied artists, designers, engineers, and mathematicians for decades, culminating in the design of deployable structures and mechanical metamaterials. Here we investigate the axial compressibility of origami cylinders, i.e., cylindrical structures folded from rectangular sheets of paper. We prove, using geometric arguments, that a general fold pattern only allows for a finite number of isometric cylindrical embeddings. Therefore, compressibility of such structures requires either stretching the material or deforming the folds. Our result considerably restricts the space of constructions that must be searched when designing new types of origami-based rigid-foldable deployable structures and metamaterials.","Author":"","Title":"On the Incompressibility of Cylindrical Origami Patterns","ReviewID":"19","Date":"June 17, 2005"}]}
