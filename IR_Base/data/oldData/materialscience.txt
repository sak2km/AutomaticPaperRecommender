Feasible Relation between Glutathione Peroxidase and Febrile Seizure
Abstract:
Objective We aimed to determine the relationship between serum glutathione peroxidase and febrile seizure. Materials & Methods In this case-control study, 43 children with simple febrile seizure (case group) were compared with 43 febrile children without seizure (control group) in terms of serum glutathione peroxidase level, measured by ELISA method. This study was conducted in Qazvin Children Hospital, Qazvin University of Medical Sciences in Qazvin, Iran in 2012-2013. The results were analyzed and compared in two groups. Results From 43 children 24 (53%) were male and 19 (47%) were female in children with simple febrile seizure, and 26 (60%) were male and 17 (40%) were female in febrile children without seizure (control group) (P=0.827). Serum glutathione peroxidase level was 166 U/ml (SD=107) in the case group and 141 U/ml (SD=90.5) in the control group of no significant difference. Conclusion There was no significant relationship between serum glutathione peroxidase and simple febrile seizure. Thus, it seems that glutathione peroxidase, an essential component of antioxidant system, does not play any role in the pathogenesis of simple febrile seizure.

High-Performance Superconductors for Fusion Nuclear Science Facility
Abstract:
High-performance superconducting magnets play an important role in the design of the next step large-scale, high-field fusion reactors such as the fusion nuclear science facility (FNSF) and the spherical tokamak (ST) pilot plant beyond ITER. Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory is currently leading the design studies of the FNSF and the ST pilot plant study. ITER, which is under construction in the south of France, utilizes the state-of-the-art low temperature superconducting magnet technology based on the cable-in-conduit conductor design, where over a thousand multifilament Nb3Sn superconducting strands are twisted together to form a high-current-carrying cable inserted into a steel jacket for coil windings. We present design options of the high-performance superconductors in the winding pack for the FNSF toroidal field magnet system based on the toroidal field radial build from the system code. For the low temperature superconductor options, the advanced J(c) Nb3Sn RRP strands (J(c) > 1000 A/mm(2) at 16 T, 4 K) from Oxford Superconducting Technology are under consideration. For the high-temperature superconductor options, the rectangular-shaped high-current HTS cable made of stacked YBCO tapes will be considered to validate feasibility of TF coil winding pack design for the ST-FNSF magnets.

Synthesis of graphene and related two-dimensional materials for bioelectronics devices
Abstract:
In recent years, graphene and related two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as exotic materials in nearly every fields of fundamental science and applied engineering. The latest progress has shown that these 2D materials could have a profound impact on bioelectronics devices. For the construction of these bioelectronics devices, these 2D materials were generally synthesized by the processes of exfoliation and chemical vapor deposition. In particular, the macrostructures of these 2D materials have also been realized by these two processes, which have shown great potentials in the self-supported and special-purpose biosensors. Due to the high specific surface area, subtle electron properties, abundant surface atoms of these 2D materials, the as-constructed bioelectronics devices have exhibited enhanced performance in the sensing of small biomolecules, heavy metals, pH, protein and DNA. The aim of this review article is to provide a comprehensive scientific progress in the synthesis of 2D materials for the construction of five typical bioelectronics devices (electrochemical biosensors, FET-based biosensors, piezoelectric devices, electrochemiluminescence devices and supercapacitors) and to overview the present status and future perspective of the applications of these bioelectronics devices based on 2D materials.

Recent advances in graphene-based nanomaterials for fabricating electrochemical hydrogen peroxide sensors
Abstract:
Due to the large specific surface area, extraordinary mechanical flexibility, chemical stability, and superior electrical and thermal conductivities, graphene (G)-based materials have recently opened up an exciting field in the science and technology of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials with continuously growing academic and technological impetus. In the past several years, graphene-based materials have been well designed, synthesized, and investigated for sensing applications. In this review, we discuss the synthesis and application of graphene-based 2D nanomaterials for the fabrication of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrochemical sensors. In particular, graphene-based nanomaterials as immobilization matrix of heme proteins for the fabrication of enzymatic H2O2 electrochemical biosensors is first summarized. Then, the application of graphene-based electrocatalysts (metal-free, noble-metals and non-noble metals) in constructing non-enzymatic H2O2 electrochemical sensors is discussed in detail. We hope that this review is helpful to push forward the advancement of this academic issue (189 references). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: 
Will ultra-high permeance membranes lead to ultra-efficient processes? Challenges for molecular separations in liquid systems
Abstract:
An increasing number of reports in the scientific literature describe membranes with ultra-high permeance which might revolutionise molecular separations in liquid systems by making separation processes dramatically more efficient. Many of these reports relate to breakthroughs in materials science, including fabrication of new 2-D materials such as graphene oxide, and structured materials such as metal organic frameworks. Interestingly, the ultra-high permeances described are invariably measured for flat sheet membranes, in highly dilute systems. The effects of pressure gradients across the membrane, and the effects of concentration polarisation at significant, real world concentrations are not usually considered. In practise, membrane modules, rather than flat membrane sheets, are used in industrial processes. In concentrated systems, employing modules, concentration polarisation and module pressure drops will also affect overall process performance. This work examines the extent to which increasing membrane permeance can impact on processes employing membrane modules, considering both spiral-wound and hollow fibre configurations. Our key conclusion is that ultra-high permeance membranes will not be able to make a significant impact on process efficiency with current module designs; and our recommendation is that fresh research into module and process design is required.

4D bioprinting: the next-generation technology for biofabrication enabled by stimuli-responsive materials
Abstract:
Four-dimensional (4D) bioprinting, encompassing a wide range of disciplines including bioengineering, materials science, chemistry, and computer sciences, is emerging as the next-generation biofabrication technology. By utilizing stimuli-responsive materials and advanced three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting strategies, 4D bioprinting aims to create dynamic 3D patterned biological structures that can transform their shapes or behavior under various stimuli. In this review, we highlight the potential use of various stimuli-responsive materials for 4D printing and their extension into biofabrication. We first discuss the state of the art and limitations associated with current 3D printing modalities and their transition into the inclusion of the additional time dimension. We then suggest the potential use of different stimuli-responsive biomaterials as the bioink that may achieve 4D bioprinting where transformation of fabricated biological constructs can be realized. We finally conclude with future perspectives.

Influence of structural defect on thermal-mechanical properties of phosphorene sheets
Abstract:
Since the exciting discovery of graphene, there has been a huge growth in research in material science on finding novel nanostructured materials with advanced material properties. Recently, a novel two-dimensional material, i.e., phosphorene sheets with a characteristic puckered structure, has been explored. The study aims at providing a systematic investigation of the effect of atomistic defect on thermal-mechanical properties, such as Young's modulus, shear modulus, specific heat capacity, and linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), of phosphorene sheets using molecular dynamics simulation incorporated with Nos,-Hoover Langevin thermostat. The calculation results show that the Young's modulus, shear modulus, specific heat capacity, and CTE of armchair and zigzag types of phosphorene sheets decrease with the increasing vacancy defect ratio. The specific heat capacity and linear CTE would rise with increasing temperature at low temperatures and converge to a constant value as temperature is larger than 600 K. Besides, the calculated specific heat capacity of the two types of phosphorene sheets all closely follows the Debye T (3)-law at low temperatures.

In situ hard X-ray transmission microscopy for material science
Abstract:
Hard X-ray transmission microscopy based on refractive X-ray optics can be employed as a tool in material science to investigate buried-in microstructures in two or three dimensions with spatial resolution approaching 100 nm. Switching from monochromatic to radiation with a broader bandwidth, frame rates down to a few milliseconds can be realized, opening new possibilities for in situ studies of microstructure evolution and response to external fields at spatiotemporal resolutions that go well beyond previous benchmarks, demonstrated by similar to 200 nm resolution tomograms of eutectic microstructures acquired in less than 2 s. The microscope can also be operated in Zernike phase contrast mode, which expands the range of possible applications to cases which otherwise would produce only very faint contrast. A few possible application areas for the microscope are illustrated by a selection of material science test cases.

Se-doped GeTe4 glasses for far-infrared optical fibers
Abstract:
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermomechanical analysis (TMA) were used to study thermokinetic behavior of Ge21SeyTe79-y infrared glasses (for y up to 8 at.% of Se). Glass transition kinetics was described in terms of the Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan model and the relaxation motions were interpreted using Raman spectroscopy data. Both enthalpy and volume relaxation kinetics were found to be uninfluenced by Se addition. On the other hand, DSC crystallization behavior changed significantly with increasing Se content: initial addition of Se partially delays and decelerates both the initial Te precipitation and the consequent volume-located crystallization of GeTe and Te; additional increase of Se content then further delays and separates the volume-located crystallization processes but the initial surface Te precipitation is no longer affected. From this point of view the fine compositional tuning of basic thermal stability of Ge-Te-Se infrared glasses appears meaningless. On the contrary, glass workability window (determined by means of the TMA crystallization experiments) was found to be significantly affected by Se addition, emphasizing the importance of this type of measurements for the glass technology and material science. The 4 at.% Se content was found optimal with respect to fiber-drawing procedure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: 
On the nature of the room temperature ferromagnetism in nanoparticulate co-doped ZnO thin films prepared by EB-PVD
Abstract:
The complete comprehension of the magnetic properties of the dilute magnetic oxides has emerged as one of the major challenges in the fields of materials science and condensed matter physics. Up to now, there is no consensus about the mechanism behind the so often observed room temperature ferromagnetism. However it is well known that defects plays an important role in the context. Here we present the study of the correlation between the structural and the magnetic properties of nanoparticulate Co-doped ZnO (Zn1-xCoxO, x = 0.02 and 0.08) thin films prepared via Electron Beam-Physical Vapor Deposition. The structural results confirms the incorporation of the Co2+ ions into the ZnO host matrix with no secondary phases. Magnetic measurements show a robust ferromagnetic order for the thin film with x = 0.08, whereas for the sample with x = 0.02 only a tiny ferromagnetism were observed. We could explain the differences in the magnetic behavior entirely under the scope of the spin-split impurity band model. In this work we also present convincing evidences of the no correlation between the oxygen vacancies and the desired room temperature ferromagnetism. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: 
On the quantification of phase-field crystals model for computational simulations of solidification in metals
Abstract:
Phase-field crystals (PFC) is an atomistic model on diffusive time scale with the capability to simulate solidification/melting and the subsequent nano-structural evolution while naturally accounting for elasticity and plasticity. Although PFC was originally introduced as a phenomenological model in materials science (Elder et al., 2002), it was later shown that it can be derived from density functional theory (DFT) by certain approximations (Elder et al., 2007) providing a significant predictive capability for PFC. However, these approximations in PFC, similar to any other higher-scale computational model derived from DFT, have introduced intrinsic challenges for quantifying of PFC for specific materials; i. e. determining PFC model parameters for specific materials. The objective of this article is to present a variety of possible approaches that can be used for quantifying PFC for solidification/melting modeling. Thus, we present a reformulation of PFC model containing two extra parameters and four possible quantification approaches. Then, representative material properties corresponding for each individual approach are calculated and compared with their available experimental/computational counterparts in literature. The representative material properties include elastic constants, liquid and solid densities, liquid structure factor, latent heat, and solid-liquid interface free energy and its anisotropy. We discuss the quantitative capabilities of each quantification approach regarding their prediction of the mentioned representative material properties for Fe as an example material. The discussion provided in this study can be used as a guideline to select the proper quantification approach for researchers who need to use PFC for quantitative modeling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

Title: 
Effects of alloying elements concentrations and temperatures on the stacking fault energies of Co-based alloys by computational thermodynamic approach and first-principles calculations
Abstract:
The atomic-scale microstructural and compositional modification of materials are one of the most promising developments of modern materials science. In the present study, we investigate the stacking fault energy (SFE) variations of binary Co-based alloys with different alloying elements (Cr, W, Mo, Ni, Mn, Al and Fe) and concentrations (from 0 to 20 at.%) over a broad range of temperatures (from 0 to 1000 K) by computational thermodynamic approach and first-principles density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations combined with quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). Our work presents a fundamental understanding of the theoretical SFE calculation and the deviations involved in computational thermodynamic approach and first-principles calculations systematically for the first time. It concludes that the SFEs of binary Co-based alloys are increased as the increased of temperature, Ni, Mn, Al and Fe concentrations while the SFEs are decreased as the increased of Cr, W and Mo concentrations qualitatively. Quantitatively, the SFE differences of these two methods are relatively small (lower than 27 mJ/m(2)). The SFE variations can be explained regarding the charge density distributions and the atomic bonding. These results also highlight the critical role of Suzuki effect and the key for the SFE variations is the alloying elements only in the vicinity of the fault plane. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title: 
High temperature ultralow water content carbon dioxide-in-water foam stabilized with viscoelastic zwitterionic surfactants
Abstract:
Ultralow water content carbon dioxide-in-water (C/W) foams with gas phase volume fractions (phi) above 0.95 (that is <0.05 water) tend to be inherently unstable given that the large capillary pressures that cause the lamellar films to thin. Herein, we demonstrate that these C/W foams may be stabilized with viscoelastic aqueous phases formed with a single zwitterionic surfactant at a concentration of only 1% (w/v) in DI water and over a wide range of salinity. Moreover, they are stable with a foam quality phi up to 0.98 even for temperatures up to 120 degrees C. The properties of aqueous viscoelastic solutions and foams containing these solutions are examined for a series of zwitterionic amidopropylcarbobetaines, R-ONHC3H6N(CH3)(2)CH2CO2, where R is varied from C12-14 (coco) to C-18 (oleyl) to C-22 (erucyl). For the surfactants with long C-18 and C-22 tails, the relaxation times from complex rheology indicate the presence of viscoelastic wormlike micelles over a wide range in salinity and pH, given the high surfactant packing fraction. The apparent viscosities of these ultralow water content foams reached more than 120 cP with stabilities more than 30-fold over those for foams formed with the non-viscoelastic C12-14 surfactant. At 90 degrees C, the foam morphology was composed of similar to 35 mu m diameter bubbles with a polyhedral texture. The apparent foam viscosity typically increased with phi, and then dropped at phi values higher than 0.95-0.98. The Ostwald ripening rate was slower for foams with viscoelastic versus non-viscoelastic lamellae as shown by optical microscopy, as a consequence of slower lamellar drainage rates. The ability to achieve high stabilities for ultralow water content C/W foams over a wide temperature range is of interest in various technologies including polymer and materials science, CO2 enhanced oil recovery, CO2 sequestration (by greater control of the CO2 flow patterns), and possibly even hydraulic fracturing with minimal use of water to reduce the requirements for wastewater disposal.

Title: 
Ambient pressure photoelectron spectroscopy: Practical considerations and experimental frontiers
Abstract:
Over the past several decades, ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) has emerged as a powerful technique for in situ and operando investigations of chemical reactions under relevant ambient atmospheres far from ultra-high vacuum conditions. This review focuses on exemplary cases of APXPS experiments, giving special consideration to experimental techniques, challenges, and limitations specific to distinct condensed matter interfaces. We discuss APXPS experiments on solid/vapor interfaces, including the special case of 2D films of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride on metal substrates with intercalated gas molecules, liquid/vapor interfaces, and liquid/solid interfaces, which are a relatively new class of interfaces being probed by APXPS. We also provide a critical evaluation of the persistent limitations and challenges of APXPS, as well as the current experimental frontiers.

A new concept of universal substitutive explosive welding
Abstract:
This paper presents an innovative explosive welding technology, namely Universal Substitutive Explosive Welding technique, which was recently developed by Australian Defence Science and Technology Group to improve the survivability and mobility of military vehicles. The new technique is superior to the existing industrial explosive welding ones in terms of integrity, quality and stability. It is able to significantly upgrade the hardness upper limit of target material and ensure the perfect welding bond between the flyer (soft) and target (hard) panels without size limitation of target panel. Experimental results show that using the new technique raised the ballistic velocity limit (V-50) of the explosively welded panel by up to 20% and reduced the bulge depth (related to dynamic plasticity) significantly without any rupture or fragmentation issues. Charpy impact test on the sample fabricated by the new technique showed strong recovery effects with time with no transition temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: 
Colloidal assembly of magnetic nanoparticles and polyelectrolytes by arrested electrostatic interaction
Abstract:
Electrostatic interaction of charged colloids and polyelectrolytes is a useful method to assemble matter into hybrid nanostructures with numerous examples in materials science as well as in biology. However, the colloidal electrostatic interaction is rapid and uncontrolled, the strong interaction usually leads to large and irregular aggregates. Therefore, control of the electrostatic interaction in order to resulting well-defined nanostructures remains a challenge. Here we report on a general and simple method to moderate the wild electrostatic interaction. Direct mixing of stock solutions containing anionic superparamagnetic nanoparticles and widespread cationic homopolyelectrolytes at an appropriate ionic strength generates aggregates with controlled shape and morphology. The simple and versatile methodology not only efficiently moderates electrostatic interactions but also enables the corresponding growth mechanism to be revealed by light scattering and electron microscopy as aggregation occurs at much slower timescales. The present results carry important implications for both practical applications and understanding on nanoscale electrostatic interaction between colloids. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The 2017 terahertz science and technology roadmap
Abstract:
Science and technologies based on terahertz frequency electromagnetic radiation (100 GHz-30 THz) have developed rapidly over the last 30 years. For most of the 20th Century, terahertz radiation, then referred to as sub-millimeter wave or far-infrared radiation, was mainly utilized by astronomers and some spectroscopists. Following the development of laser based terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in the 1980s and 1990s the field of THz science and technology expanded rapidly, to the extent that it now touches many areas from fundamental science to 'real world' applications. For example THz radiation is being used to optimize materials for new solar cells, and may also be a key technology for the next generation of airport security scanners. While the field was emerging it was possible to keep track of all new developments, however now the field has grown so much that it is increasingly difficult to follow the diverse range of new discoveries and applications that are appearing. At this point in time, when the field of THz science and technology is moving from an emerging to a more established and interdisciplinary field, it is apt to present a roadmap to help identify the breadth and future directions of the field. The aim of this roadmap is to present a snapshot of the present state of THz science and technology in 2017, and provide an opinion on the challenges and opportunities that the future holds. To be able to achieve this aim, we have invited a group of international experts to write 18 sections that cover most of the key areas of THz science and technology. We hope that The 2017 Roadmap on THz science and technology will prove to be a useful resource by providing a wide ranging introduction to the capabilities of THz radiation for those outside or just entering the field as well as providing perspective and breadth for those who are well established. We also feel that this review should serve as a useful guide for government and funding agencies.

Title: 
Researcher and institutional review board perspectives on the benefits and challenges of reporting back biomonitoring and environmental exposure results
Abstract:
As the number of personal exposure studies expands and trends favor greater openness and transparency in the health sciences, ethical issues arise around reporting back individual results for contaminants without clear health guidelines. Past research demonstrates that research participants want their results even when the health implications are not known. The experiences of researchers and institutional review boards (IRBs) in studies that have reported personal chemical exposures can provide insights about ethical and practical approaches while also revealing areas of continued uncertainty. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 researchers and nine IRB members from seven personal exposure studies across the United States to investigate their experiences and attitudes about the report-back process. Researchers reported multiple benefits of report back, including increasing retention and recruitment, advancing environmental health literacy, empowering study participants to take actions to reduce exposures, encouraging shifts in government and industry practices, and helping researchers discover sources of exposure through participant consultation. Researchers also reported challenges, including maintaining ongoing contact with participants, adopting protocols for notification of high exposures to chemicals without health guidelines, developing meaningful report-back materials, and resource limitations. IRB members reported concern for potential harm to participants, such as anxiety about personal results and counterproductive behavior changes. In contrast, researchers who have conducted personal report-back in their studies said that participants did not appear overly alarmed and noted that worry can be a positive outcome to motivate action to reduce harmful exposures. While key concerns raised during the early days of report-back have been substantially resolved for scientists with report-back experience, areas of uncertainty remain. These include ethical tensions surrounding the responsibility of researchers to leverage study results and resources to assist participants in policy or community-level actions to reduce chemical exposures, and how to navigate report-back to vulnerable populations.

Title: 
On the Incompressibility of Cylindrical Origami Patterns
Abstract:
The art and science of folding intricate three-dimensional structures out of paper has occupied artists, designers, engineers, and mathematicians for decades, culminating in the design of deployable structures and mechanical metamaterials. Here we investigate the axial compressibility of origami cylinders, i.e., cylindrical structures folded from rectangular sheets of paper. We prove, using geometric arguments, that a general fold pattern only allows for a finite number of isometric cylindrical embeddings. Therefore, compressibility of such structures requires either stretching the material or deforming the folds. Our result considerably restricts the space of constructions that must be searched when designing new types of origami-based rigid-foldable deployable structures and metamaterials.
