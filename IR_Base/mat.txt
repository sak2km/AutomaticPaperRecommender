Elastic and Inelastic Light-Matter Interactions in 2D Materials
Abstract:
Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides and phosphorene have emerged as brand new photonic materials with huge potential in a variety of optical applications in recent years, due to their unique properties and multiple functions. Owning to the significantly increased surface to volume ratio in the atomic thin layered structure, the interactions between 2D materials with light become remarkably strong in either elastic or inelastic interactions. Most of previous studies were focused on the inelastic interactions between 2D materials with light, namely Raman and photoluminescence properties. However, we found the elastic interactions between them and light are also very attractive. Based on the properties discovered, we demonstrated several optical applications, such as atomically thin optical lenses and gratings. On the other hand, we found the inelastic interactions with light in the 2D limitation affected a lot by the external environment, which could serve as a unique method to control the working status of the optical devices to meet multiple application needs. Several progresses were demonstrated such as control of excitons and trions in few-layer MoS2 via the co-modulations by both temperature and electric field and the defect engineering by oxygen plasma etching to stimulate new photon emission.

Computational Modelling on Heat Transfer Study of Molten Silicon During Multi-crystalline Silicon Growth Process for PV Applications
Abstract:
Multi-crystalline silicon is an important material with advantages of low-production cost and high conversion efficiency for photovoltaic solar cells. Directional solidifi cation has become the main technique for producing mc-Si ingots for solar cell applications. The study is performed in the framework of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in the Boussinesq approximation with convection-conduction equations. The computations are carried out in a two dimensional (2D) axisymmetric model by the finite- element method. The influence of the Reynolds numbers, total heat flux and velocity streamline pattern on the silicon melt was simulated and analyzed for various Rayleigh numbers between 10 to 10 (6) with the help of a numerical technique. The following key findings are presented in this paper. The velocity field value is increased above 0.02(m/s), heat flux value is increased to 10 (4)(W/m (2)), when the Rayleigh number is increased above 1000. Reynolds numbers are also studied in five parallel horizontal cross-sections of the melt silicon region for various Prandtl numbers at a critical Rayleigh number of 1000. Reynolds numbers are varied between 100 and 10 (5) for the Rayleigh numbers between 10 to 10 (6). Meanwhile, the melt has high fluctuation when the Prandtl number is increased above 0.01. The flow is converted from laminar to turbulence at a critical Rayleigh number 1000 and Prandtl number 0.01. These results provide important information for controlling the melt fluctuations during the solidification process which are used to increase the average grain size in growing silicon multicrystals and reduce the dislocation density.

Assessment of key features of lignin from lignocellulosic crops: Stalks and roots of corn, cotton, sugarcane, and tobacco
Abstract:
Lignins from industrial crops could be converted into valuable chemicals in the context of a second generation biorefinery, but prior understanding of their structure is required. This work is focused on the characterization of lignins from stalks and roots of corn, cotton, sugarcane and tobacco. Lignin structure was studied through nitrobenzene oxidation, C-13, P-31, and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Lignins were isolated by mild acidolysis with a maximum degree of contamination of 10% (carbohydrates plus ashes). Interpretation and quantification of NMR spectra provided consistent data about typical units and structures, such as syringyl:guaiacyl:p-hydroxyphenyl (S:G:H), frequency of beta-aryl ether linkages (beta-O-4) and non-condensed structures (NCS), total hydroxyl phenolic groups and their distribution on different non-condensed units type, and the presence of p-coumaric and ferulic acids. In general, roots lignin contains fewer beta-O-4 and lower S/G ratio than the respective stalks, while NCS content does not follow a perceptible trend. In spite of the similarity between corn and sugarcane lignins, radar plots promptly demonstrate higher differences between species than between morphological parts, confirming the lignin specificity of each species. These results are discussed in a comparative approach, highlighting for each material the characteristic features of its lignin. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

2D and bulk h-MgSe materials from MgmSen (m, n=1-3) clusters: Density functional investigation
Abstract:
An investigation in detail on the structure, electronic and thermodynamic properties for a series of group II and VI Combined hybrid alloy clusters, viz, MgmSen (m,n = 1-3) is performed, under density functional theory (DFT). The geometries of all clusters has been optimized by employing a very popular and reliable exchange-correlation functional, viz, Becke's 3 parameter exchange with Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional (B3LYP). The influence of adding of group II and/or group VI elements on the electronic properties is also addressed in the present work. A sincere effort has been tendered to identify any potential cluster motif from the considered series for utilizing as the building block for prospective metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) materials at the bulk scale. Accordingly, with an achievement of exceptionally stable rhombus shaped and D-2h symmetric Mg2Se2, we have investigated structure and electronic properties of 2D hexagonal magnesium selenide (2D h-MgSe) as well as hexagonal magnesium selenide at bulk scale (bulk h-MgSe). It is evident from the present study that although 2D planar h-MgSe reveals as an insulator with the direct band gap 4.20 eV whereas bulk h-MgSe come out to be a semiconductor material with direct band gap as 1.13 eV. The bulk h-MgSe phase is reported to be an exceptionally stable semiconductor in the magnesium selenide family. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: 
Surface properties of a single perfluoroalkyl group on water surfaces studied by surface potential measurements
Abstract:
A discriminative study of a single perfluoroalkyl (Rf) group from a bulk material is recently recognized to be necessary toward the total understanding of Rf compounds based on a primary chemical structure. The single molecule and the bulk matter have an interrelationship via an intrinsic two-dimensional (2D) aggregation property of an Rf group, which is theorized by the stratified dipole-arrays (SDA) theory. Since an Rf group has dipole moments along many C-F bonds, a single Rf group would possess a hydrophilic-like character on the surface. To reveal the hydration character of a single Rf group, in the present study, surface potential (Delta V) measurements are performed for Langmuir monolayers of Rf-containing compounds. From a comparative study with a monolayer of a normal hydrocarbon compound, the hydration/dehydration dynamics of a lying Rf group on water has first been monitored by Delta V measurements, through which a single Rf group has been revealed to have a unique "dipole-inter active" character, which enables the Rf group interacted with the water 'surface.' In addition, the SDA theory proves to be useful to predict the 2D aggregation property across the phase transition temperature of 19 degrees C by use of the AV measurements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title: 
Proteomic profile of mouse fibroblasts exposed to pure magnesium extract
Abstract:
Magnesium and its alloys gain wide attention as degradable biomaterials. In order to reveal the molecular mechanism of the influence of biodegradable magnesium on cells, proteomics analysis was performed in this work. After mouse fibroblasts (L929) were cultured with or without Mg degradation products (Mg-extract) for 8, 24, and 48 h, changes inprotein expression profiles were obtained using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) coupled two dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC MS/MS). A total of 867 proteins were identified (relying on at least two peptides). Compared to the control group, 205, 282, and 217 regulated proteins were identified at 8, 24, and 48 h, respectively. 65 common proteins were up or down-regulated within all the three time points, which were involved in various physiological and metabolic activities. Consistent with viability, proliferation, and cell cycle analysis, stimulated energy metabolism as well as protein synthesis pathways were discussed, indicating a possible effect of Mg-extract on L929 proliferation. Furthermore, endocytosis and focal adhesion processes were also discussed. This proteomics study uncovers early cellular mechanisms triggered by Mg degradation products and highlights the cytocompatibility of biodegradable metallic materials for biomedical applications such as stents or orthopaedic implants.

Title: 
Fission yields and cross section uncertainty propagation in Boltzmann/Bateman coupled problems: Global and local parameters analysis with a focus on MTR
Abstract:
In a previous paper, a method was investigated to calculate sensitivity coefficients in coupled Boltzmann/Bateman problem for nuclear data (ND) uncertainties propagation on the reactivity. Different methodologies were discussed and applied on an actual example of multigroup cross section uncertainty problem for a 2D Material Testing Reactor (MTR) benchmark. It was shown that differences between methods arose from correlations between input parameters, as far as the method enables to take them into account. Those methods, unlike Monte Carlo (MC) sampling for uncertainty propagation and quantification (UQ), allow obtaining sensitivity coefficients, as well as correlations values between nuclear data, during the depletion calculation for the parameters of interest. This work is here extended to local parameters such as power factors and isotopic concentrations. It also includes fission yield (FY) uncertainty propagation, on both reactivity and power factors. Furthermore, it introduces a new methodology enabling to decorrelate direct and transmutation terms for local quantities: a Monte-Carlo method using built samples from a multidimensional Gaussian law is used to extend the previous studies, and propagate fission yield uncertainties from the CEA's COMAC covariance file. It is shown that, for power factors, the most impacting ND are the scattering reactions, principally coming from Al-27 and (bounded hydrogen in) H2O. The overall effect is a reduction of the propagated uncertainties throughout the cycle thanks to negatively correlated terms. For fission yield (FY), the results show that neither reactivity nor local power factors are strongly affected by uncertainties. However, they have a non-negligible impact on some isotopic concentrations, and can lead to biases on some burnup indicators. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent progress in 2D or 3D N-doped graphene synthesis and the characterizations, properties, and modulations of N species
Abstract:
Nitrogen (N)-doped graphene (N-substituted or nitrogenated graphene) (NG) has become a new class of graphene material due to its modified properties such as the tunable work function, n-type semiconductivity, increasing biocompatibility, and, in particular, the synergistic function with various functional materials. However, the preparation of NG by a simple and effective method is still lacking. The modification of NG mainly depends on the N species and the N content. Thus, we focus on the recent progress in preparing methods of 2D NG and the respective key modulating parameters to modulate the N species and the N content. Furthermore, many effective charactering techniques are covered to accurately analyze the properties of N species, and the distribution and topography of N atoms. Also, we review the effect of N species on graphene, especially, the optical and electronic properties. Since constructing 3D structure is considered a promising strategy to prevent the restacking of 2D NG, the summary for preparing 3D NG is made on the basis of methodology of 2D NG. In a word, this review provides a reference for preparing 2D or 3D NG, modulating and characterizing N species, which are greatly contributed to the NG application.

Title: 
Flow control through the use of heterogeneous porous media: "Smart" passive thermo-insulating materials
Abstract:
In this paper, the concept of "smart" thermally insulating materials intelligently adapted to specific engineering configurations is established and extensively validated. Thermal insulation is achieved by local suppression of the momentum of the confined natural convection flow in the most critical regions, as determined by a linear stability analysis of the flow in the presence of implants of heterogeneous porous media. The implants are modelled by unconnected packed beds of equi-sized cylinders. The concept is based on a mesoscale approach in which the non-slip boundary conditions in the vicinity of the packed beds are explicitly imposed by utilizing the immersed boundary (IB) method. Two different patterns for the "smart" porous media are established, and their thermal insulation properties are quantified. It is shown that the optimized patterns for implants of heterogeneous porous media, occupying approximately only 5% of the overall volume, can drastically delay the steady-unsteady transition of the 2D natural convection flow in a square differentially heated cavity with thermally perfectly conducting horizontal walls. In addition, it is demonstrated that the implants facilitate a consistent decrease in the heat flux through a cubic differentially heated cavity with all being thermally perfectly conducting lateral walls.

Title: 
Fractionation of wheat straw Dioxane lignin reveals molar mass dependent structural differences
Abstract:
Dioxane lignin was isolated from ball-milled wheat straw by neutral dioxane-water extraction and subsequently molar-mass-fractionated by flash chromatography in dimethylformamide. The eluted lignin containing material was pooled into six distinct molar mass fractions that were in turn structurally characterized in detail by wet chemistry and NMR spectroscopy methods. Fractions of higher molar mass were found to be enriched in p-hydroxyphenyl units and contained more p-hydroxycinnamic acid units. They were found mainly associated with linear arabinoxylan, while in low-molar-mass fractions additional glucan contributions were found. Fractions of lower molar mass consisted of relatively more guaiacyl units and showed exclusive association with tricin units. One distinct lignin fraction with lower lignin content supposedly contained high ratios of arabinoxylan chains esterified by ferulic acid and cross-linked via ferulic acid dimerization, structures which were considered to represent lignin nucleation sites. High abundance of dibenzodioxocin type structures in this fraction indicated that they could be involved in cross-linking hemicelluloses networks with lignin moieties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Self-assembled flower-like NiFe2O4 decorated on 2D graphene nanosheets composite and their excellent electrochemical performance as anode materials for LIBs
Abstract:
Flower-like NiFe2O4 decorated on 2D graphene nanosheets composite and spherical NiFe2O4 decorated on 2D graphene nanosheets composite have been synthesized through an easy method including one-pot hydrothermal route and one-pot heat treatment, respectively. In the well-designed 3D dimensional system, 2D graphene nanosheets work as conductive matrix to support the flower-like NiFe2O4 and spherical NiFe2O4. The structure integrates the advantage of graphene nanosheets to preserve the electrode activity and integrity, improving the electrochemical performance. Lithium storage properties of the two kind of composites are compared as anode materials. The results presented that flower-like NiFe2O4/graphene composite shows better electrochemical performance and cycling stability. The first discharge capacity is 2632.6 mA h/g at a high current density of 100 mA/g. After 50 cycles, the reversible capacity is 606.2 mA h/g and the coulomb efficiency reaches at 98.86%. With the excellent electrochemical properties, flower-like NiFe2O4 decorated on 2D graphene nanosheets could be a kind of promising potential candidate anode materials for LIBs. This research offers possibility to improve the lithium ion storage capacity of transition metal oxides through advisablely controlling the architecture and composition of anode materials.

Epitaxial growth of Bi2Te3 topological insulator thin films by temperature-gradient induced physical vapor deposition (PVD)
Abstract:
We report the growth of a high-quality Bi2Te3 thin film on an Al2O3 substrate using physical vapor deposition. Using a carefully selected temperature gradient between two separately controllable heaters inside a furnace, an unstrained Bi2Te3 thin film with c-axis orientation and domains bonded by van der Waals epitaxy is formed, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The stoichiometry of the film determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that the film has only slight surface oxidation and few contaminants, and the estimated ratio of the atomic densities of bismuth and tellurium is 1.49. A relatively low carrier concentration of 4.83 x 10(18) cm(-3) and electron mobility of 192.4 cm(2)/Vs at 3 K allow clear observation of the weak anti-localization effect. Using a traditional two-dimensional (2D) localization analysis with the original Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka equation, we find clear evidence for the existence of topological surface states, and the temperature dependence of the phase coherence length exhibits 2D material behavior. Pronounced linear magnetoresistance at medium and high fields, which shows the interplay between three characteristic lengths, is also analyzed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Microscopic and mechanical properties of semi-crystalline and amorphous polymeric parts produced by laser cutting
Abstract:
Microscopic and mechanical properties of polymeric parts are effective factors on their durability. Laser cutting is one of the most common methods for production of 2D polymeric parts. Experimental study of the mentioned properties of semi-crystalline and amorphous polymeric parts after laser cutting is conducted in this research. Low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polystyrene (PS) are considered as semi-crystalline and amorphous polymers, respectively. Laser power and cutting velocity were selected as input parameters of cutting process. According to microscopic observations, the microcracks, re-solidified spots of molten material, and sink marks just appear in heat affected zone (HAZ) on amorphous polymer. Results also showed that the HAZ width and surface roughness values are smaller for semi-crystalline polymer. For both polymers, decreasing of power and increasing of cutting velocity reduce the HAZ and surface roughness. In the case of mechanical properties, tensile strength of semi-crystalline and amorphous polymers reduces after laser cutting. Results of experiments revealed that the extension of HAZ and deterioration of surface finish decrease tensile strength of parts. Therefore, lower power and higher cutting velocity condition is preferable for reaching the better mechanical properties. Furthermore, two separate mathematical models for each polymer are presented for prediction of tensile strength after laser cutting process. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title: 
Lattice percolation approach to 3D modeling of tissue aging
Abstract:
We describe a 3D percolation-type approach to modeling of the processes of aging and certain other properties of tissues analyzed as systems consisting of interacting cells. Lattice sites are designated as regular (healthy) cells, senescent cells, or vacancies left by dead (apoptotic) cells. The system is then studied dynamically with the ongoing processes including regular cell dividing to fill vacant sites, healthy cells becoming senescent or dying, and senescent cells dying. Statistical-mechanics description can provide patterns of time dependence and snapshots of morphological system properties. The developed theoretical modeling approach is found not only to corroborate recent experimental findings that inhibition of senescence can lead to extended lifespan, but also to confirm that, unlike 2D, in 3D senescent cells can contribute to tissue's connectivity/mechanical stability. The latter effect occurs by senescent cells forming the second infinite cluster in the regime when the regular (healthy) cell's infinite cluster still exists. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title: 
Examination of Berkovich indenter tip bluntness
Abstract:
Actual shape of the indenter is very important parameter affecting the results and interpretation of nanoindentation tests. In this study, bluntness of the tip was determined by direct (atomic force microscopy) and indirect methods (indentation into reference materials) for different states of the indenter over its lifetime. It was found that the equivalent radius depends on the used analysis method. Moreover, equivalent radius changes with the distance from indenter apex. Axisymmetric 2D sphero-conical and 3D finite element models of the indenter geometry were used to predict force-displacement curves which were compared with experiment. It was shown, that there exists a significant difference between 2D and 3D models caused by the simplifications of actual 3D shape of Berkovich indenter by sphero-conical model. The sphero-conical model can serve as good estimator of indenter bluntness and it is convenient for the description of the indenter wear throughout its lifetime. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Facile synthesis of two-dimensional WS2 with reverse saturable absorption and nonlinear refraction properties in the PMMA matrix
Abstract:
We report a versatile, cost-effective and reproducible solid-state reaction approach to synthesize two-dimensional (2D) WS2 with strong nonlinear optical performances. The reverse saturable absorption and nonlinear refraction properties of 2D WS2 incorporated into PMMA were measured by the z-scan configuration under femtosecond pulses at 800 nm. The figure of merit and the nonlinear optical refractive index n(2) were calculated to be similar to 0.40 x 10(-13) esu cm and similar to 3.34 x 10(-4) cm(2)/GW, respectively. Furthermore, optical limiting (OL) effects of the WS2/PMMA composite were observed with OL threshold FOL similar to 2.4 mJ/cm(2), which is lower than those of previously reported OL materials. Such results imply the WS2/PMMA composite as a potential candidate for practical OL applications and the solid- state reaction technology provides a feasible approach for the preparation of 2D WS2 applied in the field of nanophotonics.

Title: 
Rose flower-like NiCo2O4 with hierarchically porous structures for highly reversible lithium storage
Abstract:
Hybrid nanostructured transition metal oxides have attracted great attention as high-performance electrode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. In this work, novel porous NiCo2O4 nanoparticles are synthesized by a solvothermal method using poly (vinylpyrolidone) (PVP) as the structure-directing agent followed by a simple thermal annealing treatment. Through the XRD, FESEM, TEM, and N-2 sorption analyses, it has been found that the as-prepared NiCo2O4 nanoparticles show hierarchical rose flower-like architecture constituted by 2D hierarchically porous nanosheets. The 2D porous nanosheets provide sufficient void space generated during thermal annealing treatment, benefiting electrolyte penetration and fast electron transfer. The porous structure also can tolerate the volume variation upon prolonged charge/discharge cycling. Therefore, when the as-prepared NiCo2O4 nanoparticles are used as anode materials for the Li-ion batteries, they exhibit high capacity, remarkable capacity retention at increased current densities, and outstanding cycling stability.

Superconductivity of metal-induced surface reconstructions on silicon
Abstract:
Recent progress in superconducting metal-induced surface reconstructions on silicon is reviewed, mainly focusing on the results of the author's group. After a brief introduction of an ultrahigh-vacuum(UHV)low-temperature (LT)-compatible electron transport measurement system, direct observation of the zero resistance state for the Si(111)(root 7 x root 3)-In surface is described, which demonstrates the existence of a superconducting transition in this class of two-dimensional (2D) materials. The measurement and analysis of the temperature dependence of the critical current density indicate that a surface atomic step works as a Josephson junction. This identification is further confirmed by LT-scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) observation of Josephson vortices trapped at atomic steps on the Si(111)(root 7 x root 3)-In surface. These experiments reveal unique features of metal-induced surface reconstructions on silicon that may be utilized to explore novel superconductivity.

Thermographic and tomographic methods for tridimensional characterization of thermal transfer in silica/phenolic composites
Abstract:
Silica/phenolic composite materials are often used in thermal protection systems (TPS) for atmospheric re-entry. The present work aims to compare two different approaches to assess heat transfer properties of these materials: i) using standard and specific experimental methods, and ii) with the development of 3D thermal transfer multiscale model using 2D (microscopy) and 3D (tomography) images. The latter procedure, based on computations on images, is a two-step change of scale from microscopic scale to mesoscopic scale and then to the macroscopic one. Two silica/phenolic composites with different spatial organizations are studied and their thermal properties are compared. Several experimental methods have been used, including space-resolved diffusivity determinations. Numerical results are compared to experimental ones in terms of transverse and longitudinal thermal conductivities of the composites, and were found to be in good agreement. A discussion is made on the different possible sources of uncertainty for both methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Lattice dynamics and electronic structures of Ti3C2O2 and Mo2TiC2O2 (MXenes): The effect of Mo substitution
Abstract:
Recently, Mo2TiC2, an ordered two transition metals MXene has been synthesized, which offers a great opportunity to explore the effect of transition metal in MXenes. Here, the structure, dynamical and electronic properties of Mo2TiC2O2 and Ti3C2O2 are compared to investigate the effect of Mo substitution. Our density functional calculations predict that Mo2TiC2O2 prefer different structural configuration than the well-known Ti3C2O2. By comparing the dynamics and electronic structure between Mo2TiC2O2 and Ti3C2O2, we found that the replacement of Ti with Mo could enhance the chemical bonding and the electronic coupling of oxygen and carbon with metals. In addition, the GGA calculations show that Mo could change metallic Ti3C2O2 into semiconducting Mo2TiC2O2, which agrees with the recently experimental observation. Our calculations also show that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect is important to the electronic band structure of Mo2TiC2O2. The SOC could split the degenerate d bands on the Fermi level and the band inversion that is significant to the nontrivial band topology is found in Mo2TiC2O2. Our results indicate that Mo2TiC2O2 may be a two-dimensional topological (2D TI) semiconductor with band gap (HSE06 + SOC) of 0.17 eV. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Large magnetoresistance in planar Fe/MoS2/Fe tunnel junction
Abstract:
We report a large magnetoresistance observed in a Fe/MoS2/Fe tunnel junction, where iron electrodes are attached to the edges of MoS2 nanoribbon (i.e. the current is flowing in the plane of the MoS2 2D mono layer). Using non-equilibrium Green's functions in the framework of density functional approach, our calculations show a large magnetoresistance in Fe/MoS2/Fe junction, with the values up to 150%. The strong coupling between states of Mo atoms at the edge of the MoS2 monolayer and those at the Fe surface have a dramatic effect on the conductance property of the material as well as the MR of the Fe/MoS2/Fe tunnel junction. We conclude that the Fe electrodes polarize the spin states of MoS2 near the interface and efficiently inject carriers into MoS2. We find that the atomically-thin spacers are metallic due to a strong hybridization between the Fe and Mo states at the interface. MoS2 spacers of a larger width remain insulating. We also find that the magnetoresistance of thin MoS2 ribbons (three atomic layers wide) is negative and has a small value. Notably however, as the width of the MoS2 spacer increases, this value turns positive and increases in magnitude. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Photoswitching in nanostructured benzofuro[3,2-b]pyridin-9-ol and benzothio[3,2-b] pyridin-9-ol compounds as red- and yellow-light-emitting molecules: A TD-DFT approach
Abstract:
In this work, intramolecular photo-induced proton transfer in Benzofuro[3,2-b]pyridin-9-ol (BFPO) and Benzothio[3,2-b] pyridin-9-ol (BTPO) were investigated using TD-DFT method at PBEO/6-311++G(2d,2p) and M06-2X/6-311++G(2d,2p) levels of theory. Both molecules are able to render both normal and tautomer emissions and exhibit the large Stokes-shifted fluorescence in gas and solvent media. The potential energy surfaces at ground and excited states, structural parameters, H-bonding energy, absorption and emission bands, vertical excitation and emission energies, oscillator strength, fluorescence rate constant, dipole moment, atomic charges and electron density at critical points were calculated. The effect of solvent media on electronics transition energies and absorption as well as florescence spectra are presented. The potential of these molecules as emissive materials in designing and generation of new displays and light sources were predicted based on their high Stokes shifts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A cobalt (II) complex with 6-methylpicolinate: Synthesis, characterization, second- and third-order nonlinear optical properties, and DFT calculations
Abstract:
A cobalt(II) complex of 6-methylpicolinic acid, [Co(6-Mepic)(2)(H2O)(2)]center dot 2H(2)O, was prepared and fully determined by single crystal X-ray crystal structure analysis as well as FT-IR, FT-Raman. UV-vis spectra were recorded within different solvents, to illustrate electronic transitions and molecular charge transfer within complex 1. The coordination sphere of complex 1 is a distorted octahedron according to single crystal X-ray results. Moreover, DFT (density functional theory) calculations with HSEH1PBE/6-311 G(d,p) level were carried out to back up the experimental results, and form base for future work in advanced level. Hyperconjugative interactions, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), molecular stability and bond strength were researched by the using natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. X-ray and NBO analysis results demonsrate that O-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds between the water molecules and carboxylate oxygen atoms form a 2D supramolecular network, and also adjacent 2D networks connected by C-H center dot center dot center dot pi and pi center dot center dot center dot pi interactions to form a 3D supramolecular network. Additionally, the second- and third-order nonlinear optical parameters of complex 1 were computed at DFT/FISEH1PBE/6-311 G(d,p) level. The refractive index (n) was calculated by using the Lorentz-Lorenz equation in order to investigate polarization behavior of complex 1 in different solvent polarities. The first-order static hyperpolarizability ((3) value is found to be lower than pNA value because of the inversion symmetry around Co (II). But the second-order static hyperpolarizability (gamma) value is 2.45 times greater than pNA value (15 x 10(-30) esu). According to these results, Co(II) complex can be considered as a candidate to NLO material. Lastly molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), frontier molecular orbital energies and related molecular parameters for complex 1 were evaluated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mechanics analysis on the composite flywheel stacked from circular twill woven fabric rings
Abstract:
The filament wound composite flywheel had a deficiency of being fragile along the radial direction because there is no reinforcing phase distribution. The failure along the radial direction due to delamination may happen when the thick cylinder composite flywheel rotate at high speed. A new way to solve the low radial strength problem of the composite flywheel is to use woven fabric material. The 2D woven fabric composite in the form of a circular ring has fibers in both the circumferential and radial directions to bear the stress. This structure features the combination of the typical two-dimensional orthogonal textile fabric and the classic axial laminations, performing new characters in mechanics. Samples of composite disks with 2D woven fabric material were designed and fabricated for spinning test, and the mechanics analysis on the thin woven composite disk was carried out for the first time. With the introduction of micromechanics methods, the elastic constants of the unit cell model of periodic volume representing the whole fabric were extracted from geometrical simplification and homogenization theories. The stiffness and strength of orthogonal twill woven fabric were predicted to evaluate the failure spinning speed of the fabric composite disks. The theoretical maximum spin speed of the woven flywheel could reach 1261 rps with energy density of 53 W h/kg. The tension test data on samples of twill woven fabric composite helped with the prediction of failure of disk samples. The spinning tests confirmed that the tail weakness of the stacked configuration and the stiffness degradation from defects in composite contributed greatly to the stable running of flywheel spin.

A hybrid Boundary Element Unstructured Transmission-line (BEUT) method for accurate 2D electromagnetic simulation
Abstract:
Time domain electromagnetic simulation tools have the ability to model transient, wide-band applications, and non-linear problems. The Boundary Element Method (BEM) and the Transmission Line Modeling (TLM) method are both well established numerical techniques for simulating time-varying electromagnetic fields. The former surface based method can accurately describe outwardly radiating fields from piecewise uniform objects and efficiently deals with large domains filled with homogeneous media. The latter volume based method can describe inhomogeneous and non-linear media and has been proven to be unconditionally stable. Furthermore, the Unstructured TLM (UTLM) enables modelling of of geometrically complex objects by using triangular meshes which removes staircasing and unnecessary extensions of the simulation domain. The hybridization of BEM and UTLM which is described in this paper is named the Boundary Element Unstructured Transmission-line (BEUT) method. It incorporates the advantages of both methods. The theory and derivation of the 2D BEUT method is described in this paper, along with any relevant implementation details. The method is corroborated by studying its correctness and efficiency compared to the traditional UTLM method when applied to complex problems such as the transmission through a system of Luneburg lenses and the modelling of antenna radomes for use in wireless communications.

Title: 
The effects of rock fragment shapes and positions on modeled hydraulic conductivities of stony soils
Abstract:
Mountainous soils usually contain a large number of rock fragments, particles with a diameter larger than 2 mm, which can influence soil hydraulic properties that are required to quantitatively describe soil water movement in stony soils. The objective of this study was to numerically estimate both the saturated hydraulic conductivity of a stony soil and its dependence on a relative content of rock fragments (stoniness), and the shape, position and distribution of rock fragments in a soil matrix. The assessment method was based on a numerical version of Darcy's classic experiment that involved steady-state flow through a porous material under a unit hydraulic gradient. Our experiments, involving hypothetical stony soils in this particular case, were simulated using mainly the two-dimensional (2D) numerical model, HYDRUS-2D. A limited number of simulations were carried out using a three-dimensional HYDRUS model. Three different shapes of hypothetical rock fragments were used in the study: a sphere, an ellipsoid with two different positions, and a pyramid, all represented by their 2D cross-sections (i.e., a circle, an ellipse, and a triangle, respectively). The mean relative effective saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-rs) for the same stoniness was almost the same for all simulated scenarios and fine soil textures. A stoniness between 0.07 and 0.5 cm(3) cm(-3) can cause a decrease of K-rs in the range of 0.17-0.70. Numerical experiments were divided into 3 scenarios. The largest and the smallest values of were different for different shapes of RFs (scenario A), different orientations of the slab-sided elliptical RFs (scenario B), and regular or irregular distributions of spherical RFs (scenario C). The largest difference between K-rs values (0.26) was found in scenario B when the slab-sided elliptical RFs were oriented either horizontally or vertically for stoniness of 0.24 or 0.31 cm(3) cm(-3). Simulated K-rs values were underestimated in all scenarios as compared to the Ravina and Magier (1984) function. The smallest differences (-1.1%-2.5%) between numerically simulated and calculated (the Corring and Churchill (1961) method for a cylindrical shape of RFs) K-rs values were found for scenario A with its 2D representation of spherical rock fragments. Calculated (the Corring and Churchill (1961) method for a spherical shape of RFs) K-rs values corresponded well with those simulated using a 3D representation of spherical rock fragments. Numerical models provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of different factors on the saturated hydraulic conductivity of stony soils that may be nearly impossible to measure in practice.

Title: 
Mid-infrared mapping of Jupiter's temperatures, aerosol opacity and chemical distributions with IRTF/TEXES
Abstract:
Global maps of Jupiter's atmospheric temperatures, gaseous composition and aerosol opacity are derived from a programme of 5-20 mu m mid-infrared spectroscopic observations using the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES) on NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). Image cubes from December 2014 in eight spectral channels, with spectral resolutions of R similar to'2000-12, 000 and spatial resolutions of 2-4 degrees latitude, are inverted to generate 3D maps of tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures, 2D maps of upper tropospheric aerosols, phosphine and ammonia, and 2D maps of stratospheric ethane and acetylene. The results are compared to a re-analysis of Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) observations acquired during Cassini's closest approach to Jupiter in December 2000, demonstrating that this new archive of ground-based mapping spectroscopy can match and surpass the quality of previous investigations, and will permit future studies of Jupiter's evolving atmosphere. The visibility of cool zones and warm belts varies from channel to channel, suggesting complex vertical variations from the radiatively-controlled upper troposphere to the convective mid -troposphere. We identify mid-infrared signatures of Jupiter's 5-mu m hotspots via simultaneous M, N and Q-band observations, which are interpreted as temperature and ammonia variations in the northern Equatorial Zone and on the edge of the North Equatorial Belt (NEB). Equatorial plumes enriched in NH3 gas are located south-east of NH3-desiccated 'hotspots' on the edge of the NEB. Comparison of the hotspot locations in several channels across the 5-20 mu m range indicate that these anomalous regions tilt westward with altitude. Aerosols and PH3 are both enriched at the equator but are not co-located with the NH3 plumes. The equatorial temperature minimum and PH3/aerosol maxima have varied in amplitude over time, possibly as a result of periodic equatorial brightenings and the fresh updrafts of disequilibrium material. Temperate mid-latitudes display a correlation between mid-IR aerosol opacity and the white albedo features in visible light (i.e., zones). We find hemispheric asymmetries in the distribution of tropospheric PH3, stratospheric hydrocarbons and the 2D wind field (estimated via the thermal-wind equation) that suggest a differing efficiency of mechanical forcing (e.g., vertical mixing and wave propagation) between the two hemispheres that we argue is driven by dynamics rather than Jupiter's small seasonal cycle. Jupiter's stratosphere is notably warmer at northern mid-latitudes than in the south in both 2000 and 2014, although the latter can be largely attributed to strong thermal wave activity near 30 degrees N that dominates the 2014 stratospheric maps and may be responsible for elevated C2H2 in the northern hemisphere. A vertically-variable pattern of temperature and wind shear minima and maxima associated with Jupiter's Quasi Quadrennial Oscillation (QQO) is observed at the equator in both datasets, although the contrasts were more subdued in 2014. Large-scale equator-to pole gradients in ethane and acetylene are superimposed on top of the mid-latitude mechanically-driven maxima, with C2H2 decreasing from equator to pole and C2H6 showing a polar enhancement, consistent with a radiatively-controlled circulation from low to high latitudes. Cold polar vortices beyond 60 latitude can be identified in the upper tropospheric and lower stratospheric temperature maps, suggesting enhanced radiative cooling from polar aerosols. Finally, compositional mapping of the Great Red Spot confirms the local enhancements in PH3 and aerosols, the north-south asymmetry in NH3 gas and the presence of a warm southern periphery that have been noted by previous authors.

Title: 
Few-layer thick WS2 nanosheets produced by intercalation/exfoliation route
Abstract:
Thin two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures of layered materials are of importance for both science and technology due to their unique properties and promising applications. Few-layer tungsten disulfide (WS2) presents some amazing optoelectronic behaviors that have attracted great interest. In this work, WS2 nanosheets with few-layer (< 10 layers) thickness have been successfully produced by Li ions intercalation/exfoliation of bulk WS2 via a solvothermal technique. X-ray diffraction indicates that hexagonal crystal structure of bulk WS2 remains the same after the intercalation/exfoliation treatment. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy characterizations reveal that the exfoliated products are single-crystalline thin nanosheets with high crystallinity. Atomic force microscopy reveals that 8-layer thick WS2 nanosheets can be fabricated by the present approach. Raman phonon modes of the prepared WS2 nanosheets present the redshifts due to their decreased thickness. The work provides a facile and affective route to high-quality WS2 thin 2D nanostructures that would have great potentials for optoelectronics.

Title: 
Synthesis of uniform monolayer graphene on re-solidified copper from waste chicken fat by low pressure chemical vapor deposition
Abstract:
A technology for converting waste materials to high quality large-area monolayer graphene film can be significant and thereby obtaining high value-added product. Here, we revealed the transformation of waste chicken fat into uniform monolayer graphene film on re-solidified Cu by a low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) technique. The evolve gas analyzer-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (EGA-GC-MS) analysis of chicken fat oil showed that the free fatty acid in chicken oil decomposed into a short hydrocarbon chains which makes it favorable to use as a carbon precursor for graphene synthesis. Growth of uniform monolayer graphene film on the re-solidified Cu was confirmed by Raman mapping, where 2D to G peak intensity ratio (I-2D/I-G) is 3.0 at most of the area. Thus, the use of waste from poultry industry as a carbon source instead of commonly used hydrocarbon gas sources for graphene synthesis can be an approach for green nanotechnology.

Title: 
Acoustic radiation force and spin torque on a viscoelastic cylinder in a quasi-Gaussian cylindrically-focused beam with arbitrary incidence in a non-viscous fluid
Abstract:
The axial and transverse acoustic radiation force components for a viscoelastic phenolic polymer circular cylinder placed arbitrarily in the field of a zeroth-order quasi-Gaussian focused beam in 2D are computed, based on the partial-wave series expansion (PWSE) method and Graf's addition theorem for the cylindrical wave functions to compute the off axial beam-shape coefficients. Moreover, the analysis is extended to derive the expression for the acoustic spin radiation torque experienced by the cylinder when the beam is shifted off-axially with respect to the axis of wave propagation. The emergence of the acoustic spin radiation torque experienced by the circular cylinder is a consequence of acoustic attenuation inside its absorptive material. Depending on the direction of the shift, the spin torque is negative or positive, causing the rotation of the cylinder in the polar plane in either the clockwise or the anticlockwise direction, respectively. Moreover, for a fixed position of the cylinder in the off-axial configuration, a spin torque reversal is predicted due to the variation of absorption of both the longitudinal and shear waves. The effect of increasing the surrounding fluid's density is also investigated, which has a substantial effect on the radiation force and spin torque plots. Numerical results are performed with particular emphasis on the properties of the incident beam, the amount of the shift from the center of the cylinder as well as the properties of the surrounding fluid. The analytical formalism allows evaluating the axial and transverse radiation force components and radiation torque for any 2D beam that is generally an exact solution of the Helmholtz equation. The sought applications are in controlled rotation of a particle and its manipulation using "acoustical sheets" (i.e., finite beams in 2D). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: 
Crystalline/Amorphous Si Integrated Optical Couplers for 2D/3D Interconnection
Abstract:
The in-plane and interlayer waveguide-type couplers between crystalline Si and amorphous-Si:H wire waveguides, for 2D/3D hybrid-material integration are presented in this paper. The in-plane-type coupler achieves stable coupling between two waveguides by using tapers located at the tips of the waveguides. The interlayer-type coupler can connect two waveguides, despite an interlayer distance of 1 mu m, with a simple process flow, by introducing a trident structure. An experiment was conducted in which the in-plane and interlayer-type couplers realized low coupling losses ( coupling efficiencies) of 0.16 dB ( 96%) and 0.49 dB ( 89%) per coupler, respectively.

Title: 
Optimization of pore structure and particle morphology of mesoporous silica for antibody adsorption for use in affinity chromatography
Abstract:
Antibodies have received significant attention for use as antibody drugs, because they bind the objective protein (antigen) via antigen-antibody reactions. Recently, many reports have appeared on various monoclonal antibodies that recognize a single antigen. In this study, monoclonal antibodies are used as adsorbates on mesoporous silica (MPS) for affinity chromatography. MPS has high surface area and large pore volume; moreover, pore diameter, pore structure, and particle morphology are relatively easy to tune by adjusting the conditions of synthesis. The pore structure (two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal and three-dimensional cubic) and particle morphology (spherical and polyhedral) of MPS are optimized for use in a monoclonal antibody/MPS composite. When anti-IgG (one of the monoclonal antibodies) adsorbs on the MPS material and IgG (antigen) binds to anti-IgG/MPS composites, MCM-41p with a 2D-hexagonal pore structure and polyhedral particle morphology has the highest IgG binding efficiency. In addition, the antibody/MPS composites remain stable in chaotropic and low-pH solutions and can be cycled at least five times without decreasing IgG elution. In purification and removal tests, the use of the antibody/MPS composites allows only the objective protein from protein mixtures to be bound and eluted. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: 
Highly sensitive and selective hydrogen gas sensor using sputtered grown Pd decorated MnO2 nanowalls
Abstract:
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted significant attention for device applications due to their unique structural, electronic and catalytic properties. Here, we have deposited a vertically aligned, highly ordered Pd decorated MnO2 nanowalls directly on a porous anodic alumina (AAO) by reactive sputtering and then it used as a gas sensor without additional processing. The nanowalls sensor shows remarkably high and selective responses to hydrogen gas with low detection range 10-10000 ppm. Our results demonstrate the potential application of Pd decorated MnO2 nanowalls for fabricating highly sensitive and selective gas sensors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title: 
Half-metallicity in 2D organometallic honeycomb frameworks
Abstract:
Half-metallic materials with a high Curie temperature (T-C) have many potential applications in spintronics. Magnetic metal free two-dimensional (2D) half-metallic materials with a honeycomb structure contain graphene-like Dirac bands with pi orbitals and show excellent aspects in transport properties. In this article, by investigating a series of 2D organometallic frameworks with a honeycomb structure using first principles calculations, we study the origin of forming half-metallicity in this kind of 2D organometallic framework. Our analysis shows that charge transfer and covalent bonding are two crucial factors in the formation of half-metallicity in organometallic frameworks. (i) Sufficient charge transfer from metal atoms to the molecules is essential to form the magnetic centers. (ii) These magnetic centers need to be connected through covalent bonding, which guarantee the strong ferromagnetic (FM) coupling. As examples, the organometallic frameworks composed by (1,3,5)-benzenetricarbonitrile (TCB) molecules with noble metals (Au, Ag, Cu) show half-metallic properties with T-C as high as 325 K. In these organometallic frameworks, the strong electronegative cyano-groups (CN groups) drive the charge transfer from metal atoms to the TCB molecules, forming the local magnetic centers. These magnetic centers experience strong FM coupling through the d-p covalent bonding. We propose that most of the 2D organometallic frameworks composed by molecule-CN-noble metal honeycomb structures contain similar half metallicity. This is verified by replacing TCB molecules with other organic molecules. Although the TCB-noble metal organometallic framework has not yet been synthesized, we believe the development of synthesizing techniques and facility will enable the realization of them. Our study provides new insight into the 2D half-metallic material design for the potential applications in nanotechnology.

Title: 
Adhesion mechanics of graphene on textured substrates
Abstract:
Graphene; the two dimensional form of carbon, has excellent mechanical, electrical and thermal properties and a variety of potential applications including nano-electro-mechanical systems, protective coatings, transparent electrodes in display devices and biological applications. Adhesion plays a key role in many of these applications. In addition, it has been proposed that the electronic properties of graphene can be affected by elastic deformation caused by adhesion of graphene to its substrate. In light of this, we present here a continuum mechanics based theoretical framework to understand the effect of nanoscale morphology of substrates on adhesion and mechanics of graphene. In the first part, we analyzed the adhesion mechanics of graphene on one and two dimensional periodic corrugations. We carried out molecular statics simulations and found the results to be in good agreement with our theory. We modeled adhesive interactions as surface forces due to a Lennard-Jones 6-12 potential in both our analysis and simulations and in principle any other interaction potential can be used with our methodology. The results show that graphene adheres conformally to substrates with large curvatures. We showed in principle that the theory developed here can be extended to substrates with arbitrary textures that can be represented by a Fourier series. In the second part, we study the mechanics of peeling of graphene ribbons from one dimensional sinusoidally textured substrates. In the molecular statics simulations, we observed two key features in the peel mechanics of the ribbons - the ribbons slide over the substrate and undergo adhesion and peeling near the crack front in an oscillatory manner, the frequency of which reveals the wavelength of the underlying substrate. Our theory qualitatively captures these features of the peel mechanics and is general enough that it can be extended to other two dimensional materials like Molybdenum Disulphide (MoS2), Boron Nitride (BN) or other thin films and different kinds of interaction potentials.

Title: 
Towards a new approach for modeling the behavior of granular materials: A mesoscopic-macroscopic change of scale
Abstract:
This paper constitutes a preliminary demonstration of the feasibility of a multi-scale approach for the definition of a constitutive law for granular materials. The case of two-dimensional granular materials was considered and the reasoning was built on 2D Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations of 2D biaxial tests performed on sample made of disks. The change of scale relied on an intermediary local scale called the meso-scale which was based on the existence of meso-domains defined as closed loops of particles in contact. At the meso-scale, six sets of meso-domains or phases, with different properties in terms of local texture, have been defined. Then, an elastic-hardening-plastic model was designed at the phase scale and the identification of the model parameters was performed on a stress path denoted compression stress path. The model parameters defined for each phase were found correlated with the initial meso-texture of the considered phase and with the orientation of the loading path with respect to the phase orientation. The change of scale allowed us to obtain a modeling at the sample scale in good agreement with the DEM results on the compression stress path. Finally, the relevance of the model and of the approach were tested on a different stress path denoted unloading stress path. This was performed both at the level of the six phases and at the sample scale. The results were found to be in good agreement with the DEM simulations, which tends to validate the general approach presented in this paper, including the definition of the phases at the meso-scale, the design of a constitutive model at this scale, and the change of scale process to obtain the behavior of the material at the sample scale.

Title: 
Application of the virtual fields method to large strain anisotropic plasticity
Abstract:
The identification of the plastic behaviour of sheet metals at severe deformation is extremely important for many industrial application such as metal forming, crashworthiness, automotive, aerospace, piping, etc. In this paper, the virtual fields method (VFM) was employed to identify the constitutive parameters of anisotropic plasticity models. The method was applied using the finite deformation theory in order to account for large strains. First the theoretical principles to implement the method are described in details, especially how to derive the stress field from the strain field. Afterwards a numerical, validation was performed using the Hill48 model. Several aspects were studied with the numerical model: the effect of the used virtual fields, the minimum number of specimens required to identify the parameters, the stress distribution obtained from the specimen and its influence in the identification performance. A brief analysis on the influence of noise is also conducted. Finally a series of experiments was conducted on notched specimens of stainless steel, cut along different anisotropic directions. The displacement and strain fields were obtained by digital image correlation. Afterwards, the VFM was used to identify the parameters of the Hill48 model and the Yld2000-2D model. In this case, the Hill48 model was not able to correctly describe the material behaviour, while a rather good agreement was found with the Yld2000-2D model. The potential and the limitation of the proposed method are finally discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: 
The novel use of phase change materials in an open type refrigerated display cabinet: A theoretical investigation
Abstract:
In this paper, 2D CFD models have been,developed for a prototype refrigerated open type multi-deck display cabinet with and without integrated phase change material (PCM). The models can predict the effect of adding a PCM container on cabinet efficiencies, air temperature distributions, product temperatures and air flow patterns inside the cabinet at a range of operating conditions including space air temperatures and evaporator air velocities. To validate the cabinet models, the prototype cabinet was mounted in an air conditioned chamber and extensive experiments were conducted at constant space air temperature and relative humidity. The cabinet models have therefore been validated through comparison with experiment results for air temperatures at different locations of the airflow path and of food products. Simulation results show that significant energy can be saved through the installation of a PCM container. Further benefits include greater stabilization of product temperatures during defrost periods for the modified display cabinet. Consequently, the validated models can be used to explore and analyse the cabinet performance and control strategies at various operating and design conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title: 
2D and 3D shell models for the free vibration investigation of functionally graded cylindrical and spherical panels
Abstract:
The paper shows the free vibration investigation of simply supported functionally graded material (FGM) shells. Spherical and cylindrical shell geometries are investigated for two different material configurations which are one-layered FGM structures and sandwich structures embedding an internal FGM core. A three-dimensional (3D) exact shell model and different two-dimensional (2D) computational models are compared in terms of frequencies and vibration modes. The proposed numerical solutions are typical 2D finite elements (FEs), and classical and advanced generalized 2D differential quadrature (GDQ) solutions. High and low frequency orders are investigated for thin and thick simply supported shells. Vibration modes are fundamental to compare the 3D exact shell model and 2D numerical solutions. The 2D finite element results based on the classical Reissner-Mindlin theory are calculated using a typical commercial FE software. Classical and advanced GDQ 2D models use the generalized unified formulation. The 3D exact shell model uses the differential equations of equilibrium written in general orthogonal curvilinear coordinates and developed in layer-wise (LW) form. The differences between 2D numerical results and 3D exact results depend on the thickness ratio and geometry of the structure, the considered mode and the frequency order, the lamination sequence and materials.

Title: 
Facile synthesis route for MoS2-polyvinylpyrrolidone aerogels
Abstract:
Three-dimensional (3D) aerogels with low density, high porosity and large surface area have attracted increasing attention and exhibit numerous applications. However, the material types of aerogels are still very limited. Herein, we report a facile synthesis route to prepare MoS2-polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) aerogels via direct frozen-drying from primitive solution with PVP, which plays a key role to obtain aerogels. The good wettability both on water and oil of PVP makes it easily cover on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets, which promotes the sheets connection with each other. The density of the obtained MoS2-PVP aerogels can be tuned from 9.2 to 33.8 mg/cm(3) via simply changing the concentrations of the precursors. Importantly, our current approach has been successfully applied to prepare other 2D or 1D material-PVP aerogels, taking boron nitride-PVP and, carbon nanotubes-PVP aerogels as examples.

Effect of reaction temperature and time on the electrochemical properties of nickel hydroxide nanosheets
Abstract:
2D (Two-dimensional) Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets is synthesized by hydrothermal method with nickel nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine as raw materials. Herein, the effect of reaction temperature and time on the electrochemical performance of Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets are studied. The results showed that morphology and performance appeared great changes as the reaction time and temperature changed. The maximum specific capacitance of 1404.6 F g(-1) at current density of 1.5 A g(-1) by chronopotentiometry is achieved for Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets in 6.0M KOH when reaction temperature and time are 140 degrees C and 8 h. Moreover, the capacitance only reduced to 88% after 2000 times charge and discharge of constant current. Such results demonstrated that Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets is a promising electrode material for the practical application of high-performance supercapacitor and it is worthy of further investigation.

Title: 
A novel approach for the preparation of nanosized Gd2O3 structure: The influence of surface force on the morphology of ball milled particles
Abstract:
This work investigates the effect of inter-particle forces arising from adsorbed typical cationic and anionic surfactants on the morphology of ball milled gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3). The experimental outcomes are interpreted in terms of stabilization and interaction mechanisms of fine washed Gd2O3 particles (size diameter <1 pm) in aqueous medium under the variation of surface forces arising of adsorbed surfactant. After ball milling and washing, the point of zero charge or isoelectric point (IEP) of Gd2O3 particles suspension is at pH 11 where its maximum yield stress is observed. Because of hydrophobic interaction, the maximum yield stress increases by 30 times by adsorbed sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and its IEP shifts slightly to a lower pH. By cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), the yield stress also increases by a much smaller extent (3 times) and shifts to a higher pH of similar to 12.5. Without surfactants, the microstructure of dried Gd2O3 displays the coarse particles of various shapes, i.e. rod, spherical and cubic shapes. This indicates that the milled particles remain agglomerated in dispersion. In the presence of adsorbed anionic SDS, the particles are refined together with numerous 2D nanowire or nano-rod particles at pH similar to 8. In contrast, coarser particles with absence of nano-rods are found when cationic CTAB is used to modify the Gd2O3 surface at a pH of about 12.5. The SDS-modified suspension exhibits a much higher yield stress, which results from finer particles in suspension. This is invoked from an organic shell formed by the high adsorbability of negatively charged heads of SDS into the bare positive charge density of the particle. The organic SDS shell prevents the fine particles from re-welding during the dispersing and annealing route. This work develops an inexpensive ball-milling approach with assisted SDS surfactant for mass production of nanosized Gd2O3 from bulky gadolinium material. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title: 
Pillar-cap shaped arrays of Ag/SiO2 multilayers after annealing treatment as a SERS-active substrate
Abstract:
The "pillar-cap" shaped arrays of Ag/SiO2 multilayers were prepared on 2D PS template by sputtering Ag and SiO2 materials alternatively. Annealing under argon accelerated the interface diffusion between Ag and SiO2 sublayers. Some Ag nanoparticles squeezed into SiO2 sublayer through the pinholes in SiO2 sublayer and the corona-like structure consisting of SiO2-trapped Ag nanoparticles formed on the surfaces of the pillar-cap arrays. The sizes of Ag nanoparticles varied from 2 nm to 5 nm, depending on the annealing temperature. The separations of 1-2 nm SiO2 were generated between Ag particles and underlying Ag sublayer, which provided a lot of hot spot sites for SERS. This fabrication method could avoid the unnecessary and cumbersome stages in chemical surface modification, which made the substrate a promising candidate for the SERS detection.

Title: 
Micellar crowding and branching in a versatile catanionic system
Abstract:
The catanionic system didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB)-sodium (STDC)-D2O is characterized by an exceptionally extended L-1 region. The comparison of self coefficient of the solvent and the DDAB embedded in the micelles provided information about tion of the aggregates. Moreover, correlating self-diffusion and N-14 NMR relaxation measurements insight could be obtained regarding the translational and rotational micellar motions in the crowded tions of systems with 0.2 DDAB-STDC molar ratio. H-1 2D NMR spectra gave some hints about the arrangement of DDAB and STDC within the aggregates. For samples with 1.8 and 2.6 DDAB/STD ratios the N-14 data were in agreement with the presence of somewhat branched, interconnected Na-23 and (81) Br dynamic parameters resulted particularly sensitive to the surrounding environment. The peculiar rheological behaviour of the, highly concentrated, branched micelles samples, namely steady oscillations in the step tests, was found to be an example of instability originated by the effect of material elasticity and slippage at the fixed wall.
